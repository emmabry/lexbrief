Prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/979 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 on regulatory technical standards on key financial information in the summary of a prospectus, the publication and classification of prospectuses, advertisements for securities, supplements to a prospectus, and the notification portal
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/980 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 on format, content, scrutiny and approval of the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/528 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 on the minimum information content of the document to be published for a prospectus exemption in connection with a takeover by means of an exchange offer, a merger or a division
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the prospectus regulation), as supplemented by Delegated Regulations (EU) 2019/979, 2019/980 and 2019/528, aims to help companies, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), access different forms of finance in the European Union (EU). It does so by simplifying and streamlining the rules and procedures for drawing up, approving and distributing the prospectus* they publish when offering securities* to the public or admitting securities to trading on a regulated market.
The legislation reduces costly and burdensome red tape for companies and enables investors to make the right investment decision by providing comprehensible, easy to analyse and concise information.
KEY POINTS
              
The regulation:
removes the need for a prospectus for any offer of securities to the public, including crowdfunding (raising money from a large group of people, often via the internet) projects, below €1 million (previously the limit was €100,000);
allows EU Member States to be exempt from the need for a prospectus for offers of securities to the public of up to €8 million, provided that they do not require notification (a ‘passport’);
sets out rules to curb the tendency to overload prospectuses with generic risk factors;
strengthens supervisory convergence by harmonising scrutiny and approval of prospectuses (including the applicable timelines) throughout the EU;
enables companies that frequently issue securities to use the universal registration document to secure fast-track approval from supervisors within 5 days;
introduces a European online database, operated free of charge by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), containing all prospectuses approved in the European Economic Area.
The regulation requires a prospectus to enable an investor to make an informed decision. It must include:
assets, liabilities, profits, losses, financial position and prospects for the issuer and any guarantor;
rights attached to the securities;
reasons for issuing the securities and their impact on the issuer;
a clear and accurate seven-page summary (except for the admission to trading of non-equity securities only targeting qualified investors), which provides: an introduction with warnings that the investor could lose all or part of the invested capital,key information on the securities, including the type and class of securities and the rights attached to the securities,information about the issuer,a brief description of the nature and scope of a guarantee.
The regulation establishes a standardised and simplified EU growth prospectus for:
SMEs, defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (the MiFID II directive) (see summary) as companies which meet at least two of the following three criteria: an average number of employees during the financial year of less than 250,a total balance sheet not exceeding €43 million,an annual net turnover not exceeding €50 million;
issuers, other than SMEs, whose securities are traded or to be traded on an SME growth market (a market that offers access to capital for SMEs), with an average market capitalisation (market value of the company’s shares) of below €500 million;
offerors of securities issued by issuers referred to in the two previous points;
non-listed companies (not listed on any stock market) which offer securities to the public of less than €20 million in any given 12 months, provided that they have fewer than 500 employees;
issuers, other than SMEs, that offer shares to the public and at the same time seek admission of those shares to trading on an SME growth market, provided that: such issuers have no shares already admitted to trading on an SME growth market,the combined value of the final offer price (or, if not available, the maximum price) and the total number of shares outstanding immediately after the share offer to the public is less than €200 million.
The abovementioned companies can benefit from this tailored prospectus provided that they have no securities admitted to trading on a regulated market.
The regulation provides for a simplified prospectus for companies listed for at least 18 months on a regulated market or an SME growth market and wishing to issue additional shares or raise debt (secondary issuance).
The regulation harmonises the minimum information content of the document to be published for a prospectus exemption in connection with a takeover by means of an exchange offer, a merger or a division.
Amending regulations
Regulation (EU) 2019/2115 seeks to promote the use of SME growth markets by reducing formalities and administrative burdens on SMEs in terms of disclosure obligations and a simplified prospectus.
Regulation (EU) 2020/1503 introduces a prospectus exemption for offers of securities to the public made by crowdfunding service providers that do not exceed the threshold of €5 million in accordance with the conditions specified in that regulation.
Regulation (EU) 2021/337 introduces a new ‘EU recovery prospectus’ to help companies recover from the COVID-19 crisis. This shorter prospectus, with a maximum length of 30 pages plus a two-page summary, makes it easier for companies to raise capital to meet their funding needs, while ensuring adequate information is provided to investors. The recovery prospectus will be available for capital increases of up to 150% of outstanding capital within a period of 12 months and applies until the end of 2022.
Delegated acts
The European Commission has adopted the following acts.
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/980 laying down details of the precise content and format of the prospectus, as well as concerning the scrutiny and approval of the prospectus.
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/979 laying down details of the key financial information in the summary of the prospectus, the publication and classification of the prospectus, the advertisement for the securities and the supplement to a prospectus.

FROM WHEN DO THE REGULATIONS APPLY?
Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 and Delegated Regulations (EU) 2019/979 and (EU) 2019/980 have applied since 21 July 2019.
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/528 has applied since 15 April 2021.
BACKGROUND
Directive 2003/71/EC was designed to make it easier for companies to raise capital throughout the EU on the basis of approval from just one national supervisor. This gave a ‘passport’ for prospectuses containing cross-border offers. Regulation (EU) 2017/1129, which repeals and replaces Directive 2003/71/EEC, addresses the areas of legal uncertainty and unjustified administrative burdens which had emerged over time. It is considered a major milestone towards a European capital markets union.

It aims at creating an effective single market for UWB systems. ‘Maximum mean power spectral density’ means the average power per unit bandwidth (centred on that frequency) radiated in the direction of the maximum level under the specified conditions. of the radio device under test at a particular frequency. ‘peak power’ is the power contained within a 50 MHz bandwidth at the frequency at which the highest mean radiated power occurs. (j) ‘onboard aircraft’ Means the use of radio links for communications purposes inside an aircraft. (k) 'LT1' means systems intended for general location tracking of people and objects. ‘Trigger-before-transmit’ mitigation is defined as a UWB transmission that is only initiated when necessary, specifically where the system indicates that UWB devices are nearby. The communication is either triggered by a user or by the vehicle. The existing LDC mitigation applies (or alternatively TPC) for vehicular access systems in the 6-8,5 GHz range. Material sensing devices based on UWB technology must comply either with the generic UWB regulation or with the specific limits for material sensing devices as defined in sections 5.2 and 5.3. Emissions radiated by a material sensing device must not exceed the limits of the regulation for generic use of UWB in section 1. LBT mechanism to ensure the protection of radio services listed below. Peak power threshold values for the LBT mechanism are defined in the following table. Radio service to be detected: Radiodetermination service + 8dBm/MHz. 7,45 to 7,55 GHz (Meteorological Satellite) protection: – 51,3 – 20 × log10(10[km]/x[km))(dBm/MHz) for heights above ground of over 1 000 m. (10) 7,75 to 7,.9 GHz (meteorological satellite) protection. (11) Devices using the Listen Before Talk (‘LBT’) mechanism are permitted to operate in the 1,215 GHz to 1,73 GHz frequency range. (12) To protect the radio services, non-fixed installations must fulfil the following requirement. Within the 3,1 GHz – 4,8 GHz band, devices implementing LDC mitigation technique are permitted to operate with a maximum mean e.i.r. spectral density of – 41,3 dBm/MHz. When DAA is implemented, note 5 applies. Alternative mitigation techniques may be used if they ensure at least an equivalent performance and level of spectrum protection.","Short range devices, RLAN (WiFi), Internet of Things, ultra-wide band (UWB) equipment and Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS)

WHAT ARE THE AIMS OF THE DIRECTIVE AND DECISIONS?
The implementing decisions mostly concern harmonisation, while others deal with specific frequency bands for specific purposes, in addition to limits on signal strength and harmful interference where applicable. EU countries are responsible for radio spectrum management, and the amendments reflect how European and international harmonisation and technical agreements have evolved.
The ‘DECT’ directive designates the 1 880-1 900 MHz frequency band for digital cordless communications by 1 January 1992 and obliges EU countries to bring into force the necessary national laws, regulations and administrative rules.
KEY POINTS
The decisions
The implementing decisions cover radio equipment devices that are operated through general authorisation or on an unlicensed or shared basis by end-users. This includes radio local access network devices (wi-fi) devices which have shown massive growth in demand for radio spectrum, as acknowledged in the 2018 European Electronic Communications Code.
Many of these acts are harmonisation decisions. Others deal with frequency bands for different purposes, such as a huge variety of short range devices, Internet of Things (IoT) equipment, ultra-wide band equipment, alarms, door openers, medical implants, intelligent transport systems, radio frequency identification devices (RFID), radio determination, ground probing, and new types of machine-to-machine devices, as well as equipment for programme making and special events (PMSE) such as wireless video links or microphones and digital cordless telephones.
A further general authorisation band relates to vehicle safety, in particular to the operation of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS).
The various implementing decisions cover the following radio spectrum, in addition to limits on signal strength and harmful interference where applicable:
the 5 GHz frequency band (5 150-5 350 MHz and 5 470-5 725 MHz) for wireless access systems, including radio local area networks (WAS/RLANs — wi-fi broadband);
the 3 400-3 800 MHz frequency band for terrestrial systems for ‘fixed, nomadic and mobile electronic communications networks’;
the 5 875-5 935 MHz frequency band for safety-related applications of Intelligent Transport Systems;
the radio spectrum for use by short-range devices;
the 24 GHz range radio spectrum band for the time-limited use by automotive short-range radar equipment;
radio spectrum use by wireless audio programme-making and special events equipment;
the 2 010-2 025 MHz frequency band for portable or mobile wireless video links and cordless cameras used for programme making and special events;
the 900 MHz and 1 800 MHz frequency bands for terrestrial systems capable of providing electronic communications services in relation to the Internet of Things;
radio spectrum for use by short-range devices within the 874-876 and 915-921 MHz frequency bands;
radio spectrum for equipment using ultra-wideband technology, such as vehicle and aircraft location tracking.
Directive 91/287/EEC
The directive obliges EU countries to designate the 1 880-1 900 MHz frequency band for digital cordless communications by 1 January 1992.

32019R1122,"All allowances issued from 1 January 2012 onwards are held in a Union Registry. A new period of economy-wide legislation applies from 2021 that is the start of a new period for the EU ETS. The Union Registry is a standardised and secured electronic database containing common data elements. From 3 January 2018 spot emission allowances listed in point (11) of Section C of Annex I to Directive 2014/65/EU are classified as financial instruments. This classification means that spot emission allowance come within the scope of Directive 98/26/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. The requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 389/2013 should be reviewed and updated with the purpose of ensuring their effectiveness while taking into account proportionality. accounts, authentication and access rights should be applied to protect the security of information held in the Union Registry. This Regulation lays down general, operational and maintenance requirements concerning the Union Registry. It applies to allowances created for the purposes of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) The central administrator shall ensure that the Union Registry maintains a direct communication link with the EUTL for the purposes of checking and recording transactions with allowances. The Commission shall coordinate the implementation of this Regulation with the national administrators of each Member State and the central administrator. Every account shall have an administrator who shall be responsible for administering the account. Accounts shall be governed by the laws and fall under the jurisdiction of the Member State of their administrator.  Directive 2003/87/EC still remains with the aircraft operator. Aircraft operator must ensure that there is no conflict of interest amongst the mandated person or entity and competent authorities. The central administrator shall ensure that authorised representatives of accounts in the Union Registry can access the relevant accounts. Each account shall have at least two authorised representatives with one of the following combination of rights: (a) initiate processes; (b) approve processes, if required; (c), initiate processes and approve processes initiated by another authorised representative. Account holders must confirm to the national administrator by 31 December each year that their account information remains complete, up-to-date, accurate and true. Operators and aircraft operators shall notify the administrator of their account within 10 working days if they have undergone a merger or a split. The execution of the proposed change shall be immediate for the deletion of accounts from the trusted account list. For all other changes, the execution shall take place at 12.00 Central European Time (CET) on the fourth working day following the proposal. If there is a positive balance of allowances on an account which an administrator is to close in accordance with Articles 24, 25, 26 and 28, the administrator shall request the account holder to specify another account to which such allowances shall be transferred. The administrator may transfer allowances to its national holding account or set the account status to closure pending. Each operator and aircraft operator shall select a verifier from the list of verifiers registered with the national administrator administering its account. Annual emissions data shall be submitted using the format set out in Annex IX. All approved emissions shall be marked 'verified' by 31 March. The central administrator shall ensure that all transfers specified in Article 55 to accounts indicated on the trusted account list are executed immediately if they are proposed for execution between 10:00 and 16:00 CET on working days. An authorised representative may initiate aborting a transaction at least two hours before its execution. An allowance shall be a fungible, dematerialised instrument that is tradable on the market. No law, regulation, rule or practice on the setting aside of contracts or transactions shall lead to the unwinding in the registry of a transaction that has become final and irrevocable under this Regulation. An account holder or a third party shall not be prevented from exercising any right or claim resulting from the underlying transaction. The central administrator shall transfer aviation allowances to the EU Aviation Allocation Account in a quantity corresponding to the number of allowances to be allocated free of charge determined by the Commission's decision. The number of aviation allowances in the special reserve is increased by a decision adopted pursuant to Article 3e(3) of Directive 2003/87/EC. At the end of each trading period, the central Administrator shall transfer all allowances remaining on the EU Special Reserve Account to theEU Aviation Total Quantity Account. The national administrator shall indicate in the national allocation table for each operator, for each year and for each legal basis set out in Annex X, whether or not an installation should receive an allocation. The central administrator shall ensure that the Union Registry transfers general allowances automatically. The central administrator shall ensure that an aircraft operator can transfer returning excess allowances to the EU Aviation Allocation Account. The Commission may instruct the central administrator to suspend the transfer of allowances as specified in an auction table. Transfers of allowances are subject to the rules of the Union Registry. An allowance that was already surrendered may not be surrendered again. Deleted allowances shall not be recorded as surrendered for any emissions. The Union Registry and the EUTL must be available for access by account representatives and national administrators 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The website of the Union Registry shall be available in all official languages. Suspension of all access due to a security breach or a security risk. Suspension of access to allowances in the case of a suspected fraudulent transaction. Cooperation with relevant competent authorities and notification of money laundering, terrorist financing or criminal activity. The Commission may temporarily suspend the acceptance by the EUTL of some or all processes originating from the Union Registry if it is not operated and maintained in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation. The information referred to in paragraph 2 shall be forwarded to the FIU of the Member State of the national administrator. The data reconciliation process referred to in Article 73(1) shall be final when all inconsistencies between the information contained in the Union Registry and the EUTL for a specific time and date have been resolved. The Commission shall make available to national administrators data exchange and technical specifications laying down operational requirements. National administrators shall ensure that information required by this Regulation is processed in accordance with relevant provisions of Union and national law. Personal data may be retained, with access restricted to the central administrator, for additional five years only for the purposes of investigation, detection, prosecution, tax administration or enforcement, auditing and financial supervision of activities involving allowances. National administrators may not release additional information held in the Union Registry unless this is permitted under Article 80. The central administrator, the national administrators or other authorities, bodies natural or legal persons, which receive confidential information pursuant to this Regulation, may use it only in the performance of their duties. Europol shall obtain permanent read-only access to data stored in the Union Registry and the EUTL for the purposes of Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2016/794. Accounts opened pursuant to Article 18 of Regulation (EU) No 389/2013 shall be transformed into trading accounts. Kyoto units may be held in ETS accounts in the Union Registry until 1 July 2023. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to implement this Regulation. Regulation (EU) No 389/2013 is repealed with effect from 1 January 2021.

Union registry for emissions trading system allowances
SUMMARY OF:
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/1122 on the functioning of the Union registry
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
It aims to guarantee accurate accounting for all allowances issued under the European Union (EU) emissions trading system.
KEY POINTS
EU registry
The EU registry is a single, centralised online database run by the European Commission that holds accounts for operators of facilities such as power stations and airline operators.
It covers all countries taking part in the EU greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme (EU ETS), set up by Directive 2003/87/EC, which aims to reduce emissions in a cost-effective manner as part of the EU’s policy to tackle climate change.
The registry records: facilities covered by the directive in each EU Member State and any free allowances allocated to those facilities;accounts of companies or individuals with such allowances;transfers of allowances performed by account holders;verified annual CO2 emissions of facilities and airline operators;the annual reconciliation of allowances and verified emissions.
Phase IV
This regulation sets out the general, operational and maintenance requirements for the EU registry for phase IV of the EU ETS from 2021 to 2030.
It replaces Regulation (EU) No 389/2013 (see summary), which covered phase III (2013–2020) of the EU ETS.
Main elements
The regulation covers a number of aspects, including the following.
The registries system, which is operated and maintained by a central administrator. The regulation introduces a EU transaction log (EUTL), which automatically checks, records and authorises all transactions between accounts in the registry. It replaces the Community independent transaction log from phase II.
The status and administration of accounts. The regulation simplifies rules on account management with the aim of reducing the burden on national administrators.
Specific rules for the EU ETS registry covering issues such as: verified emissions and compliance;transactions, including rules on the execution of transfers and the creation, allocation and transfer of allowances;improving links between the EU ETS and other ETS schemes where a linking agreement was concluded (e.g. the Swiss ETS – see summary).
Technical rules and requirements for the registry and EU transaction log, including national helpdesks for account holders and representatives.
Repeal
It repeals and replaces Regulation (EU) No 389/2013. The latter continues to apply until 31 December 2025 to all operations in relation to the 2013–2020 trading period and to the Kyoto accounts until the true-up (the additional period for the completion of commitments) of the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol in 2023.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 1 January 2021.

SUMMARY OF:
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/856 with regard to the operation of the Innovation Fund
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
The Innovation Fund introduced in Directive 2003/87/EC is designed to support innovative initiatives as part of EU emissions trading system (ETS)*, the EU’s cornerstone policy to tackle climate change by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.This regulation sets out detailed rules about how the fund operates.
KEY POINTS
              
The regulation sets out detailed rules for the Innovation Fund, including
operational objectives;
forms of support provided;
application procedure;
how projects are selected;
how the fund is governed;
reporting, monitoring, evaluation, control, and publicity.
Objectives and forms of support
The fund provides financial support for projects demonstrating highly innovative technologies, processes or products with significant potential to reduce GHG emissions, while attracting additional public and private resources.
Support will be in the form of grants, or combining EU grants with financial instruments under the EU’s unified investment support instrument (InvestEU), which replaces the current European Fund for Strategic Investments for the period 2021-2027. Funding can also take any of the other forms outlined in Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 (the ‘Financial Regulation’), in particular prizes, and procurement.
Application and selection
Applicants are invited to apply for financial support for eligible projects following a call for proposals issued by the European Commission after consultation with EU countries. Projects are selected based on criteria including:
the potential to avoid GHG emissions;
degree of innovation of the projects compared to the state of the art;
maturity of planning, business model, financial and legal structure; prospect of concluding the financial close of the project within a pre-defined time period of no more than 4 years;
technical and market potential for widespread application or future cost reductions;
cost efficiency of the project based on a formula balancing costs against GHG emissions avoided, energy generated, or CO2 stored (carbon capture and storage) in the first 10 years of operation.
Governance and administration
The Commission directly manages the Fund’s operation except where implementing bodies are delegated. EU countries are consulted about short-listed projects before any decisions on awards are made.
Entities receiving aid should display on their websites information about projects supported under this regulation, including explicit reference to the Innovation Fund support received, as well as ensuring that coherent, effective and targeted information on the support reaches multiple audiences, including the media and the public.

22020A0724(01),"The European Union and the Government of the People's Republic of China have signed an agreement on civil aviation safety. The aim is to enable the reciprocal acceptance of findings of compliance and certificates issued by either Party's Competent Authorities. The scope of cooperation under this Agreement includes the following areas: airworthiness Certificates and Monitoring of Civil Aeronautical Products. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as limiting the authority of a Party to: (a) Determine, through its legislative, regulatory and administrative measures, the level of protection it considers appropriate for safety. (b) Take all appropriate and immediate measures whenever there is a reasonable risk that a product, a service or any activity within the scope of this Agreement, may compromise the health or safety of persons or the environment. A Joint Committee is established, consisting of representatives from each Party. The Joint Committee shall be responsible for the effective functioning of this Agreement and shall meet at regular intervals to evaluate the effectiveness of its implementation. This Agreement, including its Annexes, is binding on both Parties and shall remain in force until terminated by either Party. A Party may terminate this Agreement at any time upon six months written notification to the other Party. The Parties may amend this Agreement by mutual written consent. “Design Certificate” means a recognition by a Party that the design or change to a design of a civil aeronautical product meets airworthiness standards. Changes in type design are classified as minor and major. A “minor change” is one that has no appreciable effect on the mass, balance, structural strength, reliability, operational characteristics, noise, fuel venting, exhaust emission. The Parties agree that, subject to the continued qualification requirements defined in point 5 of this Annex, the demonstration of capability of any design organisation to assume its responsibilities is sufficiently controlled through a system of design organisation certification. The level of involvement of the Validating Authority during validation processes shall be mainly determined by the experience and records of the Competent Authority of the other Party. Design Certificates that have been, or are in the process of being, issued by the Certificating Authority are either automatically accepted or validated by the Validating Authority. The validating Authority does not issue its own corresponding certificate. Some-specific sets of operational documents and data, including Operational Suitability Data in the European Union system, are provided by the type certificate holder. The Parties agree that a Production Certificate issued by the Competent Authority of the Exporting Party to organisations primarily located in that Party can be extended to include manufacturing sites and facilities located in the territory of the other Party. A list of Chinese Production Certificate holders, including holders of Chinese Technical Standard Order Approvals, will be published. New aircraft may be exported only if a holder of either a type certificate or a restricted type certificate/type certificate for restricted category exists to support continued airworthiness of that aircraft. Each Party agrees to assist, upon request, the other Party in obtaining data and information regarding the configuration of the aircraft. The Parties agreed that in the design and production domains, the levels of reliance on certificates, approvals and findings of compliance will be different during a transitional period. Recurrent mutual assessments shall continue between the Parties as detailed in the Technical Implementation Procedures. Major changes and repairs approved by the EU Competent Authority or by an approved organisation under EU law. Non-significant Supplemental type certificate: validation through an administrative process detailed in Technical Implementation Procedures.","EU-China agreement on civil aviation safety

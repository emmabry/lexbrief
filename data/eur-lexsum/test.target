summary of   Decision 2013/94/EU — conclusion of the Regional Convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin   what is the aim of the decision   It finalises the Regional Convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin  *  .   This convention enables countries of the pan-Euro-Mediterranean zone (listed in key points below) to benefit from common rules and preferential customs treatment.   It aims to promote deeper economic integration and stronger trade links in the area.   key points   A regional convention on the origin of goods traded in the pan-Euro-Mediterranean zone was signed on behalf of the EU in April 2011. The convention brings together in a  single legal instrument  all the rules regarding the origin of goods traded in the context of approximately 60 bilateral free-trade agreements (FTAs) between countries of the pan-Euro-Mediterranean area including the EU’s  Stabilisation and Association process (SAP)  .   Contracting parties   Besides the EU, the contracting parties to this convention are:   the  European Free Trade Association (EFTA)  States: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland;   signatories to the  Barcelona declaration  : Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, Syria, Tunisia and Turkey;   the Faroes;   participants in the SAP process: Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Albania, Montenegro and Serbia, as well as Kosovo (  1  );   the Republic of Moldova, Georgia and Ukraine.    Originating products   For tariff preferences to be applied, the origin of goods has to be established. Goods are considered as products originating in the pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation zone if they are:   wholly obtained (e.g. mined, harvested or, in the case of live animals, born and raised) in the territory of a contracting party;   composed of materials originating in countries that are not signatories to the convention (non-originating materials), but which have been sufficiently worked or processed in the territory of a contracting party (Annex II of Appendix I);   imported from the  European Economic Area (EEA)  and exported to another contracting party.    Pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation zone   The convention operates on the basis of an  accumulation system  whereby contracting parties can use originating products from each other as though they were domestically produced. Under the pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation of origin system, a system of  diagonal cumulation  operates between the EU and many of the countries in question.   Proof of origin    Customs authorities of the exporting country issue  movement   certificates   EUR.1  or EUR-MED as proof of claims of origin. This allows importers in other contracting parties to benefit from the preferential tariff arrangements.   An  origin declaration  or an origin declaration EUR-MED may also be given by an approved exporter.    Arrangements for administrative cooperation   The parties’ customs authorities will coordinate with one another (e.g. by sharing specimen impressions of stamps used for the issue of movement certificates EUR.1 and EUR-MED or for verifying proofs of origin.)   Management and implementation   A joint committee made up of representatives of all the contracting parties ensures the management and implementation of the convention.  (  1  ) This designation is without prejudice to positions on status and is in line with  United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244  and the  International Court of Justice Opinion  on the Kosovo Declaration of Independence.   from when does the decision apply  It has applied since 26 March 2012.   background   For more information, see:    Pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation and the PEM Convention  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Rules of origin:  effectively the ‘economic’ nationality of goods traded which has to be determined in order to decide how they are treated in terms of customs duties. Preferential origin is conferred on goods from particular countries that have met certain criteria such as undergoing more working or processing than is required to obtain non-preferential origin.
   Reform of the EU State aid rules on Services of General Economic Interest     Reform of the EU State aid rules on Services of General Economic Interest     This communication aims to launch the political debate on the upcoming revision of the State aid package on Services of General Economic Interest (SGEI).     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 23 March 2011 – “Reform of the EU State Aid Rules on Services of General Economic Interest” [       COM(2011) 146      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY      Context      The package on State aid for Services of General Economic Interest (SGEI) is set to be revised. The current package includes a number of measures adopted in 2005, in particular the       SGEI Decision      and the       SGEI Framework      , in which the Commission clarified the application of Articles 106 and 107 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) (on State aid) to compensation for SGEI.     In its communication       “Towards a Single Market Act”      , the Commission undertook to adopt, by 2011, a communication and a series of measures on services of general interest. The Commission has emphasised that the EU and its member countries must ensure that public services are easier to operate at the appropriate level, adhere to clear financing rules, are of the highest quality and are accessible to everyone. EU competition rules only apply to those services of general interest that are “economic” in nature.      Review of the SGEI State aid rules      The overall objective of the proposed reform of the State aid rules for SGEI is to increase the contribution that SGEI can make to the wider EU economic recovery. EU countries need to guarantee certain services at affordable conditions to their citizens, such as hospitals, education, social services, communications and transport.     In accordance with the requirements of the SGEI Decision and the SGEI Framework, the Commission has conducted a wide consultation. This included asking EU countries to report on the application of the current package on SGEI as well as launching a public consultation. Overall the consultation process concluded that the introduction of the current package on SGEI was generally welcomed and that the existing legal instruments have made a positive contribution to the overall objective of legal certainty. The consultation also, however, demonstrated the need for improvement; in particular, the need for clearer, simpler, more proportionate and more effective instruments to ensure an easier application of the rules. To achieve this, the Commission is considering basing the upcoming reform on the two       key principles      of clarification and a diversified and proportionate approach.     To ensure an improved       clarity      , the Commission is considering providing further guidance on core issues in the field of State aid rules for SGEI. Insofar as concepts are defined by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) as interpreted by the Courts, the Commission’s role is limited to providing guidance on how it understands the TFEU and the case law. The Commission considers giving guidance, inter alia, on:      the distinction between economic and non-economic activities under State aid rules and the qualification of certain entities as undertakings;       the limits that State aid rules impose on EU countries when defining an economic activity as an SGEI;       the conditions under which compensation for certain SGEI provided at local level affects trade between EU countries, thereby falling within the scope of State aid rules;       the requirements which public authorities have to follow under State aid rules when they entrust an undertaking with the performance of an SGEI;       the conditions under which compensation for SGEI does not involve State aid because the tender selects the provider at the least cost for the community or because the price charged is in line with that of an efficient and "well-run" undertaking (these two alternatives derive from the European Court of Justice’s         Altmark        judgment);       how to increase convergence between the application of State aid and public procurement rules;       the interplay between the rules of the package and other sector specific SGEI rules.      The current package on SGEI already distinguishes different levels of scrutiny. In a       diversified and proportionate approach      , the Commission is planning to differentiate to an even larger extent between different types of services depending on the extent to which State aid in these economic sectors poses a serious risk of distorting competition. This would involve:       simplification        of the application of the State aid rules for certain types of social services organised by local communities, which are particular in their financing structure and objectives and which only have a minor impact on intra-EU trade;       an increased emphasis on         efficiency        of large-scale commercial services entrusted with public service obligations, by taking into account the efficiency and quality levels of the SGEI provider in the compensation granted.

   Communication on the practical implementation of directives on health and safety at work     Communication on the practical implementation of directives on health and safety at work     This report examines how the Framework directive of 1989 and five of its individual directives have been transposed and are applied within the Member States. It also draws conclusions on their impact on European health and safety legislation and how they affect the economy and society.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of Regions on the practical implementation of the provisions of the Health and Safety at Work Directives       89/391      (Framework),       89/654      (Workplaces),       89/655      (Work Equipment),       89/656      (Personal Protective Equipment),       90/269      (Manual Handling of Loads) and       90/270      (Display Screen Equipment) [       COM(2004) 62      - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY      LEGAL IMPACT IN THE MEMBER STATES      Directive       89/391/EEC      changed the practical perspective of the protection of the health and safety of workers by introducing an integrated preventive approach and by making ongoing improvement of health and safety conditions at work a requirement. This new approach is based on the fundamental principles which the framework Directive       89/391/EEC      introduced, namely, employer responsibility, prevention, information, training, consultation and participation of workers. Directive       89/391/EEC      and Directives 89/654/EEC,       89/655/EEC      ,       89/656/EEC      ,       90/269/EEC      and       90/270/EEC      led to the rationalisation and simplification of the National legislative corpora. Transposal of the directives obliged the Member States to switch from legislation often based on remedial principles to a preventive approach based on individual behaviour and organisational structures.      MONITORING TRANSPOSAL      Analysis of the transposal of the framework directive has made it possible to highlight shortcomings in nearly all the Member States, particularly as regards scope, employer responsibility, the principles of prevention, the extent of the obligation to evaluate risks to the health and safety of workers, protection and prevention services, the obligation to keep records of risk assessment in all types of companies and, lastly, information, consultation, participation and training of workers.     As far as individual directives are concerned, the situation as regards transposal is more positive and most of the shortcomings observed have been rectified without the need for infringement proceedings, which have, however, been necessary in certain cases.      ACTION ON THE GROUND: PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION      Substantial heterogeneousness continues to exist in the practical implementation of the various directives, depending on the countries, the different sectors of activity and the size of company. Nevertheless, the primary aims of guaranteeing common minimum standards of protection through harmonisation of the recommendations on safety and health, reducing the number of accidents at work and the number of cases of occupational diseases, have been attained.      Publicity and supporting measures      Although National (action plans and awareness-raising campaigns) and European (role of the       European Agency for Health and Safety at Work      ) measures have contributed greatly to better understanding of the new legislation and better awareness by employers and workers alike of their rights and obligations, the impact of these measures varies depending on the economic players to whom they apply. While things run smoothly from this point of view in the bigger companies, this is not the case in the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), where a big effort is needed.      Awareness raising      Despite the huge volume of information available, the level of information among employers and workers, particularly in the SMEs, is insufficient. Employers point to problems in understanding the legislation. This stems from the nature of the provisions, which involve establishing a general objective, and from the fact that there is no information at National level to help employers establish prevention plans tailored to the risks detected in the risk assessment.      Risk assessment, documentation and supervision      The points to be improved concerning the practical implementation of the provisions related to the risk assessment are:      superficial, schematic procedures place tend to focus on obvious risks, while long-term effects (e.g. psychological and psycho-social factors) as well as the more insidious risks, e.g. those caused by chemical substances, are neglected;       as a result, there is no overall or integrated approach to risks and measures are taken in isolation;       risk assessment is often considered as a one-off obligation and lacks continuity;       the effectiveness of steps taken is not sufficiently monitored by employers.       Protective and preventive services      Not all companies comply with their obligation to set up departments to protect against and prevent occupational risks, either by designating a worker to carry out such activities or, if this is not possible, by calling in an external service. This is particularly the case of the SMEs.     The introduction of such services is held up by the lack of qualified personnel, the low quality of the services delivered (unilateral importance attached to the technical aspects, few multi-disciplinary services) and by the tendency for employers to use the cheapest possible services.      Information, consultation, participation and training      Few data are available on information flow but it is clear that the practical implementation of the obligation to inform workers leaves a lot to be desired by comparison with the other obligations which employers have to comply with. This is the case of nearly all the industrial sectors in all the Member Stakes irrespective of size of company. The problem is particularly manifest among temporary workers. Nor is the participation of workers organised satisfactorily despite the range of options proposed by the directives.      Organisation and management of health and safety at work      The growing complexity of work processes, trends in working conditions and changes in the types of risks encountered as a result, call for a transparent and systematic approach to health and safety at work. Yet, with the exception of the bigger companies, safety and health are seldom an integral part of companies' overall management process.      Enforcement      Enforcement of health and safety at work legislation is primarily a matter for the labour inspectorates, often working in conjunction with other specialised monitoring agencies in certain sectors of activity. The progress made with implementation by the Member States is generally measured taking the ratio between the number of labour inspectors in each Member State and the number of inspections performed every year. 1 400 000 inspections are carried out every year in the European Union by approximately 12 000 inspectors.     The entry into force of the new EU health and safety legislation and does not appear to have boosted the number of inspections. In their reports, the Member States point to a chronic lack of resources in their labour inspectorates to cover all aspects of the new legislation, particularly in the SMEs.     The analysis carried out shows that the action of the EU labour inspectorates actively contributes to bringing down the rate of absenteeism due to occupational accidents and diseases and also to changing the approaches of those involved in prevention at workplace level. Further progress is needed in order to improve checks in the SMEs and the high-risk sectors and in order to make warnings and sanctions more dissuasive.      Analysis of two specific cases: SMEs and the public sector       SMEs      The analysis shows that there are major shortcomings in complying with essential elements of EU health and safety legislation in SMEs, in particular as regards risk assessment, workers' participation and training, and in the traditionally high-risk sectors of agriculture and construction. These shortcomings stem primarily from:      the lack of information and specific (targeted information distributed locally) and comprehensible guidelines;       poor capacity and skills in terms of health and safety;       lack of resources to ensure appropriate basic training of workforce and managers;       poor access to effective, specific and specialised technical assistance.       The public sector      The inclusion of the public sector within the scope of the health and safety legislation is a groundbreaking development in most Member States.     Despite problems in certain countries (particularly in the military sector), the transposal of European legislation in the public sector can all in all be considered to be satisfactory. The degree to which it is implemented nonetheless poses certain problems because:      it is widely held in public administration that the risk levels are negligible by comparison with the private sector;       it is not generally for labour inspectorates to intervene in public administration or the in-house departments responsible for this function do not have enough hierarchical autonomy;       the budgets allocated are often limited.       EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE LEGISLATION      The National reports show that the majority of Member States consider that it is as yet too early to make a proper and full evaluation of effectiveness. Although nearly all Member States believe there has been a positive impact, they do not have the data or statistical results available yet to substantiate that impact. Nevertheless, the evaluation that the legislation has contributed to making the workplace safer is supported by general statistical data on occupational health and safety.      Effects on accidents at work and occupational diseases      The most up-to-date statistics (for the year 2000) show that the accident rate per 100 000 workers had fallen from 4513 to 4016 since 1994. Also by comparison with 1994, there was a marked improvement in the rate of fatal accidents in Europe, which fell back from 6423 to 5237 in 2000.      The 1999 labour force survey      and those conducted by the European Foundation for Living and Working Conditions, for their part, show that the active population feels that working conditions have not improved overall. A great deal remains to be done with regard to monitoring and organising work in order to head off intensive working patterns, problems stemming from working on screen, repetitive movements and psychological damage.      Costs and benefits in the enterprises      Member States have indicated in their National reports that due to the lack of indicators they consider that it is not possible to make a full evaluation, but acknowledge that a reduction in accidents at work and worker absenteeism brings about a clear reduction in business costs, which should in turn boost productivity.      General economic effects      In the European Union the costs for accidents at work and work-related illnesses are estimated between 2.6 and 3.8% of the gross National product (GNP). 158 million days of work were lost in the Union in 2000. Around 350 000 workers were obliged to change their job as a result of an accident. Nearly 350 000 workers have various degrees of permanent disability and 15 000 have been forced out of the labour market. However, the fall in the number of accidents at work since the entry into force of Community legislation is estimated to have generated savings of 25 million days of work.     So, while the implementation of this legislation may not be totally satisfactory, it has definitely produced economic benefits.      Effects on employment and competitiveness      The beneficial effects of investment in health and safety at work take some time to filter through. This makes it very difficult for the time being to draw conclusions on the impact of the legislation in question on the competitiveness of the business sector. Cost/benefit analyses will have to be carried out in order to evaluate the short and longer term effects. As an overall conclusion, Member States in their National reports generally indicate that health and safety at work measures contribute towards improved working conditions, boosting productivity, employment and competitiveness.      OVERALL EVALUATION OF IMPLEMENTATION       Positive effects, problems with implementation and suggestions for improving the various Directives       Framework Directive         89/391/EEC       -This downward trend in the number of accidents at work and the aforementioned increase in employers' awareness are considered by the Member States to be the great achievement of Directive       89/391/EEC      . The following positive points were also mentioned:      emphasis on a prevention philosophy;       broadness of scope;       obligation for the employers to perform risk assessments and provide documentation;       obligation for the employer to inform and train workers;       rights and obligations of the workers;       the opportunity to consolidate, rationalise and simplify the National regulations in force.      The main problems pointed to by the Member States arose in the SME context and concerned the administrative obligations and formalities, the financial burden and at the time needed to prepare appropriate measures. Other difficulties were:      the lack of participation by the workers in the operational processes;       the absence of evaluation criteria for National labour inspectorates;       the lack of harmonised European statistical information system on occupational accidents and diseases;       problems in implementing certain provisions in the SMEs.      - If the degree of implementation of the directive is to be improved then there is a need to:      increase the level of application of the Directives in SMEs;       ensure the availability of comprehensive and harmonised statistics on occupational accidents;       provide easy access to information and assistance for employers and workers to make them aware of their rights and obligations;       step up action and allocate the resources necessary to guarantee uniform, effective and equivalent implementation;       identify any provisions of the Directives that have been outdated by technological development and need to be reviewed;       focus greater attention on the specific situation of temporary workers.        Directive           89/654/EEC          on workplaces       - The positive aspects:      regulation of various situations which would not have received the required attention had they not been dealt with by the European Directive, e.g. windows, translucent partitions, doors or gates opening upwards, emergency routes and exits, etc.;       reinforcing regulations on the employers' obligations relating to workplaces used for the first time, and workplaces already in use.      Implementation difficulties:      excessive detail concerning certain aspects, this being detrimental to the proper transposal of the directive ;       unclear distinction made by the Directive between workplaces used for the first time and those already in use ;       the investment required to adopt the new provisions in SMEs.      - Suggestions for improvement:      the need for a co-ordinated approach to the problems regarding environmental conditions, e.g. by exchange of relevant experience among Member States;       the establishment of guidelines and recommendations (with up-to-date data, charts and figures) in order to clarify certain aspects (ventilation, lighting, temperature, dimensions of the workplace, etc.);       examining the provisions which are applicable to teleworking.        Directive           89/655/EEC          on the use of work equipment by workers at work       -The positive points:      minimum safety level for work equipment defined;       National regulations unified and harmonised, which has contributed towards simplification;       scope extended to a greater number of items of work equipment;       standards generally clearer and more specific;       employer awareness raised with regard to the safety level of work equipment;       adaptation, official approval and modernisation of work equipment in use;       more active prevention of risks associated with the use of work equipment;       better analysis of factors to be taken into account when acquiring new equipment.      - Implementation difficulties:      excessive cost for SMEs which do not have the necessary financial resources;       the need for long-term investment to adapt work equipment;       the practical distinction between the Directive on safety in the use of work equipment and the machinery Directive has not been made sufficiently clear;       the definition of various safety levels for a machine already in use and for a new machine makes it difficult to adapt it to the requirements of the Directive.      -Suggestions for improvement:      clarification of the various safety levels for a machine in use and for a new machine;       support measures to smooth over the implementation of the directive, particularly for the SMEs: financial aid, loans, etc;       publication of guidelines on the practical part of the provisions.        Directive           89/656/EEC          on the use by workers of personal protective equipment       - The positive points:      National legislation has been standardised, simplified and co-ordinated;       extension of the regulations to new sectors and new equipment ;       obligation on the employer to assess risks before selecting individual protection equipment and a widespread increase in awareness as regards the conditions to be met by this equipment;       greater detail in the regulations, which entail, for instance, knowing the exact type of activities in which certain individual protection equipment is mandatory.      - Implementation difficulties:      lack of assistance for SMEs, which have difficulty in selecting suitable protection equipment by themselves;       cost of new equipment for small companies;       workers insufficiently familiar with the use of personal protective equipment         .       - Suggestions for improvement:      the Commission should publish specific guidelines and codes of good practice, which would include selection criteria for personal protective equipment;       supplement the annexes to the directive in order to make it easier for companies to choose equipment;       synchronisation and simplification of implementation reports.        Directive           90/269/EEC          on the manual handling of loads       - The positive points:      support for existing regulations on manual handling of loads in some Member States;       regulations which are clear and have been generally applied without problems;       improvements in the level of awareness of employers (taking on board the ergonomics aspects in risk assesment);       these obligations have been put into practice in nearly all sectors of industry.      - Implementation difficulties:      job losses could result from a high level of mechanisation and costs;       some aspects of the Directive are considered too detailed (although this is considered a positive aspect in some Member States);       the possibility that a series of workplaces may cease to be considered as suitable for women;       the absence of standards other than those of load weight and distance, regarding rest periods and rest intervals.      - Suggestions for improvement:      several Member States are of the opinion that limit values should be set, since the margin for interpretation allowed as regards manual handling of loads is excessive;       the Commission should give details concerning evaluation models and guidelines;       the application of ergonomics principles to the handling of materials should be given closer attention.       Directive         90/270/EEC        on work with visual display equipment      - The positive points:      further support for control and improvement of the ergonomics aspects of workstations using visual display equipment;       introduction of rest periods and the workers' right to better health surveillance, in particular eye tests;       these obligations have been put into practice in nearly all sectors of the industry.      - Implementation difficulties      a number of problems are difficult to solve (use of natural light, the ergonomics aspects of seating, the inability to neutralise certain electromagnetic fields);       confusion as to who is authorised to or should carry out eye tests;       problems stemming from teleworking and supervision of working conditions within that framework.      - Suggestions for improvement:      it would be advisable to specify the provisions on changes of activity or rest periods, as well as the persons to whom they should apply;       the problems caused by electromagnetic radiation from terminals, lasers and magnetic fields should be examined;       various Member States consider a review of the Directive to be appropriate, in order to adapt it to technological development.       BACKGROUND      The analysis concerns the transposition and application of the framework directive       89/391      on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work as well as of the first five individual directives, addressing particular workplace environments or risks. The individual directives concern in particular:      minimum requirements for the workplace (Directive         89/654/EEC)        the use of work equipment (Directive         89/655/EEC)        personal protective equipment (Directive         89/656/EEC)        manual handling of loads (Directive         90/269/EEC)        display screen equipment (Directive         90/270/EEC)       This report is the Commission's response to the call made in the framework directive and in the five individual directives to "submit a report on the implementation of the various directives at regular intervals to the European Parliament, the Council and the Economic and Social Committee"     A major input to this Communication are the National reports provided by the Member States in accordance with the directives which state that "Member States shall report to the Commission every five years (every four years for Directives 90/269 and       90/270      ) on the practical implementation of the provisions of this Directive, indicating the points of view of employers and workers". It is also based on a report by independent experts.       Key figures of the act (for the year 2000)         Number of accidents (having resulted in absence from work of over three days): for 100.000 workers, 4016 cases (4539 in 1994);         Fatal accident rate:  5237 cases (643 in 1994);         Cost of accidents at work and of occupational diseases: between 2.6 and 3.8% of GDP         Days of work lost as a result of accidents at work: 158 million;         7% of accident victims are forced to change jobs;         4% of accident victims have to reduce their working hours or suffer varying degrees of permanent disability;         15.000 workers were forced out of the employment market for good following an accident at work;         14% of workers have more than one accident per year.

summary of   Regulation (EU) No 345/2013 on European venture capital funds   what is the aim of the regulation  It aims to  boost the growth and innovation  of companies in the EU, including small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).  It introduces a  European Venture Capital Funds label  , also known as  EuVECA  , and measures to allow managers to set up and market their funds across the EU using a single set of rules. This single rulebook will permit investors to know exactly what they can expect when investing in EuVECA.  It will also enable venture capital funds to be  better positioned  to attract more capital commitments and expand.   key points   The average EU venture capital fund size is circa €60 million, whereas a similar US fund has more than double that. By enabling these EU funds to grow, it should be possible to boost capital contributions to individual companies and enhance their investment impact.  The regulation aims to boost  funds so that they become larger  , to adopt a more diversified investment strategy, so that they can specialise in sectors such as IT, biotechnology and healthcare. This should result in European companies becoming more competitive worldwide.   EuVECA label   To register for the EuVECA label and market their funds across the EU, managers of venture capital funds must set up a fund that:   invests 70% of the capital it receives from investors in supporting eligible companies, such as young and innovative SMEs;   provides equity or quasi-equity finance (i.e. fresh capital) to these companies;   does not use leverage (i.e. the fund is not indebted, because it does not invest more capital than is committed by investors).   The regulation sets out uniform  quality criteria  for managers of qualifying venture capital funds that wish to use the EuVECA label. These requirements cover everything from the way they organise and conduct themselves to the manner in which they inform investors about their activities and investment policies.  These managers must also  register  in the country where the fund is established and provide annual reports. The country where these funds are located is obliged to ensure all the regulation’s rules are respected.  As investing in venture capital funds can be  risky  , the regulation defines  who can invest in EuVECA  : professional investors and certain other categories such as high net worth individuals.   Regulation (EU) 2017/1991  amends Regulation (EU) No 345/2013 on European venture capital funds and its sister-regulation (Regulation (EU) No 346/2013) on  European social entrepreneurship funds (EuSEF)  ,  extending the use of the designations  ‘EuVECA’ and ‘EuSEF’ to  managers of collective investment undertakings   *  authorised under Article 6 of  Directive 2011/61/EU  . It also expands the range of eligible companies, and decreases the costs associated with marketing the funds across the EU.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 22 July 2013 except for Article 9(5), concerning conflicts of interest, which has applied since 15 May 2013. Regulation (EU) 2017/1991, amending Regulation (EU) No 345/2013, has applied since1 March 2018.   background   The EU’s economic growth is largely dependent on its 23 million SMEs, which have also provided 80% of all new jobs in recent years. As traditional bank loans become harder to access, many SMEs now turn to venture capitalists to fund their research, product development or enter new markets.  For more information, see:    Venture capital  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Collective investment undertakings:  investment vehicles that pool investors’ capital and invest that capital collectively through a portfolio of financial instruments such as stocks, bonds and other securities.
   European Defence Agency     European Defence Agency     The aim of the European Defence Agency is to develop defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to promote and enhance European armaments cooperation. It also aims to strengthen the European industrial and technological base, in the field of defence, to create a competitive European defence equipment market and to promote research.     ACT     Council Joint Action       2004/551/CFSP      of 12 July 2004 on the establishment of the European Defence Agency.     SUMMARY     The mission of the European Defence Agency is to support the Council and the Member States in their efforts to improve the European Union’s (EU) defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).     All the EU Member States except Denmark participate in the Agency (under Article       5      of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Denmark does not participate in the formulation and implementation of EU decisions and actions which have defence implications). The Agency has its headquarters in Brussels.     The Agency acts under the authority and the political supervision of the Council. Each year, the Council issues guidelines for the work of the Agency, notably with regard to its work programme and the financial framework of the Agency. The Agency reports regularly to the Council on its activities.      Policy areas      The main tasks of the Agency are:       to develop defence capabilities in the field of crisis management.        The Agency identifies the EU’s future defence capability requirements, coordinates the implementation of the European Capabilities Action Plan and the harmonisation of military requirements, proposes collaborative activities in the operational domain and provides appraisals on financial priorities;        to promote and enhance European armaments cooperation.        The Agency proposes new multilateral cooperative projects, coordinates existing programmes and manages specific programmes;        to strengthen the industrial and technological base in the field of defence and to create a competitive European defence equipment market.        The Agency develops relevant policies and strategies in consultation with the Commission and industry, and develops and harmonises relevant rules and regulations;        to enhance the effectiveness of European defence research and technology.        The Agency promotes and coordinates research aimed at fulfilling future defence capability requirements, in liaison with the Commission.       Organisation      The Agency has legal personality. Its bodies include the Head of the Agency, the Steering Board and the Chief Executive:      the         High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy        . S/he is responsible for the Agency's overall organisation and functioning. S/he also ensures that the guidelines issued by the Council and the decisions of the Steering Board are implemented by the Chief Executive, who reports to him;       the Steering Board is the Agency’s decision-making body. It is composed of one delegate from each participating Member State and one representative from the Commission. It holds at least two meetings each year at the level of Ministers of Defence. It may also meet in specific compositions (for example, at the level of National Defence Research Directors, National Armaments Directors, etc.). The Head of the Agency convenes and chairs the Steering Board’s meetings;       the Agency’s Chief Executive is appointed by the Steering Board on a proposal from the Head of the Agency for a period of three years, which may be extended for two years. The Chief Executive is the head of the Agency’s staff and is responsible for supervising and coordinating the functional units. Furthermore, the Head of the Agency is assisted by two deputies who are also appointed by the Steering Board in accordance with the same procedures.      The Commission is a member of the Steering Board without voting rights and is fully associated with the work of the Agency. The Commission, on behalf of the EU, may also participate in projects or programmes of the Agency.      Ad hoc projects      The Agency offers Member States the option to develop ad hoc projects relating to a specific subject and which bring together only interested Member States. Furthermore, the Chief Executive may authorise third parties to participate in the ad hoc projects. S/he establishes the modalities for cooperation between the Agency and third parties.      Financial rules      The financial provisions applicable to the Agency’s general budget are adopted by the Council, acting unanimously. Revenue consists of miscellaneous revenue and contributions payable by the Member States participating in the Agency.     The Steering Board, on a proposal from the Chief Executive or a Member State, may decide that the Agency may be entrusted by Member States, on a contractual basis, with the administrative and financial management of certain activities within its remit. The Steering Committee may also authorise the Agency to conclude contracts on behalf of certain Member States.      Relations with organisations or third countries      As part of its work programme, the Agency may establish cooperation with third countries. It may also collaborate with international organisations such as the       North Atlantic Treaty Organisation      (NATO) or the       Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation      (OCCAR). Cooperation with organisations or third countries relates in particular to:      the relations between the Agency and the third party;       provisions for consultation on subjects related to the Agency’s work;       security matters.       Context      The European Defence Agency was established on the basis of Article       42      , Paragraph 3, of the Treaty on European Union. Its missions are detailed in Article       45      of the TEU. The European Agency constitutes a fundamental element of the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy. It offers a legal and institutional framework for cooperation between the Member States in the field of defence.

   EU-Pacific strategy     EU-Pacific strategy     This Communication is the first formal strategy in thirty years for EU-Pacific relations. It aims to strengthen political dialogue, place greater focus on development cooperation and improve the effectiveness of aid delivery. It reflects the growing environmental, political and economic importance of the Pacific region.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee of 29 May 2006 - EU relations with the Pacific Islands - A strategy for a strengthened partnership [       COM(2006) 248      – Official Journal C 184 of 8 August 2006].     SUMMARY     The strategy will bring the EU's relationship with the Pacific into line with the new EU development policy statement adopted by the EU institutions in December 2005 and with the revised       Cotonou Agreement      of 2005. It will also help put into practice the EU's commitments to aid effectiveness in the region.     The strategy consists of three components:      stronger political relations on matters of common interest such as global political security, trade, economic and social development and the environment;       more focused development action, with greater emphasis on regional cooperation to build up critical mass, enhance regional governance and facilitate mutual enrichment;       more efficient aid delivery, including greater use of direct budget support and closer coordination with other partners, in particular Australia and New Zealand.      In this strategy, the EU concentrates on sound management and protection of the environment, which are essential to the prosperity of the Pacific region, and takes into account its specific character: some of the islands are small, remote and vulnerable to natural disasters; they also face the challenges of state fragility and weak governance; moreover, their political and economic importance has increased owing to a growing demand for their substantial natural resources (fish, timber, minerals, oil, gas).     As regards strengthening the political dialogue between the EU and the Pacific region, the proposal is to increase contact with the Pacific Islands Forum, which is the main regional institution for political issues. It is also important to conduct a dialogue at national level with key Pacific ACP countries, in accordance with the Cotonou Agreement.      More focused development action      The action will focus on three priorities: governance, regionalism and sustainable management of natural resources.     Drawing on its experience, the EU will help prevention and stabilisation in post-conflict situations and establish good governance by strengthening credible institutions. It will encourage greater compliance with international standards as regards workers and in the fight against corruption, money laundering and terrorist financing.     Regional integration is crucial for an effective development aid strategy. The Pacific needs to strengthen this dimension and the EU will bring added value where it can. It will continue to help the Forum Secretariat and the other       Council of Regional Organisations in the Pacific      (CROP) agencies, in particular as regards natural resources management, vulnerability and governance.     The EPA (Economic Partnership Agreement) has a catalytic effect on economic cooperation and integration in the Pacific region as it stimulates the Pacific ACP countries to negotiate as a group, open up to each other and improve regional governance. Of the Pacific ACP countries’ total exports, 10 % go to the EU. This is a remarkable figure considering the size of these countries and the physical distance between the Pacific and Europe. In order to maximise the benefits of the EPA, the negotiations are closely coordinated with the programming and implementation of development assistance.     The Commission proposes that the central theme for strengthened cooperation be “blue-green”: that it deal therefore with sustainable management of natural resources and that it support Pacific ACP countries in their action to cope with environmental problems and resource-management issues. This is an area where Europe could contribute with its clearly recognised added value and where it could offer its collective experience and know-how.     The EU can assist these countries in managing their ocean and coastal resources in a sustainable manner through initiatives that could combine the use and conservation of fisheries and marine biodiversity. The new generations of       Fisheries Partnership Agreements      (FPAs) are an important milestone. They provide regulated access to fishing opportunities for European vessels and envisage close cooperation to promote responsible fishing and ensure conservation and sustainable use of the fishery resources of the partner countries concerned.     To make EU development assistance more efficient, the Commission proposes that assistance should be more concentrated, with a stronger focus at regional level, more efficient use of small-country allocations and greater use of budget support. The proposed concentration will facilitate donor coordination and avoid overlap or inconsistencies between those seeking to achieve common goals.     With a view to a more systematic application of the budget support instrument in its cooperation with the Pacific ACP countries, the EU plans to enter into a dialogue with the International Monetary Fund (the IMF) in order to share analyses, experience and studies.     Furthermore, the EU will proactively assist these countries in meeting the eligibility criteria for budget support, i.e.:      a poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) or a national development strategy under preparation;       a stable macroeconomic framework which is either satisfactory or under reform;       transparent and sound public finance management.      RELATED ACTS      Proposal for a Council Decision of 16 December 2008 on the signature and provisional application of the Interim Partnership Agreement between the European Community, of the one part, and the Pacific States, of the other part [         COM(2008) 858        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      The European Union and the Pacific States have agreed on the provisional application of the interim agreement providing for the establishment of an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA).     In 2007 the regime of safeguard clauses concerning trade measures contained in the Cotonou Agreement expired as did the World Trade Organization (WTO) waiver covering that regime. In this context, the provisional application of this agreement aims at ensuring the stability of trade between the EU and the signatory States from the Pacific region.     The EPA mainly concerns trade in goods. It lays down the measures necessary to establish a free trade area and deals with questions concerning customs, the facilitation of trade, dispute settlement, the removal of technical barriers, and sanitary and phytosanitary measures.     The agreement provides for the addition of new fields of cooperation when negotiations concerning the adoption of an enlarged EPA take place - in particular cooperation in development, fisheries, services and agriculture.

summary of   European platform against poverty and social exclusion — COM(2010) 758 final   summary    what does this communication do  It establishes the European platform against poverty and social exclusion, one of the key initiatives of the  Europe 2020 strategy  for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. It sets out how different policies and specific actions can contribute to the target of lifting at least 20 million people out of poverty and social exclusion by 2020.   key points    Objectives   The Platform is designed to create a partnership between different groupings in society including national governments, EU institutions, regional and local authorities, NGOs and persons who are themselves in poverty.  Their partnership is aimed at developing EU-wide approaches in all areas relating to  social inclusion  , particularly:        —      access to employment  , by assessing national inclusion strategies and European strategy to  develop jobs and workers’ skills             —      access to basic services and social protection  , particularly in the context of ageing populations and the increase in social exclusion            —      education and youth  , to reduce  early school leaving  and inequalities in education            —      economic and social integration of migrants  , through a new  European strategy             —      tackling discrimination  , especially against minorities, persons with  disabilities  and the homeless, but also improving financial independence and  gender equality  .            —      access to information and communication technologies  , network services, as well as financial (basic banking) and energy services (lighting and heating).       5 areas of action  :        1.     Action to fight poverty across all policies areas but particularly the labour market, minimum income support,  healthcare  , education and  housing  .            2.     Better use of EU funds, including  Structural Funds  , to support social inclusion.            3.     Extensive testing and assessment of what does and does not work in  social policy innovations  (methods and instruments used to address social issues) before implementing them more widely.            4.     Working in  partnership with NGOs  and interest groups to support more effectively the implementation of social policy reforms.            5.     Improving policy coordination among EU countries through the use of the  open method of coordination for social protection and social inclusion  (Social OMC) and the  Social Protection Committee  in particular.       Key action   All EU countries have established  national targets and policies for growth  with the Europe 2020 strategy targets in mind. The Commission monitors these reforms through a yearly cycle of economic policy coordination called the  European Semester  . It then provides recommendations for the next 12-18 months.  Progress in the 5 areas of action is recorded on  scoreboards  . As of July 2013,  23 of 64 Commission initiatives  had been  completed  . These include:        —     a Commission recommendation to EU countries on  simplifying banking services  and            —     a Council recommendation on policies to  combat early school leaving  .       Ongoing action  includes launching a  European innovation partnership on active and healthy ageing  and ensuring that the objectives of poverty reduction and social inclusion are maintained in  Horizon 2020  , the 2014-2020 research and innovation framework programme.   background    European platform against poverty and social exclusion  .   act   Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions – The European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion: A European framework for social and territorial cohesion (  COM(2010) 758 final  of 16.12.2010)
summary of   Communication (COM(2008) 394 final) – ‘Think Small First’ - A ‘Small Business Act’ for Europe   The Envoy for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) acts as the interface between the  European Commission  and the SME community and plays a dual role, simultaneously acting within the Commission and interacting with the outside world. The Envoy listens to SMEs’ concerns and represents their interests in the EU’s law-making process. Not only does the Envoy give the Commission a human face in its dealings with European SMEs, including start-ups and scale-ups, but also stresses their importance for economic growth and job creation in Europe.  The competitiveness of the European Union (EU) is fundamentally dependent on the wellbeing of its SMEs. The EU’s 23 million SMEs make up 99 % of all EU companies and account for the majority of new jobs created. SMEs are thus an essential source of growth, increased employment and better jobs in the European economy, which are key aims of the Lisbon strategy.  Although they are affected by many EU policies, it is difficult for SMEs to make their opinions heard.  In order to give them an opportunity to express themselves, and so as to implement in practice the ‘Think Small First’ principle set out in the European Charter for Small Enterprises adopted by the Santa Maria de Feira European Council in June 2000, the European Commission decided to appoint an SME Envoy.  Internally, the Envoy’s role is to improve the Commission's awareness of the problems facing SMEs. The Envoy examines EU polices that could have an impact on SMEs and ensures that their interests and specific needs are taken into account during policy-making.  The Envoy's task is part of the impact assessment system intended to ensure that the Commission’s proposals are subject to prior evaluation of their economic, environmental and social effects. The key contribution of the SME Envoy is to argue SMEs’ case at an early stage of the law-making process and thus anticipate the effects of new laws.  In this way, the Envoy’s work increases coordination within the Commission on issues concerning SMEs.  Externally, the Envoy is a visible contact person who is recognised by the SME community. The Envoy’s role is to listen, by means of direct contact, both regular and informal, with SMEs and their representative organisations. Besides gathering information, the Envoy keeps SMEs informed on EU programmes and funding and can answer their questions directly. By establishing dialogue between the EU and European business, the Envoy contributes to improving governance in Europe.  The first SME Envoy was nominated in 2001.  The current EU SME Envoy is Ms Elżbieta Bieńkowska, Member of the European Commission for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs.   background   For more information, see:   ‘SME Envoys Network’  on the European Commission's website.
act   Directive  2006/87/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 laying down technical requirements for inland waterway vessels and repealing Council Directive  82/714/EEC  .   summary   The coexistence of various technical regulations on navigable waterways in the Community has long obstructed the free movement of vessels.  This Directive is designed to strengthen the harmonisation of the requirements for issuing navigation certificates by the Member States.   Scope of application   The Directive applies to vessels of a length of 20 metres or more and a volume of at least 100 m3. It also applies to floating equipment, tugs and pushers, and vessels intended for passenger transport carrying more than 12 passengers in addition to the crew. Ferries, naval vessels and warships are excluded from its scope of application.   Waterways   The Community waterways concerned are classified in four navigable zones plus a zone R – the Rhine – which is covered by a special convention. Any Member State may change the classification of its waterways, subject to their being notified to the Commission at least six months in advance.   Derogations   Exceptions are allowed: any Member State may, after consulting the Commission, authorise a reduction of the technical requirements of Annex II for craft operating exclusively in certain zones.  Derogations are also possible in the case of vessels operating on waterways not linked to the waterways of another Member State or making limited journeys of local interest or in harbour areas. However, the Member States may also, under certain conditions, lay down additional technical requirements for vessels operating on their waterways.   Certificates   Craft operating on Community waterways must also carry a Community certificate. Where they operate in zone R, they must have either a Community certificate or a certificate issued in accordance with the Revised Convention for Rhine Navigation. Community certificates are to be issued for craft laid down from 30 December 2008 onwards, following a technical inspection carried out prior to the craft being put into service and intended to check whether it complies with the technical requirements laid down in Annex II to the Directive. If the competent authorities find any infringements of the requirements, the craft may, provided that it does not constitute a manifest danger, continue to operate until such time as the non-compliant components or areas of the craft are replaced or altered. After that, the components or areas must meet the requirements of Annex II.  Community certificates may be issued by the competent authorities of any Member State. It must draw up a list of its competent authorities and notify them to the Commission.   Implementing powers   Directive 2006/137/EC adapts Directive  2006/87/EC  to bring it into line with Council Decision  1999/468/EC  laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission. Directive 2006/87/EC empowers the Commission to update the technical requirements in the Annexes to Directive 2006/87/EC.   Transport of dangerous goods   Directive  2008/68/EC  repeals Article 6 of Directive 2006/87/EC on the transport of dangerous goods, and establishes common rules for all aspects of inland transport, including inland navigation.

summary   This Directive establishes a framework for labelling and consumer information regarding energy consumption for energy-related products .   Which products are concerned?   The Directive shall apply to products which are likely to have a direct or indirect impact on the consumption of energy and on other potential resources during use. It does not apply to:   second-hand products;   any means of transport for persons or goods;   product rating plates.   Furthermore, Directive 2012/27/EU, amending Directive 2010/30/EU, establishes a common framework to promote energy efficiency in the Union. The Member States are therefore encouraged to implement cumulative energy efficiency measures rather than energy efficiency measures for each individual product.   What sort of information must be provided?   Suppliers shall place on the market products that have a label containing information on the product’s consumption of electric energy or other forms of energy.  Suppliers must also make available technical documentation including:   a general description of the product;   the results of design calculations carried out;   test reports;   the references allowing identification of similar models.   The technical documentation must be available for a period of five years.  Suppliers shall provide dealers with labels and product information free of charge.  Dealers must affix labels in such a way that they are visible and legible.   What are the conditions for distance selling?   In some situations, the final consumer does not see the product – in particular when purchasing by mail order, by catalogue or through the Internet. However, the consumer must have access to product information through delegated acts which specify the way in which the label or the fiche is displayed or provided to the end-user.   What is the function of delegated acts?   A delegated act shall indicate in particular:   a description of the product;   measurement standards and methods;   details of the technical documentation;   the design and content of the label. The classification of the product on the label shall be indicated using the letters A to G. The most efficient class shall be represented by A+++.

   Air fares and air cargo rates (third phase)     Air fares and air cargo rates (third phase)     This regulation sets out to liberalize price formation for Community air services.     ACT     Council Regulation (EEC) No       2409/92      of 23 July 1992 on passenger fares and air cargo rates [Official Journal L 240 of 24.08.1992].     SUMMARY     This Regulation repeals Council Regulation (EEC) No       2342/90      .     The Regulation applies to the criteria and procedures governing establishment of the air fares and air cargo rates charged by air carriers on air services within the Community.     Member States may not withhold approval of fares and rates charged by Community carriers if the fares and rates are reasonably related to the applicant carrier's total costs. If they withhold approval, Member States must also take into account other factors such as consumers' needs, the competitive situation in the market and the need to prevent dumping. The fact that a proposed air fare is lower than that offered by another carrier is not sufficient reason for withholding approval. Air carriers may not charge fares or rates that are so excessively high as to disadvantage users or so low as to be unjustifiable.     Air fares offered to tour operators or the public and specifically combined with accommodation arrangements for the duration of the trip, and air fares for groups larger than six persons, will receive automatic approval.     Cargo rates may be set by free agreement between the parties to the contract of carriage.     Air carriers must submit their proposed air fares for scheduled air services in the form prescribed by the Member State concerned. An air fare for a scheduled air service will be considered as approved unless, within 30 days of submission, the Member State(s) concerned has (have) notified disapproval to the applicant carriers in writing, giving reasons.     Member States have one month to refer the Commission's decision to the Council.     A Member State may permit a Community air carrier to match an air fare already approved for a scheduled air service between the same pair of cities, it being understood that this does not apply to indirect air services which exceed by more than 40 % the length of the shortest direct service.     For a scheduled air service where competition is limited, a Member State whose interests are involved may request the Commission to examine whether an air fare complies with the conditions described in point 2 above.     Competition will be taken to be limited where:      there are significant barriers to market entry;       there are public service obligations;       at most 30 000 seats are offered for sale per year in that Member State by a single air carrier.      The Commission has two months to issue its decision on whether the air fare complies with the conditions.     The Commission may investigate on its own initiative whether an air fare conforms to the provisions of the Regulation. Any Member State whose interests are involved has one month to refer the resulting Commission decision to the Council. The Commission is required to consult the representatives of air transport user organizations at least once a year on scheduled air fares.     Air carriers from third countries with traffic rights between Community airports are permitted to match the normal economy air fare or its closest equivalent, unless otherwise provided in an agreement between the Community and the third country.     In order to carry out its duties under this Regulation the Commission may obtain all necessary information. Where the information supplied is incomplete or incorrect the Commission may impose a fine of 1 000 to 50 000 euros. Also, where air carriers infringe the provisions of this Regulation, a fine of up to 10 % of annual turnover may be imposed. The decision may be referred for review by the Court of Justice that may cancel, reduce or increase the fine.      Context      Since 1 November 2008, Regulation (EC) No 2409/92 has been repealed and replaced by Regulation (EC) No       1008/2008      establishing common rules for the operation of air services in the Community. In particular, this Regulation introduces new rules on passenger fares and prices for the carriage of cargo.

summary of   Regulation (EU) 2020/493 on the false and authentic documents online (FADO) system   what is the aim of the regulation   It repeals Council Joint Action  98/700/JHA  (see  summary  ) which originally established the European image archiving system on false and authentic documents online (FADO).   It sets out a new legal basis for the FADO system, updating its management system by adapting it to the new institutional base set out in  Article 87(2)(a)  of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.   key points    The false and authentic documents online system    The FADO system contains information on authentic documents issued by EU countries, the EU and third parties (such as non-EU countries, territorial entities, international organisations and other entities subject to international law) and on false versions of those documents.   It aims to contribute to the fight against document and identity fraud by:   sharing information on the security features of, and potential fraud characteristics in, authentic and false documents between the EU countries’ authorities competent in the area of document fraud;   sharing information with other actors, including the general public.      Scope    The FADO system contains information on documents issued by EU countries or the EU. Documents include:   travel, identity, residence and civil status documents;   driving licences and vehicle licences.     It may also contain information on:   equivalent documents issued by third parties;   other related official documents, in particular those used in support of applications for official documents, issued by EU countries and, where applicable, third parties.     The information to be included in the system includes:   information, including images, on authentic documents, specimens of those documents and their security features;   information, including images, on false documents, whether forged, counterfeit or pseudo documents, and their fraud characteristics;   summaries of forgery techniques;   summaries of the security features of authentic documents;   statistics on detected false documents.     The system may also contain handbooks, contact lists, information on valid travel documents and their recognition by EU countries, recommendations on effective ways of detecting specific methods of falsification and other useful related information.   The EU countries, the EU and third parties must submit this information to the  European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex)  set up by Regulation (EU)  2019/1896  — see  summary  . Technical support for Frontex can be provided by eu-LISA, which was set up by Regulation (EU)  2018/1726  — see  summary  .    Access   The FADO system provides users with different levels of access to information:   The  European Commission  and Frontex, to the extent necessary for the performance of their tasks, and relevant national authorities, such as police, border guard and other law enforcement authorities, have secure access to the FADO system on a need-to-know basis.   The general public has access to specimens of authentic documents or authentic documents with pseudonymous data.   Other actors can gain access to information stored in the FADO system in a limited manner:   other EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, including Europol, which was set up by Regulation (EU)  2016/794  — see  summary  ;   third parties, such as non-EU countries, territorial entities, international organisations and other entities subject to international law;   private entities, such as airlines and other carriers.     Personal data is protected by Regulation (EU)  2016/679  — see  summary  :   use of data by police and judicial authorities is specifically protected by Directive (EU)  2016/680  — see  summary  .   Frontex must apply the rules set out in Regulation (EU)  2018/1725  — see  summary  .     from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 26 April 2020.   background   The regulation builds upon the  Schengen   acquis  which, on the basis of protocols attached to the Lisbon Treaty, certain EU countries can opt in or out of.    Denmark  did not take part in the adoption of the regulation and is therefore not bound by it nor subject to its application. It can however decide to opt in within a period of 6 months after the regulation takes effect.    Ireland  , a non-member of the Schengen-zone, has chosen to take part.   The agreement applies additionally to  Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland  .
   Towards a European Strategic Energy Technology Plan     Towards a European Strategic Energy Technology Plan     Developing clean, efficient and low-carbon energy technologies is essential if the European Union is to face up to today's energy and environmental challenges and set an example for other countries. It is with these aims in mind that the European Commission announces the launch of a European Strategic Energy Technology (SET) plan.     ACT     Commission Communication of 10 January 2007: "Towards a European Strategic Energy Technology Plan" [       COM(2006) 847      final - Not published in the Official Journal]     SUMMARY     The European Union (EU) - just like the rest of the world - is faced with major challenges as regards energy and the environment: these include ever-increasing global demand for energy, volatile prices, rising emissions of the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change, and unstable oil and gas supplies, with reserves concentrated in just a few countries.     Urgent efforts are required if we are to prevent the worldwide energy situation from getting even worse.     Developing new energy technologies can play a decisive role here and help to achieve the EU's goals of reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by 20% between now and 2020 and increasing by 20% the share of renewable sources in Europe's energy mix.     The EU therefore intends to adopt a European Strategic Energy Technology (SET) plan to speed up the development of clean, efficient and low-carbon technologies.      The vital role of energy technologies      Energy technologies have a key role to play in providing energy that is at once competitive and sustainable.     Technology can bring substantial advances for energy efficiency, the use of renewable energy sources, the reduced use of fossil fuels, the gradual decarbonisation of transport and power stations, and the use of nuclear power. Also, information and communication technologies can help in managing and reducing energy demand.     Energy technologies therefore not only play a part in ensuring secure, sustainable supplies at reasonable prices, but also contribute to growth and jobs in Europe.     European-level research has already delivered results in this field - in increasing the output and lowering the costs of wind and photovoltaic energy, for example. European Technology Platforms have also been set up in order to coordinate efforts. Financial backing for research and demonstration will be provided under the       Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technical Development      , with a 50% increase in annual spending on energy research, and under the "       Intelligent Energy - Europe      " programme. More needs to be done, however.      A European Strategic Energy Technology (SET) plan      The SET plan will contribute to the development of a more sustainable energy system that is up to today's challenges.     The plan will build up a portfolio of more efficient, cleaner and more competitive energy technologies. It will establish stable and predictable conditions for the finance sector and for companies, especially SMEs, developing, providing backing for, and/or disseminating these technologies. It will also influence European citizens' socio-economic behaviour by encouraging better energy use.     The SET plan will help to drive the whole process of technological innovation from basic research through to commercial production. It will enable Community and national instruments to be used to the best possible effect, thus helping to accelerate technology development ("technology push"), in particular the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Development, and market introduction ("demand pull"), especially the "Intelligent Energy - Europe" programme.     The strategic element of the plan will be to identify those technologies for which it is essential to mobilise resources at European level in order to accelerate development and deployment. To achieve this in a targeted and coordinated way, the Commission proposes establishing firm partnerships, defining precise objectives and evaluating the associated risks and resources.      Drawing up the SET plan      The Commission intends to put forward a first European Strategic Energy Technology Plan at the Spring 2008 European Council, after consulting all stakeholders (industry, researchers, the finance sector, public authorities, energy consumers, civil society, unions).      Background      This communication is part of a package of measures setting out a       European energy policy      , as presented by the Commission on 10 January 2007.     Last updated: 03.05.2007  
   Communication on the future of the European Employment Strategy (2003)     Communication on the future of the European Employment Strategy (2003)     Presented by the Commission as a document for discussion with a view to revising the EES in 2003, the purpose of this Communication is to present an outline for the new employment strategy complemented by examples of existing concrete objectives and considerations and suggestions for possible new targets. It introduces a new generation of guidelines. A subsequent revision is envisaged in 2005 in the framework of revising the Lisbon Strategy.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, of 14 January 2003, on the future of the European Employment Strategy (EES) "A strategy for full employment and better jobs for all" [       COM (2003) 6      final - not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This communication supplements the       five-year review      of the European Employment Strategy (EES). Given that the EES constitutes a key component of the       Lisbon agenda      , the Commission stresses that it will contribute to responding to medium and longer term challenges which the European Union will have to face, notably via a       new generation of employment guidelines      .     The core of the Commission's recommendations consists in a simplification of the guidelines, the definition of quantified targets, better coordination of policies and mobilisation of the different players involved in implementing the EES.     Hence, the new guidelines should include three overall objectives:       full employment        by raising the employment rate overall (67% in 2005 and 70% in 2010 on average for the EU), for women (respectively 57% and 60%) and for older workers (50% in 2010);        quality and productivity at work        : closely correlated, quality includes in particular satisfaction with pay and working conditions, health and safety at the work place, the availability of flexible work organisation, working time arrangements and the balance between flexibility and security;        cohesion and an inclusive labour market        for all persons wanting to work (23 million jobseekers in 2001; the employment rate of the 38 million disabled does not reach 40%).      In order to achieve these overall targets, the Commission proposes:       introducing or reinforcing active and preventive measures        for the unemployed and the inactive by making the right offer to the right person at the right time, by early identification of the needs of each jobseeker and by a personalised action plan with a view to sustainable integration. Particular attention should be paid to youth unemployment and long-term unemployment;        making work pay        by reviewing the tax/benefit systems with a view to eliminating unemployment and poverty traps, encouraging women to enter, remain in or reintegrate into the labour market and retaining older workers longer in employment;       fostering entrepreneurship to create more and better jobs notably by improving awareness of entrepreneurship as a career option mainly among the unemployed, women, young people and inactive persons, as well as by reducing barriers to the hiring of staff, especially in small firms;        transforming undeclared work into regular employment        by increasing awareness as to the negative effects of undeclared work, simplifying procedures and legislation, lowering the tax burden on labour, effective surveillance and sanctions;        promoting active ageing        to keep workers longer in employment notably by improving quality in work;        developing and reinforcing immigration policy        with a view to the successful integration of migrants;        promoting adaptability in the labour market        , via different contractual or working time arrangements, by encouraging access to training and by negotiations between the social partners;        promotion of investment in human capital and strategies for lifelong learning        by re-directing public expenditure so as to increase efficiency in these areas, by raising the level of education and by closer involvement of companies in adult education;        promoting gender equality        by conducting systematic gender impact assessment for new policy proposals, by increasing female participation in key areas such as higher education and research, by promoting structures which enable women to keep their jobs, such as childcare facilities;        supporting integration and combating discrimination        in the labour market for people at a disadvantage, for example because of illness, ethnic origin, family situation, age, place of residence, etc.;        addressing regional employment disparities        via a targeted policy focusing on the quality of human resources, investment in skills, education and lifelong learning and partnerships at local and regional level to promote job creation and address skill gaps.      Examples of indicators and quantified targets for the EES are provided in the annex to this Communication.     The operational services that play a particularly important role in implementing the objectives are the employment services, the social re-integration services, the training services and the labour inspectorates. Invited to present an annual report on their contributions at European, national, regional and local level, the social partners have also been closely involved in implementing the EES.     The Berlin European Council of 1999 established the European Social Fund (ESF) as a key financial instrument to support the EES, but it is necessary to take account of trends in regional and national labour markets when implementing the Structural Fund programmes.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 295/2008 concerning structural business statistics   what is the aim of the regulation  It seeks to ensure that high-quality structural business statistics (SBSs) are collected, compiled and transmitted by European Union (EU) countries to  Eurostat  according to agreed standards and formats.   key points    What are SBSs?   SBSs describe the structure, main characteristics and performance of businesses and are a vital tool for policymakers, as well as for assisting in business decision-making.   Why have SBSs?   Comparable, reliable, thorough and timely statistics are vital for effective policymaking. SBSs provide a basis from which to  analyse the performance of various economic activities and sectors  . They are becoming an increasingly important component in checking the effectiveness of policies in areas such as the EU’s internal market and the implementation of the  Europe 2020 strategy  .   What do SBSs cover?   Aspects covered include:    structure and evolution of the activities ofbusinesses  (manufacturing, construction, distribution and services, but not, for example, agriculture, forestry or fishing and public administration);    factors of production used  (labour, capital, etc.) and other elements that allow business activity, competitiveness and performance to be measured;    regional, national, EU and international development of businesses and markets  — useful for understanding specific sectors and comparing activity and performance across markets;    business conduct  in relation to, for example, research and development, environmental protection and investment; and    small and medium-sized enterprises  (e.g. for the evaluation of entrepreneurship).    Collection and transmission of SBSs   Each year, EU countries must send to Eurostat a number of  ‘data sets’  (by company size, region, etc.) collected by national statistical institutes. These are compiled using the  NACE  classification, the nomenclature of economic activities in the European Union. The  quality  of the data is checked before it is published (free of charge) on Eurostat’s website.   How are SBSs used?   SBSs provide information on:   the wealth created by each activity, broken down by employee, and productivity;   trends in the structure of business sectors;   activities in which countries/regions specialise, and how these are structured in different markets.    Compliance   A 2014 Commission  report  concludes that compliance with the law is ‘very good’ or ‘good’ for most EU countries.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 29 April 2008.   background   For more information, see:   ‘  Structural business statistics introduced  ’ on Eurostat's website.
   Development of the Community's railways     Development of the Community's railways     This directive recognises the need for a greater integration of the European railway system into an increasingly competitive market. The directive also makes the important distinction between the provision of transport services and the operation of infrastructure, identifying the need for these two areas to be managed separately in order to facilitate the future development and efficiency of the Community’s railways.     ACT     Council Directive       91/440/EEC      of 29 July 1991 on the development of the Community's railways [       See amending act(s)      ].     SUMMARY     The directive applies to the       management of railway infrastructure      and to the       rail transport activities of the railway undertakings      established or to be established in the Community, with the exception of railway undertakings whose activity is limited to the provision of solely urban, suburban or regional services.      Management independence      European Union (EU) countries must take the appropriate measures to ensure that railway undertakings are       independent      with regards management, administration and internal control over administrative, economic and accounting matters, thereby holding assets, budgets and accounts separate from those belonging to the State.     EU countries must also take the necessary action to enable railway undertakings to       adapt their activities to the market      and allow their own management bodies to be responsible for the management of their activities, thereby efficiently providing the required quality of service at the lowest possible cost.      Separation between infrastructure management and transport operations      EU countries must ensure the separation of infrastructure management and transport operations by keeping separate profit and loss accounts and balance sheets and publishing them individually for business relating to the provision of transport services by railways undertakings and for business relating to the management of railway infrastructure. Public funds must also reflect this separation and those paid to one activity must not be transferred to the other.     Individual EU countries will be responsible for the development of their national railway infrastructure but they must bear in mind, where necessary, the general needs of the Community.      Access to railway infrastructure      The railway undertakings concerned by this directive will be accorded access to the infrastructure in all other EU countries for the operation of all rail freight services and international passenger services.      Monitoring tasks of the Commission      The Commission will monitor the       technical and economic conditions and market developments      of the European rail transport, working closely with representatives both from EU countries and from the relevant sectors to better assess the efficiency and impact of the adopted measures.

   Adapting to Climate Change     Adapting to Climate Change     This Green Paper launches a consultation on the future direction of EU policy as regards Europe's adaptation to climate change. It states why action must be taken and lays down the relevant guidelines.     ACT     European Commission Green Paper of 29 June 2007 on adapting to climate change in Europe - options for EU action [       COM(2007) 354      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     In this Green Paper, the Commission provides a broad outline of Community action to be taken for the EU's adaptation to climate change and raises a number of questions so that stakeholders may determine whether they find the Commission's proposed direction satisfactory, make known their wishes regarding the EU's priorities, and perhaps provide new ideas. The Commission will use any contributions and responses to the Green Paper, which must be submitted before 30 November 2007, to determine its future action.     EU policy aims to mitigate the impact of climate change by limiting the global average temperature increase to 2°C compared with pre-industrial levels. This requires a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, as announced in the       EU strategy on climate change      and as decided by the European Council in March 2007.      Europe's need to adapt      A certain degree of climate change is however inevitable, with significant impacts owing to increased temperatures and rainfall, water scarcity and more frequent storms. Therefore, for these impacts to be dealt with, mitigation measures must be complemented by adaptation efforts. Adaptation must revolve as much around current changes as around future and anticipated changes.     Among the effects of global climate change, the Green Paper cites in particular drought, floods, reduced access to safe drinking water, loss of biodiversity, degradation of ecosystems, a higher risk of famine, population displacements owing to a rise in sea level in the deltas, as well as the health impact of more frequent extreme weather events and illnesses dependent on climatic conditions.     In Europe, the average temperature has risen by almost 1°C in the last century, which has already led to changes in precipitation rates - while some regions are getting more rain and snow, others are experiencing more frequent periods of drought. The most vulnerable areas are southern Europe and the Mediterranean Basin, mountain areas, coastal zones, densely populated floodplains, Scandinavia and the Arctic region.     Climate change will also severely affect economic sectors that are dependent on climatic conditions, namely agriculture, forestry, fisheries, beach and mountain tourism, and the health, financial services and insurance sectors. The energy sector and energy consumption will also be affected, mainly because there will be less water available for supplying hydroelectric dams and for cooling thermal and nuclear power plants in regions that will suffer from higher temperatures and lower levels of precipitation and snow cover, and also because of the risks faced by energy infrastructure owing to storms, floods and the increased demand for electricity for air-conditioning.     Swift action to adapt the EU to climate change will prove to be much less costly than the damage resulting from this phenomenon. The       Stern Review      and the results of studies such as those conducted for the       PESETA Project      under the European Commission's Joint Research Centre all point to this fact. Adaptation must therefore start at once for impacts whose forecasts are sufficiently reliable.     Everyone, from ordinary citizens to decision makers, both in the private and public sectors, can play a role in adaptation measures. Action should be taken at the most appropriate level and be complementary, especially between public authorities. For example, at national level special attention could be paid to improving disaster and crisis management - in particular risk prevention (by mapping vulnerable areas) and swift response in the event of a disaster - and to developing adaptation strategies. At regional level, spatial planning is important for adapting to climate change, while at local level efforts should focus on practical land use and land management techniques and on raising awareness. However, each Member State divides its responsibilities differently and it is therefore difficult to generalise these examples.     At EU level there is the advantage of an integrated and coordinated approach, involving numerous policies on which the EU has considerable influence, which will make it possible to deal with cross-border effects.      Adaptation: the EU takes action      There are four pillars of action that can be taken on a Community scale: early action in the EU provided sufficient knowledge has been acquired, integrating adaptation into EU external relations, improving knowledge where there are gaps and involving all stakeholders in the preparation of adaptation strategies.     As regards the first pillar, early action should be taken to integrate climate change adaptation into legislation and a number of policies. Integration will revolve around sectors that are or will be severely affected by climate change, such as agriculture, forestry, transport, health, water, fisheries, ecosystems and biodiversity, as well as around cross-cutting issues such as impact assessments and civil protection. At the same time, adaptation will create new technological and development opportunities in industry, services and energy technologies.     Early action to integrate adaptation into Community funding programmes and Community-funded projects is equally possible, particularly where infrastructure projects are concerned. This applies to programmes and projects adopted under the Cohesion Fund, the       European Regional Development Fund      , the       European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development      , the       European Social Fund      , the       European Fisheries Fund      and       LIFE+      , among others.     New policy responses can also be implemented at once. For example, by 2009 the Commission wishes to undertake a systematic check of how climate change is going to affect all Community policy areas and legislation and to follow up with further concrete action. Prospects for technological development associated with adaptation should be examined in close cooperation with the private sector. Additional funding will be required in the future for repairing climate-related damage, for which the insurance and financial services sectors must find innovative solutions.     As regards the second pillar, the Commission believes that the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy has an important role to play, as do bilateral and multilateral relations despite the different situations faced by partner countries. Developing countries are very vulnerable and the poorest countries will be hardest hit. It is therefore up to developed countries - given that they are historically responsible for most of the greenhouse gases accumulated in the atmosphere - to support their adaptation by sharing experience, and by using strategies for poverty reduction, planning, budgeting and existing partnerships. This support could be provided in the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the       EU Action Plan on Climate Change and Development      and the Global Climate Change Alliance.     Greater cooperation and dialogue should be sought with neighbouring countries, particularly in the context of the European Neighbourhood Policy, and with industrialised countries that are facing similar problems to those of the EU. Lastly, trade in sustainable goods and services, and especially environmental technologies, should also be developed.     As regards the third pillar, the Commission believes that if an integrated, cross-sectoral and holistic approach to research is adopted, then uncertainties concerning the accuracy of forecasts, the impacts of climate change and the cost and benefits of adaptation measures can be reduced. The Commission recommends that the research agenda should focus on developing comprehensive and integrated methodologies, indicators and long-term models, improving predictions on a regional and local scale and improving access to existing data, analysing in depth the impact that climate change has on ecosystems and their capacity to withstand such effects, promoting information systems and strengthening ties between European scientists and their counterparts abroad.     As regards the fourth pillar, the Commission believes that it is necessary to set up a structured dialogue with the parties and civil society concerned by Europe's need to adapt, especially those from sectors that are particularly affected by climate change. The Commission is considering the establishment of a European Advisory Group that would consist of decision makers, scientists and representatives of civil society organisations and would comment on the work of a number of working groups acting under the aegis of the Commission.

summary of   Council Decision 94/800/EC on the conclusion on behalf of the EU of the agreements reached in the Uruguay Round of multilateral negotiations (1986-1994) — aspects related to trade in goods    Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations (1986-1994) — Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation    Notice on the entry into force of the protocol amending the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation   what is the aim of the decision and of the agreement  On behalf of the European Community (today the European Union), the decision approves the agreement that established the  World Trade Organization (WTO)  .   key points    Final act embodying the results of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations    Through this decision, the Council adopted, on behalf of the European Community and with regard to matters within its competence, the results of the Uruguay Round of negotiations embodied in the  Marrakesh Final Act  signed in 1994 in Morocco by the representatives of the Community and its member countries.   The Marrakesh Final Act includes a list of multilateral and plurilateral agreements and ministerial decisions and declarations that clarify rules of certain agreements. The multilateral trade agreements and the associated legal instruments are binding for all WTO members. As far as the plurilateral agreements are concerned, although they form part of WTO law they do not create obligations or rights for WTO members that have not accepted them.   The agreement establishing the WTO incorporates several annexes containing the specific agreements;  Annex 1A  encompasses the  multilateral agreements on trade in goods  . These are:   the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994)  , which included the GATT 1947;   the Agreement on  Agriculture  ;   the Agreement on the  Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures  ;   the Agreement on  Textiles and Clothing  ;   the Agreement on  Technical Barriers to Trade  ;   the Agreement on  Trade-Related Investment Measures  ;   the Agreement on  Anti-Dumping Measures  ;   the Agreement on  Customs Valuation  ;   the Agreement on  Preshipment Inspection  ;   the Agreement on  Rules of Origin  ;   the Agreement on  Import Licensing Procedures  ;   the Agreement on  Subsidies and Countervailing Measures  ;   the Agreement on  Safeguards  .      Annex 1B  of the WTO Agreement contains the General Agreement on  Trade in Services (GATS)     Annex 1C  consists of the Agreement on  Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)  , including trade in counterfeit goods.    Annex 2  incorporates the  Understanding on rules and procedures governing the settlement of disputes  .    Annex 3  relates to the  Trade Policy Review Mechanism (TPRM)  of WTO members.   Lastly,  Annex 4  deals with the  plurilateral trade agreements  . These are:   the Agreement on  Trade in Civil Aircraft  ;   the Agreement on  Government Procurement  (revised in 2012);   the  International Dairy Agreement  (terminated in 1997);   the  International Bovine Meat Agreement  (terminated in 1997).      Agreement establishing the WTO    This agreement creates a permanent institutional framework for the specific agreements listed above.   The WTO is a permanent organisation that benefits from a legal personality. All members of the GATT became funding members of the WTO on 1 January 1995. Since then, applicants wishing to join have had to follow the accession procedure set out in the agreement establishing the WTO.   The WTO members have set the following objectives for the organisation:   raising standards of living;   ensuring full employment and a growing volume of real income and effective demand;   expanding the production of and trade in goods and services;   sustainable development and protection of the environment;   taking account of the needs of developing countries.     The functions of the WTO are to:   facilitate the implementation, administration and operation of the various trade agreements;   provide a forum for multilateral trade negotiations;   resolve trade disputes through the  Dispute Settlement Body (DSB)  ;   review the national trade policies of its members;   cooperate with other international organisations in order to ensure greater coherence in global economic policymaking.      Structure    The  Ministerial Conference  , is the highest decision-making body of the WTO. It is composed of representatives of all the member countries and meets at least once every 2 years. Between these meetings, the  General Council  , made up of representatives of all the members, takes decisions related to the functioning of the WTO and supervises the agreements and ministerial decisions. The General Council also meets to discharge the responsibilities of the DSB and the  Trade Policy Review Body  (TPRB) provided for in the TPRM (see below).   The General Council has 3 subsidiary bodies: the  Council for Trade in Goods  , the  Council for Trade in Services  and the  Council for Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  . In addition, there are several committees directly attached to the General Council. These include the Committees on  Trade and Development  , on  Trade and Environment  and  Regional Trade Agreements  . Lastly, 2 committees are responsible for managing the 2 plurilateral agreements on trade in civil aircraft and on government procurement.   The General Council appoints a  director-general  who is responsible for heading the  Secretariat  of the WTO.   In principle, the WTO takes its decisions by consensus. When a decision cannot be reached, decisions are taken by a majority of votes, each WTO member having one vote. The EU, which is a full member of the WTO, has a number of votes equal to the number of EU countries that are members of the WTO.   Each member of the WTO may submit proposals to the Ministerial Conference to amend provisions of the WTO’s various multilateral trade agreements.    Understanding on rules and procedures governing the settlement of disputes    The WTO’s dispute settlement system is an important element of the multilateral trading order. It is based on Articles XXII and XXIII of the GATT 1994 and on the rules and procedures subsequently drawn up and set out in the understanding on rules and procedures governing the settlement of disputes incorporated into the agreement establishing the WTO.   The dispute settlement system covers all of the multilateral trade agreements. In fact, it applies to  trade in goods  ,  trade in services  and  intellectual property issues  covered by the TRIPS agreement. It also applies to disputes under the plurilateral Agreement on Government Procurement. Some of these agreements contain rules concerning the settlement of disputes that only apply to disputes under the agreement in question and that may supplement or modify the rules of the understanding.   The dispute settlement system is administered by the DSB, set up by the understanding. All WTO members may attend the DSB’s meetings. However, where the DSB regulates the rules that relate to the settlement of disputes concerning a plurilateral trade agreement, only the members that are party to the agreement will be able to participate in decisions or actions taken by the DSB with respect to disputes under that agreement.   The dispute settlement process is launched when one member submits to another a request for consultations on a specific issue. These consultations must begin within 30 days of the request. If the consultations fail to settle a dispute, a member may call on the DSB to set up a panel, usually consisting of three independent experts, in order to deal with the issue. In addition, the parties may voluntarily agree to make use of other dispute settlement methods, including good offices, conciliation and mediation.   After listening to the parties, the panel submits a report to the DSB. The panel must complete its work within 6 months or, in cases of urgency, within 3 months. The report is considered for adoption by the DSB 20 days after it has been circulated to members. It is adopted within 60 days of the date of circulation unless the DSB decides by consensus not to adopt the report (opposite or negative consensus) or if one of the parties notifies its decision to appeal.   Indeed, the WTO’s dispute settlement procedure enables all parties to a panel case to appeal. The appeal is, however, limited to issues of law covered in the panel report and legal interpretations developed by the panel. The appeal is examined by a standing  Appellate Body  composed of 7 members appointed by the DSB for a 4-year term. Three of the members serve on any one case. The Appellate Body’s report must be accepted unconditionally by the parties of the dispute and adopted by the DSB unless there is a negative consensus. In other words, a decision by consensus not to adopt the report.   The DSB keeps the implementation of adopted recommendations or decisions under surveillance, and all pending matters remain on the agenda of its meetings until they are resolved. Deadlines are also set for the implementation of recommendations set out in panel reports. When a party is unable to implement these recommendations within a reasonable period of time, it must enter into negotiations with the complaining party with a view to developing mutually acceptable compensation. If these negotiations are unsuccessful, the DSB may authorise the complaining party to suspend the application of concessions or obligations to the member concerned. Compensation and the suspension of concessions are, however, only temporary measures that may be applied until the DSB’s recommendations are implemented by the member concerned.   In all cases, WTO members agree that they will not themselves determine whether there has been a violation of the obligations laid down within the framework of the WTO, nor suspend concessions. They must apply the rules and procedures for the settlement of disputes set out in the understanding.   Furthermore, the understanding on rules and procedures governing the settlement of disputes recognises the special situation of the WTO’s  developing country members  and  least-developed country members  . Developing countries may opt for an accelerated procedure, request extended deadlines or request additional legal aid. WTO members are encouraged to give particular consideration to the situation of developing country members.    Trade Policy Review Mechanism    The  TPRM  was set up as a temporary measure under the GATT in 1989 following the mid-term review of the Uruguay Round. This mechanism is now an integral part of the WTO system and encompasses all the fields covered by the WTO agreements (goods, services and intellectual property questions).   The TPRM in particular aims to achieve greater transparency in, and an understanding of, the trade policies and practices of WTO members, to encourage members to adhere to the rules in force in the multilateral trading system and, thus, to promote the smooth functioning of the system.   Within the framework of the TPRM, all WTO members are subject to review. This review is held every 2 years for the members with the greatest share of world trade (currently China, the EU, Japan and the United States), every 4 years for the next 16 members and every 6 years for the other members. A longer period may be set for least developed countries. In practice, a certain degree of flexibility has been introduced to the rate of reviews (up to a 6-month interval). In 1996, it was agreed that every other review of each of the first four trading powers would be an interim review.   The review is carried out by the TPRB on the basis of a general policy declaration submitted by the member concerned and on a report drawn up by the WTO Secretariat. In drawing up its report, the Secretariat seeks the support of the member concerned but retains full responsibility for the facts presented and views expressed. The Secretariat’s report and the member’s declaration are published following the review meeting, together with the minutes of the meeting and the text of the final comments made by the chairman of the TPRB at the end of the meeting.   from when do the decision and the agreement apply   The decision has applied since 22 December 1994.   The agreement has applied since 1 January 1995.   background   For more information, see the other summaries on the same decision and agreement on EUR-Lex:    Aspects relating to trade in services     Aspects relating to trade in goods     Aspects of intellectual property rights     Agreement on intellectual property rights relating to trade and pharmaceutical patents  and    ‘EU and WTO’  (European Commission).
summary of   Communication (COM(2016) 234 final) — Lives in Dignity: from Aid-dependence to Self-reliance   what is the aim of the communication  The aim is to provide a strategy for how the EU can best support  refugees and displaced people  in long-drawn-out situations such as the  Syrian crisis  , aiming to foster resilience  *  and self-reliance.   key points   The challenge of forced displacement calls for continuing action by the EU. This  European Commission  communication proposes a development approach to forced displacement based on improved evidence of what works and does not work. It aims to prevent displacement from becoming long-drawn-out, and to gradually end the dependence on humanitarian aid of those already displaced.   Changing emphasis   The policy builds on the EU’s strategy of  linking relief, rehabilitation and development (LRRD)  to develop a strategy integrating  humanitarian aid, development cooperation  and  political involvement  . Its elements include:    Early involvement of all actors.  Political and developmental actors should become involved in displacement crises at the outset, with the aim of improving living conditions and finding solutions to end displacement.    Strategies based on evidence  of what causes displacement and its consequences should be drawn up, leading to long-term protection and self-reliance, enhanced personal dignity, and reduced impact on host countries.    Turning strategies into programmes  coordinated with EU financial cycles. In addition, targets agreed between the EU and host countries should take into account unexpected influxes of displaced people without threatening local development or making local communities more fragile.    Regional cooperation.  There should be greater cooperation between countries facing common challenges. Academic and labour mobility, as well as stronger links between legislative bodies and business, trade unions and social partners should be encouraged.    Working with partner countries.  Legal registration for displaced populations should be promoted, progressively integrating them into the social and economic life of the community, and boosting engagement with local authorities.    Private sector involvement.  The private sector should be included in planning from the start of a crisis. Cooperation between the private and public sectors should be facilitated, including encouraging self-employment of displaced persons and help in restarting businesses.    Good quality education  is important for child protection and a top priority. There should be greater continuity between education in emergencies and public education, and host countries should be encouraged to use the potential of displaced education personnel.    Access to labour markets.  Helping host governments give displaced people access to labour markets and good jobs while protecting them from exploitation is key.    Access to services.  Helping host governments provide services such as housing, healthcare, security, justice and social protection for displaced persons is essential.   background   For more information, see:    ‘EU proposes new approach to better support displaced people through its external action’  on the European Commission's website.   * key terms     resilience:  the ability to recover from shocks or to adjust rapidly.
act    Directive 2014/68/EU  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to the making available on the market of pressure equipment   summary    what does this directive do  This European Union law lays down  essential safety requirements  for pressure equipment and assemblies (such as boilers, pressure cookers, fire extinguishers, heat exchangers and steam generators). All stationary pressure equipment must conform to strict specifications if it is to be sold in the EU.   key points    Scope   The directive applies to the design, manufacture and conformity of pressure equipment with a  maximum allowable pressure greater than 0.5 bar  . It covers all pressure equipment and assemblies that are new to the EU market, whether manufactured in the EU or elsewhere. This also includes imported used items.   Wide range of applications   Pressure equipment is used widely in industries such as:   oil,   chemicals,   plastics,   food,   glass,   paper,   energy production, storage and distribution.   Without stringent and effectively enforced standards, stationary pressure equipment can be inherently dangerous.   Responsibility for compliance   Manufacturers and their representatives, importers and distributors are responsible for the compliance of their products with this law. This is to ensure the health and safety of users and the safety of domestic animals and property, as well as to guarantee fair competition in the EU.   Manufacturer/importer details   Manufacturer details (name, registered trade name/trademark and their postal address) must be indicated on the equipment or, where this is not possible, on the packaging or in the accompanying documentation. These must be provided in a language easily understood by consumers and market surveillance authorities (public authorities that ensure products comply with legislation and are safe). Importers must provide their contact details.   Non-compliance   EU countries must ensure that manufacturers, importers and distributors comply with the law. If there is evidence of non-compliance, they must restrict or prohibit the equipment from being sold.   Annexes   These contain detailed information on aspects such as:   essential safety requirements to be met;   conformity assessment procedures (to test a product meets the required standards);   the EU declaration of conformity.   when does the directive apply  Rules in this field are currently governed by  Directive 97/23/EC  . Directive 2014/68/EU replaces Directive 97/23/EC with effect from 1 June 2015 (and 19 July 2016 for some aspects).   key terms    Pressure equipment:  vessels, piping, safety accessories and pressure accessories, including, where applicable, elements attached to pressurised parts, such as flanges, nozzles, couplings, supports and lifting lugs.   Assemblies:  several pieces of pressure equipment assembled by a manufacturer to constitute an integrated and functional whole.

summary of   Directive 2001/29/EC on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society   summary    what does the directive do  The directive aims to adapt legislation on copyright and related rights to technological developments and particularly to the  information society  , while providing for a high level of protection of intellectual property. In addition, it implements 2 international treaties that were concluded in December 1996: the  WIPO Copyright Treaty  and the  WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty  .  It is 1 of the 10 directives, including those on the  enforcement of intellectual property rights  ,  orphan works  , and the  collective management of copyright and related rights  , which together comprise the  EU’s copyright legislation  .   key points   The directive harmonises key rights granted to authors and neighbouring rightsholders (the  reproduction right  , the  right of communication to the public  and the  distribution right  ) and — to a lesser degree —  exceptions and limitations  to these rights. It also harmonises the protection of technological measures and of rights management information, sanctions and remedies.   Reproduction right   EU countries must provide for the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole or in part:   for authors, of the original and copies of their works;   for performers, of fixations* of their performances;   for phonogram producers, of their phonograms;   for the producers of the first fixation of films, in respect of the original and copies of their films;   for broadcasting organisations, of fixations of their broadcasts, whether those broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air (wireless), including by cable or satellite.    Right of communication to the public   EU countries must provide authors with the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit any communication to the public of their works. This includes making their works available to the public in such a way that members of the public may access them when and where they choose.  EU countries must also have rules on the exclusive right of making available:   for performers, of fixations of their performances;   for phonogram producers, of their phonograms;   for the producers of the first fixation of films, in respect of the original and copies of their films;   for broadcasting organisations, of fixations of their broadcasts — regardless of the method of transmission.    Distribution right    The directive establishes a single EU-wide rule to provide authors with the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit any distribution to the public of their works or copies thereof.   This distribution right is exhausted within the EU where the first sale or first other transfer of ownership in the EU of a work is made by the rightholder or with his consent.    Exceptions and limitations   The directive sets out an exhaustive list of exceptions and limitations to rights, in order to facilitate the use of protected content in specific circumstances.  There is a mandatory exception to the right of reproduction for certain temporary acts of reproduction which are integral and essential part of a technological process (temporary copies), and which aim to enable a lawful use or a transmission in a network between third parties by an intermediary, of a work or other subject-matter.   All the other exceptions and limitations relating to the rights of reproduction and communication are optional (EU countries may decide to implement them or not) and particularly concern the ‘public’ domain. For 3 of these exceptions —  reprography*, private use and broadcasts made by social institutions  — the rightsholders must receive fair compensation.   The exceptions and limitations to the distribution right are granted depending on the exceptions relating to reproduction or communication to the public.    Legal protection    EU countries must provide legal protection against the circumvention of any effective technological measures covering works or any other subject matter.   This legal protection also relates to ‘preparatory acts’ such as the manufacture, import, distribution, sale or provision of services for works with limited uses.    Protection of rights-management information   EU countries must provide legal protection against any person knowingly performing without authority any of the following acts:   the removal or alteration of any electronic rights-management information;   the distribution, broadcasting, communication or making available to the public of works or other protected subject matter from which electronic rights-management information has been removed.   from when does the directive apply  It applies from 22 June 2001. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 22 December 2002.   key terms   *  Fixation  : a work has to be embodied in a copy that allows it to be seen or copied by others (i.e. in a tangible medium such as a recording).  *  Reprography  : the science and practice of copying and reproducing documents and graphic material.   act   Directive  2001/29/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society (OJ L 167, 22.6.2001, pp. 10-19)  Successive amendments to Directive 2001/29/EC have been incorporated into the original text.

act    1257/2012  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2012 implementing enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection.   summary   The EU Regulation 1257/2012 on unitary patent protection (UPP) extends the European patent system, enabling an invention to be protected in all of the 25 participating Member States with just one application. The new patent could reduce patent translation and related costs by up to 80%, with a single annual renewal fee to the European Patent Office (EPO).  Patents to date in Europe have either been granted nationally or by the EPO. However, if a European patent is to be effective in a Member State, the patent holder must request validation in each country where patent protection is sought. Translation and annual renewal fees for these patents can be costly and are an overall burden for the EU.  As outlined in this regulation, the EU Patent aims to end the complexity and expense of the current European patent system. For example:   Holders of European patents can apply for the EU Patent for the territory of 25 Member States at the EPO. This patent will offer the  same level of protection  for their inventions in all those countries.   Patent applications can be submitted to the EPO  in any language  . However applicants will also have to provide a translation in one of the EPO's three official languages (English, French or German). Applicants can claim compensation if they are EU-based businesses, individuals, non-profit organisations, universities and public research bodies. The patent claims defining the scope of protection must be translated into the other two official languages of the EPO.   Lastly,  for a transitional period of no more than 12 years  , European patents with a unitary effect that were granted in French or German will need to be translated to English; those granted in English will need to be translated to another official language of the EU. These translations will be required until high-quality machine translations into all EU languages become available.    Enhanced cooperation   Both this regulation and  EU Regulation 1260/2012  on translation arrangements for UPP were adopted by 25 Member States under the enhanced cooperation* procedure. Non-participating Member States can join later.   Unified Patent Court   The patent reform package includes an  Agreement on a Unified Patent Court  . Established under an international agreement signed on 19 February 2013, this court will have specialised jurisdiction in patent disputes, thus avoiding costly multiple litigation in up to 28 different national courts.  * This allows EU Member States willing to work towards a common goal to do so outside of traditional Union collaboration, in this case through an intergovernmental treaty.

   Reinforcing the management of the EU's southern maritime borders     Reinforcing the management of the EU's southern maritime borders     This Communication sets out operational measures designed to combat illegal immigration, protect refugees and set up controls at, and surveillance of, the EU's external maritime borders. It proposes maximising the capacity of FRONTEX, establishing a Coastal Patrol Network, developing a European surveillance system, setting up expert teams to carry out an initial assessment of each person intercepted and maximising the use of Community financial resources.     ACT     Communication from the Commission: Reinforcing the management of the European Union's maritime borders [       COM(2006) 733      final - Not published in the Official Journal]     SUMMARY     This Communication sets out the Commission's main recommendations to improve the management of the southern maritime external borders.      Maximising the capacity of FRONTEX      The Commission recommends that:      Regulation (EC) No         377/2004        on the creation of the Immigration Liaison Officers' Network be amended to give         FRONTEX        access to the information gathered by liaison officers on a systematic basis and to allow for the participation of FRONTEX in their meetings;       the Member States be encouraged to pool technical equipment; FRONTEX should report on a regular basis to the Council and the Commission on achievements in this area.      It also proposes that FRONTEX:      examine the possibility of continuous joint control and surveillance operations at the external southern maritime borders, in particular during the period from spring till late autumn 2007, taking into account the risks linked to the re-routing of flows;       establish at its headquarters the facilities necessary for real-time coordination between Member States;       draw up a working arrangement with relevant international organisations, such as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).       A Coastal Patrol Network      The Commission recommends that:      a permanent coastal patrol network be set up at the external southern maritime frontiers, as suggested by the "MEDSEA" feasibility study presented by FRONTEX on 14 July 2006;       the management network be entrusted to FRONTEX and it be asked to consider the possibility of setting up several regional command centres at the southern maritime external borders; the main role of these centres (each one covering a specific area: the Canary Islands, the western, central and eastern Mediterranean Sea) would be to carry out daily patrols, but they might also be required to take part in join maritime operations;       FRONTEX consider setting up a specialised branch for maritime borders in the region responsible for managing the regional command centres.       A European surveillance system      The Commission suggests that a European Surveillance System for Borders (EUROSUR) be created. EUROSUR could, as a first step, link up the existing national surveillance systems currently in use at the southern maritime external borders. It would then gradually replace the national surveillance systems at land and maritime borders.      Improving the capacity to deal with mixed flows      The Commission proposes that a pool of experts from Member States' administrations be made available for deployment at short notice to carry out an initial assessment of individual cases at points of arrival, in particular regarding the state of health of immigrants and the identification of persons who may need international protection or who may be returned to their countries of origin or transit. The asylum expert teams that would be established from this pool would assist the requesting Member State on a temporary basis in performing this initial profiling through the provision, in particular, of interpretation services and advice on case handling. They might, if necessary, include officials of relevant international organisations such as the UNHCR.     In the short term, the Commission encourages Member States as well as international organisations to make use of relevant Community funding instruments to launch these teams on a project basis. It proposes that continued thought be given to the role which a possible European support office for all forms of cooperation between Member States relating to the Common European Asylum System might play in the setting up of such teams.      The operational implementation of the international law of the sea      The Commission will publish a study on the international law of the sea analysing the gaps in the international legal framework and identifying the issues that could be further explored. It proposes that:      the correct modus operandi for intercepting vessels carrying, or suspected of carrying, illegal immigrants bound for the European Union be more accurately determined; regional agreements could define the right of surveillance and interception of vessels in the territorial waters of relevant countries of origin and transit, smoothing the way for the implementation of joint operations by FRONTEX;       the extent of the Member States' protection obligations flowing from the respect of the principle of non-refoulement in the many different situations where their vessels implement interception or search and rescue measures be examined. It proposes that practical instructions be drawn up to determine the circumstances under which a Member State may be obliged to assume responsibility for the examination of an asylum claim when engaged in joint operations or in operations taking place within the territorial waters of another Member State or on the high seas.      It also stresses the importance of the ratification by the Member States and the African states of the Palermo Protocol against the smuggling of migrants by land, sea and air.      Maximising the use of European Community financial means      The budget of the FRONTEX Agency (EUR 33.98 million earmarked for 2007) will be used to finance joint operations and pilot projects with Member States at the external frontiers, including the establishment of a Coastal Patrol Network, regional command centres and a specialised branch for maritime borders in the region.     The Commission takes the view that an efficient and rapid use of the resources to be provided by the new External Borders Fund (1.82 billion for the period 2007-2013, of which 170 million will be available in 2007) will be essential for the implementation of the measures envisaged. Moreover, a yearly reserve of 10 million will be set aside to allow for the financing of actions by the individual Member States to address weaknesses at strategic border points, as identified by the FRONTEX by means of risk analysis.     With a view to the longer term, in its 7th Framework Programme for research and technological development, the Commission foresees research for improved capabilities in the implementation of an integrated border management system.     Against the background of the preliminary draft budget for 2007, the European Parliament approved a preparatory action in 2007 (15 million, to be confirmed) for "Migration management/solidarity in action" to assist Member States in coping with the influx of illegal immigrants arriving by sea.     Community activities financed by the European Refugee Fund (ERF) may cover the cost of projects relating to the setting-up teams of asylum experts. In addition, ERF III will provide a mechanism allowing Member States facing particular pressure situations to have rapid and easy access to emergency financial assistance from the Fund.      Background      In the last two years, the pressure of illegal immigration faced by Member States has grown. The Communication was drawn up in response to the Council's request of 5 October 2006 and is geared towards the first part of a two-pronged approach. Initially, operational measures are set out which are designed to combat illegal immigration, protect refugees and set up controls at, and surveillance of, the EU's external maritime borders. The second part continues and strengthens the dialogue and cooperation with third countries on these operational measures in the context of the Association Agreements, the ENP Action Plans and the Cotonou Agreement.

act   Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Public-private partnerships in Horizon 2020: a powerful tool to deliver on innovation and growth in Europe (  COM(2013) 494  final,10.7.2013).   summary   To encourage EU research and innovation, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) includes two articles which have been used as a legal basis for establishing public-private and public-public partnerships in research and innovation:    Article 187 TFEU  covers  public-private partnerships  , typically involving the EU, industrial association(s) and other partners. These partnerships are managed by legal entities called  joint undertakings  which are responsible for implementing the research agenda in the area they cover.    Article 185 TFEU  covers  public-public partnerships,  with participation of the EU in research and development programmes undertaken by several EU countries.    Public-private partnerships   In meeting the objectives of  Horizon 2020  public private partnerships help to:   enable a long-term, strategic approach to research and innovation and reduce uncertainties by allowing for long-term commitments;   share common resources and critical mass thanks to their legal structure. This enables a scale of research effort that individual firms would not be able to achieve on their own. This is thanks to  smart specialisation  and the combining of Horizon 2020 and European structural and investment funding;   make research and innovation funding across the EU more efficient by sharing financial, human and infrastructure resources. This reduces the risk of fragmentation (i.e. where research is dispersed and uncoordinated), and leads to economies of scale and reduced costs for all partners involved;   better address complex challenges as they help develop interdisciplinary approaches and allow for a more efficient sharing of knowledge and expertise;   facilitate the creation of an internal market for innovative products and services, by advancing jointly on critical issues such as access to finance, standardisation and norm setting;   enable innovative technologies to get faster to the market, including by allowing companies to collaborate and share information, thereby accelerating the learning process;   provide the right framework for international companies to anchor their research and innovation investments in Europe and benefit from European strengths such as a well-trained workforce, diversity in approaches and sectorial creativity; and   enable the scale of research and innovation effort needed to address critical societal challenges and major EU policy objectives under the Europe 2020 strategy.   Some of the public-private partnerships under Horizon 2020 involve partnerships that were initially established under EU's seventh framework programme (FP7) for Research and Development (R&D) or are new partnerships:    Bio-based Industries  JTI JU, new under Horizon 2020,    Clean Sky 2  JTI JU, successor of the Clean Sky JTI JU,    ECSEL  (Electronic Components and Systems for European Leadership - a merger of the former ARTEMIS embedded systems JTI JU and of the former ENIAC nanoelectronics JTI JU, expanded to also address smart systems),    Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2  JTI JU, successor of the FCH JTI JU,    Innovative Medicines 2  JTI JU, successor of the IMI JTI JU.   Besides the abovementioned  JTI JUs  , another form of public-private partnership on the basis of Article 187 TFEU also operates under Horizon 2020:   the  Single European Sky ATM Research Joint Undertaking  (SESAR JU) established in FP7 will continue in Horizon 2020 (coordination of the technical pillar of the Single European Sky initiative which aims at modernising Air Traffic Management in Europe),   the  Shift2Rail Joint Undertaking  (S2R JU), new under Horizon 2020 (coordination and management of the Union research and innovation investments in the European rail sector).    Contractual Public-Private partnerships   Under Horizon 2020, these are based on a contractual arrangement between the Commission and industry partners (not under Art. 187 TFEU and different from the abovementioned institutionalised public private partnerships). These contractual public private partnerships were considered in the following areas:    Factories of the Future  ;    Energy-efficient Buildings  ;    Green Vehicles Initiative  ;    Sustainable Process Industry  ;    Photonics  ;    Robotics  ;    High Performance Computing  ;    Advanced 5G networks for the Future Internet  .    Public-public partnerships   Article 185 TFEU enables the EU to participate in research programmes undertaken jointly by several EU countries, including participation in the structures created for the execution of national programmes.  Some of the public-public partnerships under Horizon 2020 involve partnerships that were launched under previous Framework Programmes (FP6 or FP7) for R & D or are new partnerships:   the  Active and Assisted Living Research and Development Programme,    the second  European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership  (EDCTP 2),   the  European Metrology Programme for Innovation and Research  (EMPIR),   the  Eurostars 2 programme supporting research and development performing SMEs  .
   The open internet and net neutrality     The open internet and net neutrality     In 2009, the European Commission undertook a reform of telecoms legislation in the European Union (EU) and emphasised the need to monitor market and technological developments in relation to “net freedoms”. This Communication therefore responds to the desire to preserve an internet in line with those freedoms, i.e. an “open” and “neutral” internet.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 19 April 2011 - The open internet and net neutrality in Europe [       COM(2011) 222      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This Communication aims to promote the       neutral      and       open      character of the internet, in accordance with the       Digital Agenda for Europe      . The intention is to preserve the openness of the internet while enabling it to provide high-quality, innovative services, and to guarantee fundamental rights such as freedom of expression and freedom to conduct business.     The worldwide success of the internet may be explained in part by its       openness      and       accessibility      to all, individuals and companies alike. However, this Communication stresses that its full potential remains untapped.      Challenges to net neutrality      The concept of net neutrality is defined in part in the       Framework Directive on electronic communications      as the ability of end users to access and distribute information or run applications and services of their choice.     The current       obstacles to net neutrality      are:       the blocking or throttling of traffic        by certain network operators, which takes the form of restricting access to internet services (online television, videoconferences, etc.) or to websites. The         Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications        (BEREC) and the national regulatory authorities (NRAs) may receive users’ complaints;        traffic congestion        , which requires reasonable management. There are three different traffic management techniques to alleviate congestion:        lack of transparency        , which prevents consumers from making informed choices in terms of services. NRAs are therefore obliged to set minimum quality of service requirements.       Regulatory framework concerning net neutrality      The provisions of the regulatory framework are structured around two principal elements:       the principles of competition        : net neutrality is strongly correlated with market competition. It is therefore important that retail pricing of internet access is not regulated in the EU in order that consumers can benefit from a wide variety of services at different price points adapted to their needs.        the amended Telecommunications framework        : this legislative framework was amended in 2009. It helps to preserve the open and neutral character of the internet by ensuring that consumers are informed about the: This framework also enables consumers to switch operators while keeping their numbers, within one working day.      Net neutrality is also strongly dependent on the       protection of personal data      .      Ways to preserve net neutrality and openness      The Commission is currently studying solutions to put in place to deal with obstacles caused by:      switching;       blocking practices;       throttling practices;       certain commercial practices at the root of blocking and throttling;       discriminatory practices by a dominant player.      However, the Commission must ensure that the measures taken do not hinder freedom of expression and freedom of information and continue to preserve private and family life as well as personal data.      Context      This Communication is based on the results of a public consultation on the open internet and net neutrality conducted between 30 June and 30 September 2010 with participants including network operators, content providers, Member States, consumer and civil society organisations and individuals.     The Commission intends to continue working with BEREC in order to adopt additional provisions on net neutrality.

   Goods: carriage between Member States     Goods: carriage between Member States     This Regulation sets out the arrangements for issuing licences to road hauliers. It defines the conditions of issue and withdrawal.     ACT     Council Regulation (EEC) No       881/92      of 26 March 1992 on access to the market in the carriage of goods by road within the Community to or from the territory of a Member State or passing across the territory of one or more Member States [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     The uniform arrangements for access to the market are based on the elimination of restrictions on service providers and a carriage authorisation scheme. They also aid progress towards the establishment of a European transport market.      Scope      These arrangements apply to the international carriage of goods by road carried out on European Union (EU) territory on behalf of a third party. For journeys linking a Member State to a third country, the arrangements apply to the journey carried out on the territory of the Member State of loading or unloading. In the latter case, an agreement between the EU and the third country in question is needed for the arrangements to apply.      Community authorisation      The Community authorisation is issued by a Member State for a period of five years to any carrier which is established in another Member State in accordance with the legislation there, and which is authorised to carry goods by road internationally.     The original copy of the authorisation is issued to the haulage company, which is the holder. The company also receives certified copies for each vehicle       *      that it uses. The authorisation is drawn up in the name of the carrier and is non-transferable. Copies must be kept in the vehicles and shown on demand to inspectors.      Driver attestation      The driver attestation is issued by the Member State of establishment to any haulage company which holds a Community authorisation and which in that Member State legally employs or uses drivers       *      who are nationals of a third country. It is issued in respect of each national of a third country employed by the company which is the holder of the authorisation. The attestation is the property of the company, which provides it to the driver of the designated vehicle.     The driver attestation is issued for a period which is laid down by the Member State of establishment. It may not, however, exceed five years.      Infringements and penalties      The Member States may check that the issuing conditions of the attestation or the authorisation are met. If this is not the case, they can refuse to issue or renew them.     Furthermore, the Member States are to inform the Commission, by 31 January of each year at the latest, of the number of companies which hold a Community authorisation and certified copies relating to vehicles on the road.     Where infringements are committed the Member States may impose penalties, such as the suspension or withdrawal of the driver attestation or the certified copies. They may also impose additional conditions on the issuing of attestations.     The Member States of establishment must also ensure that holders have the option of appealing against any penalty decision.       Key terms used in the act         Driver: person who drives a vehicle, or who is carried in that vehicle in order to be available for driving if necessary.         Vehicle: a motor vehicle registered in a Member State or a coupled combination of vehicles, the motor vehicle of which at least is registered in a Member State, used exclusively for the carriage of goods.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 establishing a system for the identification and registration of ovine and caprine animals   what is the aim of this regulation  It aims to ensure the traceability  *  of ovine and caprine animals (sheep and goats) by requiring European Union (EU) countries to put in place a uniform identification and registration system.   key points    Each EU country must set up a system for the identification and registration of sheep and goats with the following elements:   a  means of identification  for each animal;    registers  kept on each holding with information about the holding, the people responsible for the animals, the activity, the type of production and the animals kept;    movement documents  , to be kept for at least 3 years, but optional if the country has a centralised computer database which includes animal movements;   a  central register  or computer database of all holdings and movements of batches of animals at national level.     All sheep and goats must have  2 identifiers  with the same unique individual identification number. One must be an electronic identifier (EID).    Visible identifiers  are conventional eartags, but can also be a mark on the pastern (leg band). A  tattoo  may also be used as unless the animal is destined for trade between EU countries. Electronic identifiers (EID) are typically an electronic eartags, but a ruminal bolus (an EID which is ingested by the animal and can be scanned can also be used).   Animals intended for slaughter before the age of 12 months, not intended for intra-EU trade or export to non-EU countries, may have only  1 visible conventional eartag  .   Identification tags must display the  country of birth  and the  individual animal code  .    Identification  must be carried out  within 6 months of birth  and before the animal leaves its holding of origin. It may be extended to 9 months if the animals are kept in extensive or free-range farming conditions. The identification of animals imported from outside the EU must take place within 14 days.   EU countries where the total number of sheep and goats is 600,000 or less, or where the total number of goats alone is 160,000 or less, may make electronic identification  optional  if the animals are not destined for trade between EU countries.   EU countries must impose  penalties  for infringement of the regulation.   The regulation will be repealed and replaced by  Regulation (EU) 2016/429  with effect from 20 April 2021.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 29 January 2004 except for Articles 14, 15 and 16 which have applied since 9 July 2005. Certain optional rules became compulsory from 1 January 2010.   * key terms     Traceability:  the ability to track any food, feed, food-producing animal or substance that will be used for consumption, through all stages of production, processing and distribution.
summary of   Decision 98/181/EC, ECSC, Euratom — conclusion, by the European Communities, of the Energy Charter Treaty and the Energy Charter Protocol on energy efficiency and related environmental aspects    Final Act of the International Conference and Decision by the Energy Charter Conference in respect of the amendment to the trade-related provisions of the Energy Charter Treaty — Joint Declarations — Annex I: Amendment to the Trade-Related Provisions of the Energy Charter Treaty — Annex II: Decisions in connection with the Adoption of the Amendment to the Trade-Related Provisions of the Energy Charter Treaty    Final Act of the Conference on the European Energy Charter — Annex 1: The Energy Charter Treaty — Annex 2: Decisions with respect to the Energy Charter Treaty   what is the aim of the decision and the treaty   The Energy Charter Treaty is a multilateral framework for  energy  cooperation designed to promote energy security through more open and competitive energy markets, respecting the principles of  sustainable development  and sovereignty over energy resources, based on the principles in the Energy Charter.   The decision by the  Council of the EU  and  European Commission  approves the Energy Charter Treaty and the Energy Charter Protocol on behalf of the European Communities (  EU  ) and  Euratom  .   key points   The key clauses of the Energy Charter Treaty concern protecting investment, trade in energy materials and products, transit and dispute settlement.   Commerce, investment, trade and protections   The treaty’s provisions include:   promoting access to international markets on commercial terms, and generally to develop an open and competitive market, for energy materials and products;   protecting foreign investment, based on treatment no less favourable than that accorded by the best national investment terms, and against key non-commercial risks;   working to alleviate market distortions and barriers to  competition  in economic activity in the energy sector;   ensuring reliable cross-border energy transit flows through pipelines, grids and other forms of transportation;   recognising the importance of open capital markets to encourage the flow of capital to finance trade in energy materials and products and investment in economic activity in the energy sector;   encouraging and creating stable, fair and transparent conditions for investors of other parties to make investments in the area covered by the treaty.    Sovereignty over energy resources   The treaty recognises countries’ sovereign rights over energy resources and reaffirms that these must be exercised in accordance with international law, without affecting the general objective of promoting access to energy resources, and their exploration and commercial development.   Environmental aspects    Parties to the treaty agree to promote energy efficiency, and attempts to minimise the environmental impact of energy production and use.   The polluter should, in principle, bear the cost of pollution, including trans-boundary pollution, without distorting investment in the energy cycle or international trade.    Transparency   Parties to the treaty must designate at least one inquiry point to which requests for information on laws, regulations, legal decisions and general administrative decisions regarding energy materials and products may be addressed.   Dispute settlement   The treaty includes provisions for resolving disputes between participating states through diplomatic channels and ad hoc tribunals, and — in the case of investments — between investors and host states. If an investor dispute cannot be settled amicably within 3 months, investors may choose to submit it for resolution to:   the courts or administrative tribunals;   any previously agreed dispute settlement procedure; or   international arbitration or conciliation.    Signatories, the Energy Charter Conference, protocols and declarations    Signatories to the treaty include EU countries and regional economic integration organisations (such as the EU) committed to observing its principles of open and non-discriminatory energy markets.   The parties meet periodically in the  Energy Charter Conference  where each is entitled to have one representative. Ordinary meetings are held at intervals determined by the Charter Conference. It may also authorise the negotiation of Energy Charter Protocols or Declarations to pursue the objectives and principles of the charter.    Exceptions   Parties must not make any trade-related investments inconsistent with the  1994 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  which established the  World Trade Organization (WTO)  , and nothing in the treaty exempts WTO members from the agreement.  The treaty does not preclude any signatory from measures:   necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health;   essential to getting or distributing energy materials and products where there is short supply arising from external causes;   designed to benefit investors who are indigenous people or socially or economically disadvantaged individuals or groups.    Energy Charter Protocol   The protocol was adopted in accordance with the treaty. Its objectives include:   promoting energy-efficiency policies compatible with sustainable development;   creating conditions for producers and consumers to use energy efficiently, respecting the environment;   encouraging cooperation on energy efficiency;   formulating energy efficiency policies and legal and regulatory frameworks to promote effective market mechanisms, including market-led pricing.    International Energy Charter   A new  International Energy Charter  was adopted and signed in 2015 by over 65 countries and organisations, including the EU and all EU countries. The purpose of this new charter is to engage as many new countries as possible who are willing to cooperate in the field of energy and who recognise the importance of energy security for energy-producing, -transit and -consuming countries. The new charter builds upon and modernises the Energy Charter of 1991.   date of entry into force   The Energy Charter Treaty entered into force on 16 April 1998, with amendments on trade-related provisions, principally to replace references to the GATT with the WTO, applying from 23 July 1998.   background   See also:    Energy Charter  (  European Commission  )    The Energy Charter Treaty  (  International Energy Charter  )    The International Energy Charter  (2015) (  International Energy Charter  ).   main documents   Council and Commission Decision  98/181/EC, ECSC, Euratom  of 23 September 1997 on the conclusion, by the European Communities, of the Energy Charter Treaty and the Energy Charter Protocol on energy efficiency and related environmental aspects (OJ L 69, 9.3.1998, pp. 1-116)   Final Act  of the International Conference and Decision by the Energy Charter Conference in respect of the amendment to the trade-related provisions of the Energy Charter Treaty - Joint Declarations - Annex I: Amendment to the Trade-Related Provisions of the Energy Charter Treaty - Annex II: Decisions in connection with the Adoption of the Amendment to the Trade-Related Provisions of the Energy Charter Treaty (OJ L 252, 12.9.1998, pp. 23-46)   Final Act  of the Conference on the European Energy Charter - Annex 1: The Energy Charter Treaty - Annex 2: Decisions with respect to the Energy Charter Treaty (OJ L 380, 31.12.1994, pp. 24-88)
summary of   Decision 2013/275/EU on the signing, on behalf of the EU, of the Beijing Treaty on Audiovisual Performances    Beijing Treaty on Audiovisual Performances   what is the aim of the decision  The decision approves the signing of the  WIPO Beijing Treaty on Audiovisual Performances (the Beijing Treaty)  on behalf of the EU, subject to its being officially concluded.  The treaty modernises   intellectual rights  protection  for singers, musicians, dancers and actors in audiovisual performances in film and television and also includes musicians’ performances on DVD or other audiovisual platforms.  It aims to have a positive effect on all signatories, including developing and developed countries, in relation to economic development, improved status of audiovisual performers and cultural diversity.   key points   The treaty grants performers economic rights in live and recorded performances, as well as certain moral rights updating the  Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organizations (1961)  for the digital era and complementing the  WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT)  .   Recorded performances   The treaty grants performers  4 kinds of economic rights  for their performances fixed (recorded) in audiovisual formats, such as  video recordings  :    reproduction  : the right to authorise direct or indirect reproduction of the fixation of the performance in any manner or form;    distribution  : the right to authorise the sale of originals or copies of the fixation of the performance;    rental  : the right to authorise public rentals of originals or copies of the fixation of the performance; and    making available  : the right to authorise giving access to fixation of performances wherever and whenever the consumer chooses, wired or wirelessly, in particular including on-demand or interactively through the internet.    Live performances   Moreover, the treaty grants performers  3 kinds of economic rights  for unfixed (live) performances:   right of broadcasting;   right of communication to the public;   right of fixation.    Moral rights   The treaty grants the performer the right to be identified as the performer, and the right to object to any distortion, mutilation or other modification to the recorded or broadcast material that would be prejudicial to their reputation.   Transfer of rights   Parties may state in their laws that once a performer has consented to a performance being recorded (audiovisual fixation), exclusive rights are transferred to the recording’s producer (unless a contract between the performer and producer states otherwise). Independently of this, national laws or other agreements may give the performer the right to receive royalties or fair payments for any use of the performance under the treaty.   Exceptions, enforcement and remedies   The treaty allows for limitations and exceptions provided that they comply with the  Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works  . Contracting parties may add new exceptions and limitations appropriate to the digital environment if similar conditions are met. The treaty applies to existing and new recorded material, but parties may decide that existing material from other countries is not protected under the treaty, in which case the countries concerned are entitled to act reciprocally.  Parties to the treaty must provide for legal remedies against the bypassing of any digital encryption used by performers to protect their rights, and against the removal or altering of information (such as performer credit) necessary for rights management, including licensing and distribution of royalties.  Parties must provide for enforcement procedures and remedies to prevent and deter infringements to the treaty.  The treaty sets up an Assembly of the Contracting Parties to maintain and develop the treaty.   from when does the decision apply  The decision was signed on 10 June 2013. It will enter into force 3 months after 30 eligible parties to the treaty have ratified the treaty.   background   See also:    World Intellectual Property Organization  (  WIPO  )    WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty  (1996) (  WIPO  )    Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organizations  (1961) (  WIPO  )    Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works  (1886-1979) (  WIPO  ).   main documents   Council Decision  2013/275/EU  of 10 June 2013 on the signing, on behalf of the European Union, of the Beijing Treaty on Audiovisual Performances (OJ L 160, 12.6.2013, p. 1)   Beijing Treaty on Audiovisual Performances  (not published in the OJ)
   Disclosure of non-financial and diversity information by large companies and groups     Disclosure of non-financial and diversity information by large companies and groups     SUMMARY OF:      Directive 2014/95/EU on disclosure of non-financial and diversity information      WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?     It requires certain large companies to disclose relevant non-financial information to provide investors and other stakeholders with a more complete picture of their development, performance and position and of the impact of their activity.     KEY POINTS     The directive applies to certain large companies and groups with       more than 500 employees      .      Information      Such companies are required to give a review of their business model, policies, outcomes, principal risks and key performance indicators, including on:      environmental matters;       social and employee aspects;       respect for human rights;       anti-corruption and bribery issues.      If companies do not have a policy on one of these areas, the non-financial statement should explain why not. Companies also have to report about their policy on the diversity of the board of directors.      Guidelines      Companies should disclose this information in their annual report, although some EU countries have chosen to allow companies to disclose this information in a separate report if they want to. In preparing their statements, companies may use national, European or international guidelines such as the       UN Global Compact      .     The       European Commission      produced non-binding guidelines on how to report non-financial information in 2017. In 2019 it will produce additional guidelines on how to report information about the climate.      Subsidiary companies      A subsidiary company is not required to produce a statement if the information is included in the report of its parent company (i.e. the company that controls the management and operation of the subsidiary company).     FROM WHEN DOES THIS DIRECTIVE APPLY?     The directive has applied since 5 December 2014. It had to become law in the EU countries by 6 December 2016. Companies had to report in accordance with the directive for the first time in 2018, covering financial year 2017.

act   Regulation (EC) No  1013/2006  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 on shipments of waste.   summary   The European Union (EU) has a system to supervise and control shipments of waste within its borders and with the countries of the  European Free Trade Association  (EFTA), the  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  (OECD) and non-EU countries that have signed the  Basel Convention  .   what does this regulation do  It lays down rules for controlling waste shipments in order to improve environmental protection.  It also incorporates the provisions of the  Basel Convention  and the revision of the OECD’s 2001  decision  on the control of transboundary movements of wastes destined for recovery operations (i.e. where a waste is processed to recover a usable product or converted into a fuel) in EU law.   key points   The law applies to shipments of waste:        •     between EU countries within the EU or transiting via non-EU countries;            •     imported into the EU from non-EU countries;            •     exported from the EU to non-EU countries;            •     in transit through the EU, on the way from or to non-EU countries.      It covers almost all types of waste, with the exception of  radioactive waste  ,  waste generated on board ships  , shipments subject to the approval requirements of the  animal by-product regulation  , certain shipments of waste from the Antarctic, imports into the EU of certain waste generated by armed forces or relief organisations in situations of crisis, etc.   Control procedures   There are two control procedures for the shipment of waste, namely:        1.     the  general information requirements  of Article 18, which is normally applicable to shipments for  recovery  of wastes, listed in Annex III (‘green’ listed wastes - non-hazardous, such as paper or plastics) or IIIA; and            2.     the procedure of  prior written notification and consent  for other types of shipments of wastes, including:         •     shipments of wastes listed in Annex IV (‘amber’ listed wastes containing both hazardous and non-hazardous parts) or in Part 2 of Annex V (European list of wastes, e.g. wastes from mining, quarrying and physical and chemical treatment of minerals); and             •     shipments for  disposal  of wastes listed in Annex III (‘green’ listed wastes).           Other provisions         •     All parties involved must ensure that waste is managed in an  environmentally sound  manner, respecting EU and international rules, throughout the shipment process and when it is recovered or disposed of.            •     The notification procedure requires the  prior written consent  of the competent authorities of the countries concerned by the shipment (country of dispatch, country of transit and country of destination) to be given within 30 days.            •     The notifier has a duty to take back waste shipments that are found to be illegal or cannot be provided as intended (including the recovery or disposal of waste).       Trade bans   Exports to non-EU countries of waste for  disposal  are prohibited, except to EFTA countries that are party to the Basel Convention.  Exports for recovery of  hazardous waste  (i.e. that poses a risk to human health and the environment) are prohibited, except those directed to countries to which the OECD decision applies.  Imports from non-EU countries of waste for  disposal or recovery  are prohibited, except for imports:        •     from countries to which the OECD decision applies;            •     non-EU countries that are party to the Basel Convention;            •     countries that have concluded a bilateral agreement with the EU or EU countries; or            •     other areas during situations of crisis.       Inspection systems   The law was amended in  2014  to strengthen EU countries’ inspection systems. It lays down minimum inspection requirements with a focus on problematic waste streams (such as hazardous waste and waste sent illegally for dumping or sub-standard treatment). EU countries will have to prepare inspection plans by 2017.   when does the regulation apply  From 15.7.2006.  For more information, see the European Commission’s  waste shipments website  .

   Financing SME Growth     Financing SME Growth     It is essential to guarantee small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) better access to debt and equity finance and thus allow them to achieve their potential. The objective for the European Union (EU) and the Member States is to create the conditions which will make it possible to triple early-stage investment by 2013.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social committee and the Committee of the Regions of 29 June 2006 - Implementing the Community Lisbon Programme: Financing SME Growth - Adding European Value [       COM(2006) 349      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The challenge of financing for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)     Improving access to finance for SMEs, and more specifically initial investment and the ongoing injection of equity, is essential if an SME is to tap into its growth and innovation potential. However, a large number of SMEs in the EU face an equity gap. 2. When their initial funds have been exhausted, entrepreneurs have to obtain external finance to develop their project. Financing SMEs is, however, often considered too risky on account of the low rates of return, particularly during the seed phase. There is thus a serious lack of business angels and venture capital funds that are willing to invest in young innovative SMEs.     The inability to obtain early-stage investment prevents many SMEs reaching a size where they can attract expansion capital, thus stunting their growth.     SMEs, as sources of innovation and job creation, are the engines of European growth, and giving them the opportunity to start up, develop and achieve their potential makes a vital contribution to the Lisbon process.      Boosting SME financing      The European Commission suggests different measures to boost financing for SMEs.      Raising more venture capital investment      Encouraging venture capital investment involves the establishment of an internal market for venture capital. The aim is to overcome the fragmentation of the venture capital market and allow the various operators to invest across borders without incurring unfavourable tax treatment.     More attention should also be paid to the exit strategy (the point at which the venture capitalist can recover his capital by giving up his share). As initial public offerings of stock provide a natural exit route for venture capital investors, it is essential to make European growth stock markets more liquid and efficient.     The EU should also develop a growth and investment culture. Successful entrepreneurs should therefore be encouraged to invest in turn and become business angels.      Developing debt finance for SMEs      The EU should encourage traditional bank finance for innovation. A round table between banks and SMEs will be organised in order to improve the scope for long-term banking relationships, promote microfinance (loans of less than 25 000) and "mezzanine finance" (hybrids of loans and equity), and also evaluate the advantages of tax relief systems for young innovative companies.      Strengthening the EU contribution to SME financing      The EU needs to devote more resources to SME financing.     The main existing Community instruments in this respect are the       Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) (2007-2013)      , the JEREMIE (Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises) initiative, under the EU's regional policy and the       Seventh Research Framework Programme (2007-2013)      .     The EU has also reviewed its regulations on State aid for risk capital funds, particularly to help innovative SMEs.      Introducing better governance at national level      It is also up to the Member States to ensure that the regulatory and fiscal environment favours SME access to debt finance and venture capital. Some Member States have already been successful in doing so. It is therefore essential to identify and spread good practices.     It is also recommended that the Member States draw up support schemes for entrepreneurs to make them aware of investor concerns and prepare them on how to present their projects better.      Background      This Communication forms part of the       Lisbon strategy      and its proposals complement the Communication on a       modern policy for SMEs      .     The European Commission will present a report on the progress made in SME financing in 2009 that will feed into the reporting on progress with the renewed Lisbon strategy.

   The future of health care and care for the elderly: guaranteeing accessibility, quality and financial viability     The future of health care and care for the elderly: guaranteeing accessibility, quality and financial viability     All national health care systems are today faced with three major challenges, as the population of Europe is ageing, health care is increasingly effective but also becoming more expensive, and patients, having become true consumers, are also more demanding. Faced with these three challenges, the Commission has proposed three long-term objectives: access to health care for all, a high level of quality in health care and ensuring the financial viability of health care systems.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 5 December 2001 - The future of health care and care for the elderly: guaranteeing accessibility, quality and financial viability [       COM(2001) 723      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The EU's overall health situation and health care systems are among the best in the world, thanks to the widespread extension of cover against sickness and invalidity, the rise in the standard of living, improved living conditions and better health education.     Total health care spending rose from around 5 % of GDP in 1970 to over 8 % in 1998. Public health care spending followed the same trend of growing faster than GDP in most countries.      ISSUES COMMON TO ALL EU HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS       The impact of demographic ageing on health care systems and expenditure      The ageing of the population in Europe involves two aspects:      since 1970, life expectancy at birth has risen by 5.5 years for women and almost 5 years for men. This trend also means higher life expectancy in "good health" and in the absence of disability;       there are more elderly people. The proportion of the total European population older than 65 is set to increase from 16.1 % in 2000 to 27.5 % by 2050, while the proportion of the population aged over 80 years (3.6 % in 2000) is expected to reach 10 % by 2050.      If Eurostat's basic scenarios are confirmed, public expenditure on health care could increase by between 0.7 and 2.3 GDP points in the period 2000-2050.     The increase in the numbers of elderly people will thus increase the pressure on the public sector for long-term care.     In light of these needs, health care structures, methods of financing and the organisation of services will have to evolve. It will be particularly important to deal with the increased need for skilled manpower, as smaller and more unstable family structures make it increasingly difficult to rely on the support of family networks.      The growth of new technologies and treatments      Developments in medical technology (gene therapies, growing replacement organs, new medicinal substances, etc.) provide benefits for patients, for example by reducing the risks of serious illness by means of preventive treatment. However, these innovations come at a cost, and financing is an issue that must be considered. In the context of prudent budget management, clear, transparent and effective evaluation mechanisms must be developed, as this is the only way to guarantee greater accessibility to these new products and treatments.      The increase in patients' demands      It has been observed for half a century that the demand for health care tends to increase more than proportionally to the per capita income. Demand is determined by standard of living and level of education. This has three main consequences:      patients are better educated and are able to adopt healthier lifestyles and a prevention-based attitude which in the long run makes it possible to avoid the need for costly care. This is why health care systems are focusing increasingly on education and prevention;       patients expect ever better quality and efficiency from health care systems. The spread of information technologies gives patients access to more information on services available at European level and allows them to make an increasingly well-informed choice;       health care consumers feel that they need to be considered as partners and players in health care systems, not only by health professionals but also by the public authorities. They also expect greater transparency on the performance and quality of care services.       THREE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES: ACCESSIBLITY, QUALITY, VIABILITY      While the organisation of health care systems, their funding (ratio of public/private funding) and planning as a function of the needs of the population are a matter for the Member States, this responsibility is exercised increasingly within a general framework on which many Community policies have a bearing (research, public health policy, free movement of persons and services, viability of public funds). This is an argument for strengthening European cooperation.     The Communication identifies three long-term objectives for national systems, which should be pursued in parallel.      Accessibility      Access to health care is a right enshrined in the       Charter of Fundamental Rights      of the European Union. However, it is often affected by an individual's social status. It is therefore particularly important to ensure that access to health care for disadvantaged groups and for the poorest members of society is guaranteed.     The joint report to evaluate the national action plans for social inclusion proposes three categories of measures:      measures to develop disease prevention and promote health education (mother and child care, medical care at school and medical care at work);       providing less expensive and even free care for those in low-income brackets;       measures aimed at disadvantaged groups, e.g. the mentally ill, migrants, the homeless, alcoholics and drug addicts.       Quality      In order to provide quality health care, national governments are required to achieve an optimum balance between the health benefits and the cost of medication and treatment. Ascertaining quality in this way is made complex by:      the diversity of the structures and levels of health care, which often influence demand for health care and consequently the level of expenditure;       the different approaches to medical treatment.      Comparative analysis of health care systems and medical treatment should make it possible to identify "best practice" and thus to help improve the quality of health care systems.      Financial viability      A certain level of financing is required to ensure the availability of high-quality health care that is accessible to the population. There is upward pressure on these health care costs, irrespective of the way in which Member States' health care systems are organised. Member States have been undertaking reforms since the early 1990s, based mainly on two methods:      regulation of demand, by increasing contributions or by ensuring that the final consumer bears an increasingly large share of the costs;       regulation of supply, by determining budgets or resource envelopes for health care providers, creating a contractual relationship between "buyers" and "providers" of health care.      It is often difficult, however, to distinguish the short-term effects from the more structural effects of these reforms, which allow spending to develop at a sustainable pace. This Communication recommends more exchanges of experience, which would help to keep track of the policies introduced and would be a useful way of comparing health care systems and encouraging progress.     In order to achieve these objectives it is essential that all parties concerned (local authorities, health care professionals, social protection bodies, supplementary insurance companies, consumers) work together to build strong partnerships.      Background      This Communication is a response to the conclusions of the       Lisbon European Council      of March 2000, which stressed that social protection systems needed to be reformed in order to be able to provide high-quality health care services. It also takes up the request made by the Gothenburg summit (June 2001) to prepare a progress report for the Spring 2002 European Council suggesting guidelines in the field of health and care for the elderly.       Key figures         life expectancy in 2000: 74.7 for men and 81.1 for women         life expectancy in 2050 (Eurostat forecast): 79.7 for men and 85.1 for women         percentage of people aged over 65 in Europe in 2000: 16.1 %         percentage of people aged over 65 in Europe in 2050: 27.5 %         percentage of people aged over 80 in Europe in 2000: 3.6 %         percentage of people aged over 80 in Europe in 2050: 10 %       RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission of 20 April 2004 - Modernising social protection for the development of high-quality, accessible and sustainable health care and long-term care: support for the national strategies using the "open method of coordination" [         COM(2004) 304        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      This Communication proposes that the "open method of coordination" be extended to the health and long-term care sector. This will allow a framework to be established to promote exchanges of experience and best practices and support the Member States in the reform of health care and long-term care.      Joint report from the Commission and the Council on health care and care for the elderly:         Supporting national strategies for ensuring a high level of social protection        .      The Barcelona European Council (2002) invited the Commission and the Council to examine more thoroughly the questions of access, quality and financial sustainability. A questionnaire was sent to the Member States in 2002 in order to collect information on their approaches to these three objectives. The joint report is based on the responses received.     This joint report was adopted by the "Employment, Social Affairs, Health and Consumer Affairs" Council on 6 March and by the "Economic and Financial Affairs" Council on 7 March as a contribution to the March 2003 European Council.

summary of   Directive 2002/99/EC: animal health rules on the production, processing, distribution and introduction of animal products for human consumption   summary    what does the directive do   It lays down general animal health rules for products intended for human consumption.   These cover all stages of the production, processing and distribution processes carried out within the EU, and imports from other countries.   key points    National authorities must ensure that all those involved in the food chain do not spread transmissible diseases to animals.   Products must come from animals which are not covered by any territorial health restrictions.   Meat and meat products are forbidden from premises where there were infected animals, or animals suspected of being infected, during the slaughtering process.   Edible products must be accompanied by a veterinary certificate.   National authorities carry out official animal health controls. The inspections are generally unannounced.    European Commission  experts, in conjunction with national authorities, may carry out on-the-spot checks and audits. They have the same inspection powers in non-EU countries.   If a serious risk is identified, national authorities must take every measure necessary to safeguard the health of the animals.   Imports   must comply with EU animal health rules;   may only come from countries which prove they meet these requirements;   must be accompanied by a veterinary certificate.      Repeal   Directive  2002/99/EC  will be repealed and replaced by  Regulation (EU) 2016/429  from 2 April 2021.   from when does the directive apply  It applies since 12 February 2003. EU countries had to incorporate it into their national law by 31 December 2004.   background   The EU has taken specific measures against the following animal diseases:    Classical Swine Fever     African Swine Fever     African horse sickness     Foot-and-mouth disease     Avian influenza     Blue tongue     Newcastle disease     Aquaculture diseases     Other diseases  .

summary of   Decision 2001/539/EC on the conclusion by the European Community of the Montreal Convention    Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air (the Montreal Convention)   what is the aim of the convention and of the decision   The convention aims to introduce uniform legal rules to govern air carrier liability in the event of damage caused to passengers, baggage or goods during international journeys.   The decision concludes the convention on behalf of the European Community (now the EU).   key points   The convention introduces comprehensive legal principles and rules the most important of which are:   the principle of an air carrier’s unlimited civil liability in the event of bodily injury; this splits into two tiers:   a  first tier of strict carrier liability  for damages of up to 100,000 SDRs (special drawing rights, as defined by the  International Monetary Fund  , i.e. around €120,000);   in excess of that amount, a  second tier of liability  based on the presumed fault of the carrier, which the latter may avoid only by proving that it was not at fault (the burden of proof is on the carrier);     the principle of making  advance payments  , in the event of bodily injury, to enable victims or the persons entitled to compensation to cover their immediate economic needs;   the possibility for the victim, or the persons entitled to compensation, to bring suits before the courts in the passenger’s principal place of residence;   an increase in the air carrier’s liability limits in the event of delay, and in the event of damage caused to baggage (delay, loss or damage);   modernisation of transport documents (electronic airway bills and tickets);   clarification of the rules on the respective liability of the contracting carrier (the air carrier whose name or code is on the air ticket) and the actual carrier (the carrier performing the flight may not be the same as the contracting air carrier);   generalised institution of the obligation for air carriers to maintain adequate insurance;   introduction of the so-called ‘regional’ clause allowing economic integration organisations, such as the EU, to accede to the convention.   In 1997, the EU adopted Regulation (EC) No 2027/97 (on  air carrier liability in the event of accidents  ) which imposes unlimited liability on EU air carriers in the event of death or injury to passengers.  Regulation (EC) No 889/2002  amends Regulation (EC) No 2027/97 and applies the rules of the Montreal Convention to all flights, whether domestic or international, operated by EU air carriers.   from when do the convention and the decision apply  The Montreal Convention entered into force on 4 November 2003. The decision has applied since 5 April 2001.   background   The inadequacy of the 1929  Warsaw Convention  , which governed air carriers’ liability for death and injury, and of its subsequent revisions led to the need to modernise and unify the rules on liability.  In May 1999, the Contracting States of the  International Civil Aviation Organisation  negotiated an agreement to modernise the Warsaw Convention rules, adapting them into a single legal instrument offering an appropriate level of compensation in the event of damage caused to passengers during international air transport.

summary of   Directive 2005/35/EC on ship-source pollution and on the introduction of penalties for infringements   summary    what does this directive do   It creates rules that are applicable EU-wide on the imposition of penalties in the event of discharges of oil or other polluting substances from ships sailing in its waters.   key points    The current legislation states that ship-source polluting discharges constitute  in principle a criminal offence  . According to the directive, this relates to discharges of oil or other polluting substances from vessels. Minor discharges are not automatically considered as offences, except where repeated discharges lead to a deterioration in water quality.   The  persons responsible  for discharging polluting substances may be subject to criminal penalties, if they have acted with intent, recklessly* or with serious negligence. The act of inciting or aiding and abetting a person to discharge a polluting substance may also lead to criminal penalties.   The directive applies to all types of vessels, irrespective of their flag.    Polluting discharges  are forbidden in:   the internal waters, including ports, of an EU country;   the territorial waters of an EU country;   straits used for international navigation subject to the right of transit passage, as laid down in the  1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  ;   the exclusive economic zone (EEZ)* of an EU country;   the high seas.      Exceptions    This regime does not apply to discharges from warships or other ships owned or operated by a state and used only on government non-commercial service.   Exceptions to the ban on discharges of polluting substances may be applied where human safety or that of the ship is in danger.    Legal persons   Directive  2009/123/EC  amended Directive 2005/35/EC to improve rules on ship-source pollution and to ensure that those responsible for discharges of polluting substances are subject to adequate penalties. It requires EU countries to introduce rules on the liability of legal persons under private law* such as companies.   Companies may be subject to criminal penalties if an individual in a leading position within the company has committed a criminal offence for their benefit, whether this person has acted either individually or as part of the company.   The company is also responsible for offences committed by an individual through oversight, specifically through a lack of supervision or control.   The liability of the company must not exclude criminal proceedings against the individuals involved.    Applying penalties   Directive 2009/123/EC also requires EU countries’ national authorities to ensure that effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties are applied, including for minor cases. They must cooperate when a vessel is found guilty of illegal discharging in their area of responsibility before the vessels calls at the port of another EU country.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 1 October 2005. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 1 April 2007.   background   The sinking of the Prestige in November 2002 and of the Erika in December 1999 highlighted the need to tighten the net in relation to ship-source pollution. However, accidents are not the main source of pollution: most of it is the result of deliberate discharges (tank-cleaning operations and waste oil disposal).  These rules incorporate into EU law parts of the  1973 International Convention on the Prevention of Pollution from Ships  and its 1978 Protocol (known as the Marpol Convention). This makes it possible to harmonise application of the rules of this convention.   key terms    * Reckless action  : action taken with the knowledge that it is likely to result in damage.   * Exclusive economic zone (EEZ)  : it is generally understood to arise when a country assumes jurisdiction over the exploration and exploitation of marine resources off its coast. This section is normally considered to be a band extending 200 miles from the shore.   * Legal persons under private law  : all legal entities, such as companies, with the exception of states, public bodies and international public organisations.   acts   Directive  2005/35/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on ship-source pollution and on the introduction of penalties for infringements (OJ L 255, 30.9.2005, pp. 11–21).  Successive amendments to Directive 2005/35/CE have been incorporated in the basic text. This  consolidated version  is of documentary value only.
   Improved effectiveness, enhanced interoperability and synergies between European databases     Improved effectiveness, enhanced interoperability and synergies between European databases     This Communication focuses on the three main IT systems currently at the European Union's disposal: SIS II, VIS and EURODAC. After briefly describing their characteristics and objectives, it reviews how each system is working. It then suggests a variety of ways in which they could be used more effectively and how other systems might be established. Lastly, it examines whether these possibilities are proportionate and compatible with the priority of protecting human rights.     ACT     Commission Communication of 24 November 2005 on improved effectiveness, enhanced interoperability and synergies among European databases in the area of Justice and Home Affairs [       COM(2005) 597      final - not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This Communication is the Commission's response to the invitations of the European Council and the Council of the European Union to submit proposals for improving effectiveness and enhancing interoperability and synergy among European databases. The need to make greater use of biometrics in this field has also been stressed.     The main objectives of this Communication are:      to improve technical interoperability and synergy between the existing IT systems (SIS II, VIS, EURODAC) in the field of justice and home affairs;       to show how these systems could support policies on free movement and combating terrorism and crime, while respecting the need to protect fundamental rights;       to trigger in-depth debate on the shape and architecture of the IT systems.       Definitions of terms used      Interoperability is the "ability of IT systems and of the business processes they support to exchange data and to enable the sharing of information and knowledge."     Connectivity is a term for connecting devices in order to transfer data.     Synergy has different meanings, depending on whether one is speaking in technical, economic or organisational terms. In technical terms it means a mutually advantageous conjunction of several elements. Economically, it means an increase in the value of assets or an economy of scale. Organisationally, it means combining previously distinct resources or streamlining the existing organisation to achieve greater efficiency.     Availability refers to the principle whereby the Member State authorities responsible for security or Europol officials should obtain the information they need from another Member State if it is accessible there.      SIS II, VIS and EURODAC: status and purpose      The second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) should make it possible to combine freedom of movement and security within the EU and to improve the exchange of information between Member States. The information will be used for controls of persons (at external borders or on national territory) and for the issue of visas and residence permits, as well as for police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters.     The main purposes of the visa Information System (VIS) are:      to improve visa issuing procedures;       to administer the common visa policy;       to improve consular cooperation to prevent threats to internal security and "visa shopping"         *        ;       to facilitate the fight against fraud;       to assist in the identification and return of illegal immigrants;       to facilitate the application of the         Dublin II        Regulation.      The purpose of       EURODAC      , the cornerstone of the EU's asylum arrangements, is to assist in determining which Member State is responsible for examining an asylum application under the Dublin II Regulation and to facilitate application of that Regulation.      Combating terrorism and crime: shortcomings identified      At present, not all the potential of the existing systems is exploited, particularly in terms of data processing and exchange.     The limitation to alphanumeric searches       *      , which are less precise the more data the base contains, call for many people to be involved in verifying jobs, which is not always possible in the context of border controls.     Bona fide and frequent travellers generally find that their chances of speeding up the processing of a Schengen visa application are limited. Moreover, if their travel documents are lost or stolen, they are too often required to go through a complicated process to acquire new ones.     It is also difficult to identify illegal immigrants. As they generally have no ID or use counterfeit or falsified documents, the identification process is often long and costly. If travel documents have been destroyed, the authorities currently have no system for checking identity.     There is a problem with applying the Dublin II Regulation in that Member States do not currently have any efficient means of checking whether an asylum applicant has had a visa issued by another Member State, verifying the identity of the person, or determining the validity of the visa.     The fact that asylum, immigration and visa data cannot be used for internal security purposes is an obstacle to the effective operation of the existing IT systems.     Checks on identity and legal entry need to be extended to all categories of non-EU nationals, whereas at present only non-EU nationals subject to visa applications are subject to these checks.     Monitoring of the entry and exit of non-EU nationals is incomplete. As VIS (like SIS II) keeps no records of entries and exits, it does not help to identify persons who are residing illegally on EU territory.     In the context of the fight against terrorism and crime, the absence of biometric identification tools is a severe handicap.     The current system has limitations in dealing with the problem of identity theft in the absence of registration of citizens at EU level.     Lastly, there is no comprehensive database that would allow for the identification of disaster victims and unidentified bodies. It has been suggested that the Interpol database might be used, although this would not cover all cases.      Possible developments      To remedy these shortcomings effectively, it is essential to improve use of the existing systems through:      better quality control of data input;       more coherence as regards input of data categories;       greater user-friendliness;       wider and more direct consultation of Member States;       exchange of best practices.      Further effective development of existing and planned systems must also be promoted at three separate levels:      biometric searches in SIS II;       more comprehensive access to VIS and SIS II for asylum and immigration authorities;       more comprehensive access to the various IT systems for the internal security authorities.      In the longer term it is also planned to:      create a European criminal Automated Fingerprints Identification System (AFIS)       establish an entry-exit system and introduce a border-crossing facilitation scheme for frequent border crossers;       develop one or more EU registers of travel and ID documents.      These developments will inevitably entail changes in the architecture and organisation of the EU's IT systems. Firstly, changes to produce an essentially service-oriented architecture, for two reasons:      in order to maximise synergies while containing investment at a realistic level;       and to allow functions to be shared in a flexible and cost-efficient way without having to merge existing systems.      At organisational level, bringing daily management activities within a single organisation would also bring about further synergy effects.      Human rights: data protection      In terms of the compatibility between better identification of wanted persons and the protection of personal data, the principle of proportionality requires that the internal security authorities should consult the databases of the various IT systems (EURODAC, SIS II immigration data, VIS) only if the offence committed by the criminal or terrorist to be identified is serious enough to justify searching a database where people with clean criminal records are registered.     As far as the comparison of DNA profiles is concerned, the limitation to a hit/no hit check against the DNA profile alone, without any other personal information, allows the principle of proportionality to be fully respected. The creation of an EU register of travel and identity documents should only be envisaged if access to the register is strictly limited and searching it must be justified by an imperative public security interest.     All the possible measures must be closely supervised by the competent data protection bodies, and in any case, when making any proposals on these subjects the Commission will carry out specific impact studies on respect for fundamental rights in accordance with Communication       COM(2005) 172      .

   Exit taxation and the need for co-ordination of Member States' tax policies     Exit taxation and the need for co-ordination of Member States' tax policies     In this Communication, the Commission proposes ways for Member States to co-ordinate their rules on exit taxation in order to eliminate discrimination and double taxation. The Communication focuses on capital gains accrued when taxpayers move from one Member State to another before selling their assets or when taxpayers transfer their headquarters or assets to another Member State.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee - Exit taxation and the need for co-ordination of Member States' tax policies [       COM(2006) 825      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     In the framework of an EU-coordinated approach in the field of       direct taxation      , the European Commission invites Member States to better coordinate their national rules on exit tax.     Exit taxes are levied by many Member States on accrued capital gains when taxpayers move their residence or transfer individual assets to another Member State. The Communication examines how Member States' exit tax rules on individuals and companies can be made compatible with the requirements of EC law. It also gives guidance on how to make such national rules compatible with each other with a view to removing double taxation or inadvertent non-taxation and preventing abuse and tax base erosion.      Background      Many Member States seek to tax their resident individual and/or corporate taxpayers on capital gains in respect of their assets. In domestic situations, such capital gains will usually be taxed when they are realised, that is when the assets are sold or otherwise disposed of. However, if an individual taxpayer moves to another Member State before selling his assets, his original home state risks losing the right to tax the capital gains which have accrued on those assets. Similarly, if a company transfers its headquarters to another Member State or transfers individual assets to a branch (permanent establishment) in another Member State (or vice versa), the original home state risks the (partial) loss of right to tax the gains which have accrued while the company was resident in its territory. Many Member States have attempted to deal with this issue by taxing such accrued but as yet unrealised capital gains at the moment of transfer of the residence by the taxpayer or of the individual assets to another Member State.     The European Court of Justice has already ruled that immediate taxation of latent capital gains on assets transferred to another Member State infringes the principle of freedom of establishment. Indeed, taxpayers will be discriminated by being subject to immediate taxation in their Member State of origin on capital gains not yet realised if no such taxation occurs in similar domestic situations. The Court has also stated that Member States cannot put a disproportionate burden on the taxpayer, such as by imposing bank guarantees or the obligation to appoint a fiscal representative that would guarantee the payment of the tax when the asset is realised in the new home Member State.     However, EC law does not prevent a Member State from assessing the amount of income on which it wishes to preserve its tax jurisdiction, provided this does not give rise to an immediate tax charge and there are no further conditions attached to such deferral, and due account is taken of any reduction in value of the assets after the transfer. Member States should therefore provide for an unconditional deferral of collection of the tax due until the moment of actual realisation.      Removing remaining tax obstacles      Although granting an unconditional deferral may resolve the immediate difference in treatment between taxpayers who move to another Member State and those who remain in the same Member State, it will not necessarily provide a solution for double taxation or inadvertent non-taxation which may arise due to discrepancies between the different national rules. Double taxation could arise if the exit State calculates the capital gain at the moment of deemed disposal at the time the taxpayer leaves the country and the new State of residence taxes the whole capital gain from the acquisition up to the moment of actual disposal. Similarly, in the case of companies, differing asset valuation methods between Member States can give rise to double taxation or inadvertent non-taxation.     Effective administrative cooperation will be key to ensuring the effective protection of the exit State tax base. The new Member State of residence will need to inform the exit State of any future realisation of the assets.     The Communication expresses the Commission's readiness to assist Member States in developing guidance to remove discrimination and double taxation and, at the same time, prevent inadvertent non-taxation, abuse and tax base erosion.

summary of   Commission Regulation (EC) No 2023/2006 — good manufacturing practice for materials and articles intended to come into contact with food   summary    what does the regulation do  It lays down rules on good manufacturing practice (GMP)* for materials and articles that come into contact with food.   key points    The legislation applies to all sectors and all stages of manufacture, processing and distribution of materials and articles.   Businesses must:   conform with good manufacturing practice;   establish, implement and apply an effective and documented quality assurance system*;   establish and maintain an effective quality control system;   establish and maintain appropriate records, either in paper or electronic form, on specifications, formulae and processing on the safety of the individual product and the various manufacturing operations.     Good manufacturing practice covers objects such as containers, packaging, paper, cardboard, ink and adhesives which could come into contact with food.   Quality assurance systems take account of:   the staff’s knowledge and skills and the organisation of the premises and equipment;   the size of the business to prevent them being an excessive burden.     Quality control systems include:   monitoring the implementation of good manufacturing practice; and   identifying and correcting any measures that fall short of the required standards.     An amendment (  Regulation (EC) No 282/2008  ) sets out a specific quality assurance system for recycled plastic materials and articles that come into contact with food.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 1 August 2008.   key terms    * Good manufacturing practice  : those aspects of quality assurance that ensure materials and articles conform to quality standards, do not endanger human health or cause an unacceptable change in the composition of the food.   * Quality assurance system  : organised and documented arrangements that ensure materials and articles meet the quality required.   act   Commission Regulation (EC) No  2023/2006  of 22 December 2006 on good manufacturing practice for materials and articles intended to come into contact with food (OJ L 384, 29.12.2006, pp. 75-78)  Subsequent amendments to Regulation (EC) No 2023/2006 have been incorporated into the basic text.

summary of   Directive (EU) 2016/800 on procedural safeguards for children who are suspects or accused persons in criminal proceedings   what is the aim of the directive   It establishes procedural safeguards  *  for children  *  who are suspected or accused of a criminal offence. The safeguards are in addition to those which apply to suspected or accused adults.   It is the fifth in a series of measures to establish minimum rules for procedural rights across the European Union (EU) in accordance with a  2009 Roadmap  .   key points   The key elements of the directive are that children have the  right of access to a lawyer  and the  right to be assisted by a lawyer.  The assistance by a lawyer is mandatory when they are brought before a court to decide on pre-trial detention and when they are in detention. A child who has not been assisted by a lawyer during the court hearings cannot be sentenced to prison.  EU countries must also ensure that deprivation of liberty, and in particular detention, is imposed on children only as a last resort and for the shortest appropriate period. Children who are detained should be held separately from adults, unless it is considered to be in the child’s best interest not to do so.  The directive also includes  other safeguards  , such as the right to:   be promptly informed about their rights and about general aspects of the conduct of the proceedings;   have information provided to a parent or another appropriate adult;   be accompanied by that person during court hearings and at other stages of the proceedings;   an individual assessment by qualified personnel;   a medical examination if the child is deprived of liberty;   protection of privacy during criminal proceedings;   appear in person at trial;   effective remedies  *  .   Judges, prosecutors and other professionals who deal with criminal proceedings involving children should have a specific competence or access to specific training.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 10 June 2016. EU countries have to incorporate it into national legislation by 11 June 2019.   background   For more information, see:    ‘Rights of suspects and accused’  on the European Commission's website    Press release  on the European Commission's website.   * key terms     Procedural safeguards:  in this case, safeguards that ensure that children are provided with the necessary information to understand how the procedure works and their legal rights.     Children:  people below the age of 18.     Effective remedies:  the means by which a court enforces a right, imposes a penalty, or makes another court order to impose its will.
summary of   Regulation (EC) No 549/2004 laying down the framework for the creation of the single European sky (the framework Regulation)   what is the aim of the regulation   It is part of a package of legislation on air traffic management designed to establish a  single European sky  to ensure the optimal use of European airspace to meet the requirements of all airspace users.   This regulation aims to:   improve current safety standards and overall efficiency for general air traffic in Europe;   optimise capacity; and   minimise delays.     The regulation was amended by Regulation (EC) No  1070/2009  in view of the plan to extend the responsibilities of the  European Union Aviation Safety Agency  to include air traffic management safety. This amendment permits the  European Commission  to update legislation in line with to technical or operational developments, as well as to lay down the basic criteria and procedures for using certain network management functions.   key points    National supervisory authorities    EU countries must, jointly or individually, nominate or establish one or more bodies as their national supervisory authorities to perform the tasks assigned to such authorities by the regulation.   These authorities must be independent of air navigation service providers.    Single Sky Committee    A Single Sky Committee is set up to assist the Commission with managing the single European sky and to ensure that due account is taken of the interests of all categories of users.   It consists of 2 representatives of each EU country and is chaired by a representative of the Commission.    Implementing rules    Eurocontrol  is involved in the development of implementing rules which fall within its remit, on the basis of mandates agreed by the Single Sky Committee.   Performance review   The regulation introduces a performance review mechanism for air navigation services and network functions. This includes:   EU-wide performance targets on the key performance areas of safety, the environment, capacity and cost-efficiency;   national plans or plans for  functional airspace blocks   *  ensuring consistency with the EU-wide targets; and   periodic review, monitoring and benchmarking of the performance of air navigation services and network functions.   Commission Implementing Regulation (EU)  2019/317  lays down the rules for operating the performance scheme for air navigation services and network functions, and those relating to the charging scheme referred to in Regulation (EC) No  550/2004  on air navigation services — see  summary  .   Safeguards   This regulation does not prevent EU countries from applying measures needed to safeguard essential security or defence policy interests.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 20 April 2004.   background   The first ‘Single European sky’ package consists of this framework regulation plus 3 technical regulations on the  provision of air navigation services  (Regulation (EC) No  550/2004  ),  organisation and use of the airspace  (Regulation (EC) No  551/2004  ) and the  interoperability of the European air traffic management network  (now under Regulation (EU)  2018/1139  or other related delegated or implementing regulations which repealed and replaced Regulation (EC) No  552/2004  ). These regulations are designed, in particular, to improve and reinforce safety and to reorganise the airspace on the basis of traffic instead of national borders.  For more information, see:    Single European Sky  (  European Commission  )   key terms    Functional airspace block:  an airspace block based on operational requirements rather than national borders, where air navigation and related services are performance-driven and optimised in order to introduce, in each functional airspace block, enhanced cooperation among air navigation service providers or, where appropriate, an integrated provider.
   Interinstitutional Agreement on cooperation in budgetary matters     Interinstitutional Agreement on cooperation in budgetary matters     The Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management, concluded between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on 17 May 2006, contains the financial framework for 2007-13 and aims to implement budgetary discipline. Its purpose is also to improve the functioning of the annual budgetary procedure and cooperation between the institutions in budgetary matters.     ACT      Interinstitutional Agreement      between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     The Agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management (IIA) was concluded between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. It concerns the drafting and implemention of the European Union (EU) budget. Through this agreement, the European institutions have decided to organise their cooperation in order to improve the functioning of the budgetary procedure and to ensure the sound financial management of European finances.     The IIA comprises three sections:      Part I establishes the financial framework for the 2007-2013 period, specifically the amounts of expenditure for each policy area;       Part II organises the cooperation between the Parliament, the Council and the Commission during the budgetary procedure;       Part III establishes the rules aimed at ensuring sound financial management of EU funds.       Financial framework 2007-2013      The financial framework is intended to ensure that EU expenditure develops in an orderly manner for a given period. For each of the years from 2007 to 2013, the financial framework sets       ceilings      for each category of expenditure. The European institutions undertake to use their budgetary powers in such a way as to comply with these ceilings.     The financial framework table for the 2007-2013 period is provided in Annex I to the IIA. The ceilings are set within the limits of the EU’s       own resources      .     Furthermore, the financial framework may be subject to       technical adjustments      by the Commission. For example, these adjustments consist of revaluations of the ceilings depending on price development and the conditions of implementation of the budget.     The financial framework may also be subject to       revision      in response to any initially unforeseen circumstances, with due regard to the own resources ceiling. Any Commission proposal for such revision should be presented and adopted before the start of the budget procedure of the financial year (or the first of the series of financial years) concerned.     Furthermore, the IIA lays down rules for mobilising certain instruments outside of the financial framework:       Emergency aid reserve:        this reserve is designed to respond to the specific aid requirements of third countries following events which could not be foreseen when the budget was established. The annual amount of the reserve is fixed at EUR 221 million for the duration of the financial framework;        Solidarity Fund:        the EU         Solidarity Fund        is intended to allow swift financial assistance in the event of major disasters occurring on the territory of a Member State or of a candidate country. There will be a ceiling on the annual amount available for the Solidarity Fund of EUR 1 billion;        Flexibility instrument:        the flexibility instrument with an annual ceiling of EUR 200 million is intended to allow financing of expenditure which could not be financed within the limits of the ceilings available for one or more other headings;        European Globalisation Adjustment Fund:        the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is intended to provide additional support for workers suffering from the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns, to assist them with their reintegration into the labour market. The maximum annual amount allocated to the Fund is EUR 500 million.       Interinstitutional cooperation during the budgetary procedure      The Interinstitutional Agreement lays down the procedures and details for interinstitutional cooperation in budgetary matters as regards:      establishing the budget;       classifying expenditure;       the maximum rate of increase for non-compulsory expenditure in the absence of a financial framework;       incorporating financial provisions into legislative acts;       expenditure related to fisheries agreements;       financing the common foreign and security policy (CFSP).       Sound financial management      The institutions shall ensure that this Agreement and the budget are implemented in a context of sound financial management based on the principles of economy, efficiency, protection of financial interests, proportionality of administrative costs, and user-friendly procedures.     Furthermore, the Commission will submit twice a year a financial programme structured by heading, policy area and budget line. This financial programme shall be closely connected to the Commission’s legislative programme.     Furthermore, the Parliament, the Council and the Commission commit to strengthening internal control without adding to the administrative burden. The Institutions plan to include provisions to this end in the legislative acts concerned.     Finally, the Institutions also commit to encouraging the introduction of co-financing mechanisms based on public and private investment. The aim is to take advantage of the leverage effect of the EU budget.      Context      The Lisbon Treaty, which entered into force on 1 December 2009, introduced new provisions relating to the EU budget.     Article 312 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU specifies that the multi-annual financial framework shall henceforth be the subject of a Council Regulation, adopted unanimously and following approval by the Parliament.     Furthermore, the procedure for adopting the budget has also been revised. The role of the Parliament in particular has been strengthened and the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure has been removed.     The changes introduced by the Lisbon Treaty therefore require the current interinstitutional agreement to be revised. Two legislative proposals are currently being adopted at European level:       Proposal        for a Council Regulation laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2007-2013;       a         draft        interinstitutional agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on cooperation in budgetary matters.

   The European Indicator of Language Competence     The European Indicator of Language Competence     This Communication follows on from the Barcelona European Council of March 2002, which had called for the establishment of a linguistic competence indicator. The ultimate aim is to provide Member States with hard data and comparisons on which any necessary adjustments in their approach to foreign language teaching and learning can be based. This Communication sets out parameters and management arrangements for implementing the Indicator.     ACT     Commission Communication of 1 August 2005 - The European Indicator of Language Competence [       COM(2005) 356      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Progress towards the objective of ensuring that all pupils learn at least two foreign languages from an early age can only be measured using reliable data on the results of foreign language teaching and learning.     At the meeting of the European Council in Barcelona in March 2002, the Heads of State or Government called for the establishment of a linguistic competence indicator. The Commission undertook this task on a consensual basis with Member States' representatives, involving the Expert Working Groups on Languages and on Indicators and Benchmarks.      PARAMETERS       Objectives      The purpose of the indicator is to measure foreign language skills in each Member State.      Method      The Commission proposes to give specially developed tests of competence to a sample of pupils in education and training establishments in all the Member States. The tests will be devised in the light of the results of previous projects in this field.      Target group      The data for the indicator should be gathered from pupils at the end of compulsory education or training, and it is therefore proposed to target 15-year-olds.      Scale      The indicator ought to record the proficiency of the sample at the six levels of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.      Languages      The Commission proposes that in the first instance, and for practical reasons, foreign language competence should be tested in the five languages most frequently taught in the Union as a whole (English, French, German, Spanish and Italian). Experience gained during the first cycle of tests should permit a wider range of languages to be tested in subsequent cycles.      Skills      The indicator should measure four linguistic skills:      reading;       listening;       speaking;       writing.      It may be (again for practical reasons) that oral skills would not be tested during the first cycle.      Other data      Often, linguistic competence is affected by factors outside the education system (languages on TV, the home environment) as well as factors within the system (experience of the teacher, total number of hours of language classes). Tests should therefore be supplemented by questionnaires aimed at teachers and pupils with a view to gathering contextual information.      MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS       Cooperation      The Commission will attend to the central coordination of the process and analysis of the data collected, with external support provided through a contract awarded under normal tendering procedures.      Advisory Board      It will be necessary to create a body whose members will be instructed by the Member States to advise the Commission on political and technical aspects, and to report on the progress made in implementing the indicator in their country. Current groups of experts do not have a sufficient mandate or the necessary technical expertise in language testing or the development of indicators to do this.     Consequently, the Commission proposes to establish an Advisory Board consisting of representatives of the Member States (the "EILC Advisory Board") with the following role:      advising the Commission on the specification of the tender for creation of the testing instruments and on the criteria for selection of the tenderer;       advising the Commission on the assessment of the contractor's work;       advising on the collection of data in the Member States;       securing good progress on implementation in the Member States;       evaluating the results.      The specific activities necessary for gathering data will be carried out by the Member States, with due regard to the procedures and standards laid down by the Commission on the advice of the Advisory Board. These activities will entail:      organising the participation of a sample of institutions;       distributing the testing material to invigilators and making practical arrangements for the tests to take place;       collecting the responses and arranging for them to be marked according to the central standards;       passing the resultant data to the central coordinator.       Resources needed      The appropriate resources have been approved within the budgets of the       Socrates      and       Leonardo da Vinci      programmes for 2005.      TIMETABLE      The Commission hopes to convene the first meeting of the EILC Advisory Board before the end of 2005, to publish the invitation to tender for central coordination of the indicator in spring 2006, and to organise a first pilot exercise to try out the proposed testing instruments in 2007.     The Commission invites the Council to express its agreement with the approach outlined in this Communication.      BACKGROUND      The Heads of State and Government, at their meeting in Barcelona in March 2002, set the objective of making the European Union's education and training systems a world quality reference by 2010. They called for "action to improve the mastery of basic skills, in particular by teaching at least two foreign languages from a very early age", and also for "the establishment of a linguistic competence indicator in 2003". This decision arose from the current lack of data on the actual language skills of people in the European Union and the need for a reliable system to measure the progress achieved.     The action plan "       Promoting Language Learning and Linguistic Diversity      " commits the Commission to introducing such an indicator.     This indicator ties in with a number of other indicators that the Member States have decided to develop through the "       Education and Training 2010      " process.

summary of   Article 13 of the Treaty on European Union   what is the aim of this treaty article    Article 13  of the Treaty on European Union (EU) lists the EU's institutions and states that they must practice ‘mutual sincere cooperation’.   key points    The EU’s various institutions must aim to:   promote the EU’s values (respect for human dignity, liberty, democracy,  equality  , the  rule of law  and  human rights  , including the rights of persons belonging to minorities);   advance the EU’s objectives (the main ones being promoting peace, the EU’s values and the well-being of its citizens);   serve the interests of the EU, the general public and EU countries;   ensure the consistency, effectiveness and continuity of EU policies and activities.     The institutions are:   the  European Parliament  ;   the  European Council  ;   the  Council  ;   the  European Commission  ;   the  Court of Justice of the European Union  ;   the  European Central Bank (ECB)  ;   the  Court of Auditors  .     Each institution operates within its own treaty powers, procedures and objectives and must cooperate with the others.   The Parliament, Council and Commission cooperate closely among themselves and, under  Article 295  of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), may conclude  interinstitutional agreements  . Examples of such agreements include:    better law-making  ;    rules of conduct for European lobbyists and civil servants  ;    budget discipline and sound financial management  .     How the EU institutions work together may also be determined by other treaty articles such as the following:    Article 284  of the TFEU, which governs relations between the Council and the ECB. Under this article, the ECB president must be invited to participate in Council meetings when the bank’s objectives and tasks are on the agenda. The ECB’s annual report must be sent to the Parliament, the Council and the Commission, as well as to the European Council.    Article 134  of the TFEU, according to which EU countries, the Commission and the ECB work together in the context of the  Economic and Financial Committee  .     However, how the institutions work and interact is also determined by:   practices that have evolved over the years;   the institutions’ respective rules of procedure; and   on a case-by-case basis, as in the case of an  agreement  between the ECB and the European Parliament on accountability and transparency in regard to European banking supervision. The conclusion of this agreement was specifically written into Article 20(8) of Regulation (EU) No  1024/2013  on the ECB’s tasks relating to prudential supervision of credit institutions.     main documents    Article 13  of the Treaty on European Union (OJ C 202, 7.6.2016, p. 22)
summary of   Directive 2002/92/EC — insurance mediation   what is the aim of the directive   The insurance mediation directive regulates the selling practices of all insurance products by agents and brokers.   It covers the regulation of general insurance products, such as motor insurance, as well as life insurance policies, including those which contain investment elements, such as unit-linked life insurance products  *  .   key points    All individuals or companies who carry out insurance or reinsurance  *  mediation must be  registered in their home EU country  on the basis of a number of specific minimum requirements including:   possession of appropriate knowledge and ability as determined by the relevant laws of their EU country,   being of good repute,   possession of professional indemnity insurance or any other comparable guarantee against liability arising out of professional negligence,   sufficient financial capacity to protect customers against any failure by the intermediary to transfer customers’ premiums to insurance companies or to pass on to customers money received for claims under the policies they hold.     EU countries may adopt  stricter rules  , but only for agents and brokers registered on their territory.   On the basis of their  registration in their home country  , insurance or reinsurance intermediaries will be able to do business in other EU countries.   Insurance intermediaries are  required to give customers clear explanations for the advice  they give on which products to buy. They must specify accurately and clearly in writing to the customer why they have recommended particular products in the light of the customer’s individual requirements.   EU countries must provide easy public access through a  single information point  to details of registered insurance and reinsurance intermediaries, the relevant EU country authorities with which they are registered and the EU countries in which they conduct business.   The directive encourages EU countries to establish appropriate and effective  alternative dispute resolution procedures  for out-of-court redress for dissatisfied customers, in particular via the  FIN-NET  network.   On 20 January 2016, the  European Parliament  and the  Council  adopted the  insurance distribution directive  (Directive (EU) 2016/97), which updates and replaces the insurance mediation directive. The new directive will cover the entire distribution chain, including insurers that sell directly to consumers (hence the new name). It will also further improve the way insurance products are sold including greater price transparency and better information for consumers.   from when does the directive apply   Directive 2002/92/EC entered into force on 15 January 2003. EU countries had to incorporate it into their national law by 14 January 2005.   Directive (EU) 2016/97 on insurance distribution (recast) entered into force on 22 February 2016. EU countries will have to incorporate the directive into their national law by 23 February 2018.   background   More information available on the European Commission’s  insurance mediation  website.   * key terms     Unit-linked life insurance products:  these give life insurance policy-holders the possibility of combining their money with that of other policy-holders in a unit-linked fund. This allows them to invest in a wider spread of investments (such as stocks and bonds) than they could on their own.     Reinsurance:  where insurers transfer parts of their risk portfolio to other insurers so that they can spread the risk of having to pay out large amounts in the event of a claim.
   "Audiovisual media services without frontiers" Directive     "Audiovisual media services without frontiers" Directive     The revision of the "Television without frontiers" (TVWF) Directive aims to adapt and modernise the existing rules. The main objective of this revision is to take account of technological developments and changes in the structure of the audiovisual market. A further objective is to ease the regulatory burden on providers of audiovisual services while facilitating the financing of European audiovisual content.     ACT     Directive       2007/65/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2007 amending Council Directive       89/552/EC      on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities.     SUMMARY     The purpose of the "Audiovisual media services" Directive is to revise the "       Television without frontiers      " (TVWF) Directive adopted in 1989 and first amended in 1997. The aim is to achieve a modern, flexible and simplified framework for audiovisual media content.     The revision proposed by the Commission is based on a new definition of audiovisual media services, which is independent of the method of broadcasting.      Distinction between "linear" and "non-linear" services      The new Directive defines the notion of "audiovisual media services" by making a distinction between:      linear services         *        , which are traditional television services, the Internet and mobile telephone services, which "push" content to viewers, and;       non-linear services         *        , i.e. on-demand television, where viewers "pull" content from a network ("video-on-demand", for example).      In accordance with this distinction, the Directive:      modernises and simplifies the regulatory framework for linear services;       introduces basic rules for non-linear services, including rules on the         protection of minors        , the prevention of racial hatred and the prohibition of surreptitious advertising         *        .      All these services will benefit from the country of origin principle and will therefore have to comply only with the legal provisions in force in the country in which they are established. Extending the benefits of this principle to non-linear services will create the best conditions for their commercial success.     A new two-stage procedure applies where broadcasters in other Member States are likely to circumvent the stricter rules of the Member State of destination. A dialogue is begun between the two Member States and, where this is unsuccessful, the Commission intervenes in order to assess the compatibility of the measures proposed by the Member State of destination with Community law.      Relaxing the rules on advertising      The Directive simplifies and relaxes the rules on the insertion of advertising, while encouraging self- and co-regulation.     The existing daily limit of three hours of advertising has been abolished. The Commission has retained the limit of 12 minutes per hour for all forms of advertising to prevent an increase in the total amount of advertising broadcast.     In addition, instead of being compelled to allow at least 20 minutes between each advertising break, the new Directive allows broadcasters to choose the most appropriate moment to insert advertising during programmes.     However, cinematographic works, children's programmes and news programmes may be interrupted by advertising only once per 35-minute period.     The Directive provides support for       new forms of advertising      , such as split-screen advertising, virtual advertising and interactive advertising.      A clear legal framework for "product placement"      The Directive explicitly defines "product placement"       *      and establishes a clear legal framework for this. Product placement is the explicit use by characters in a film of a particular brand of product.     The Commission authorises product placement, provided this is specifically identified as such at the beginning of the broadcast. However, product placement is prohibited during news programmes, documentaries and children's programmes.      Pluralism in the media      Three types of measure are provided for, which aim to promote pluralism in the media:      the requirement for each Member State to ensure the independence of the national regulatory body responsible for implementing the Directive;       the right for television broadcasters to use 'short extracts' in a non-discriminatory manner;       the promotion of programmes produced by independent audiovisual production companies in Europe (the previous TVWF Directive already provides for this).       Promotion of cultural diversity      The promotion of cultural diversity is ensured by imposing quotas for media content on broadcasters and other service providers. The Directive currently in force reaffirms the commitment of the EU to support European audiovisual works by allowing Member States to impose quotas on broadcasters in favour of European productions whenever this is possible. These flexible rules on quotas work well and the Member States have no problems meeting the quotas, which have permitted the promotion of independent European productions.      Background      Modernising the legal framework for audiovisual media services is an integral part of the Commission's commitment to "       better regulation      ". It is also part of the "       i2010 - A European Information Society for Growth and Employment      " initiative launched by the Commission in June 2005.       Key terms used in the act         Linear service: an audiovisual media service received passively by the user, such as conventional television programmes, the Internet and mobile telephony ("push" content).         Non-linear service: non-programmed audiovisual media service requested by the user, such as video-on-demand ("pull" content).         Surreptitious advertising: the representation in words or pictures of goods, services, the name, the trade mark or the activities of a producer of goods or a provider of services in programmes when this is intended by the broadcaster to serve advertising purposes and might mislead the public as to its nature. Such representation is considered to be intentional in particular if it is in return for payment or for similar consideration.         Product placement: any inclusion of or reference to a product, a service or a trade mark within an audiovisual media service, normally in return for payment or for similar consideration.

   Fostering structural change: an industrial policy for an enlarged Europe     Fostering structural change: an industrial policy for an enlarged Europe     Industry plays a central role in the European Union's efforts to increase competitiveness and meet the Lisbon objectives. This communication provides an analysis of the competitiveness of European industry and the threat posed by deindustrialisation in this new global environment. The Commission aims to establish an industrial policy tailored to the demands of competitiveness, so as to foster the structural changes required by industry in a knowledge-based Europe.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 20 April 2004 "Fostering structural change: an industrial policy for an enlarged Europe" [       COM(2004) 274      final - not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The Commission intends to set out an industrial policy for the European Union (EU) that matches up to the issues facing Europe, particularly the effects of enlargement and international competition. This policy aims to promote competitiveness and encourage more appropriate regulation, so that European industry remains innovative and continues to create jobs and growth.     The Member States and the European institutions must organise the structural changes in European industry around the factors of production of an enlarged Europe and the innovative capacity of a knowledge-based Europe.      No deindustrialisation but necessary structural change      Although the Commission does not see a general process of deindustrialisation at EU level, structural changes are profoundly affecting the industrial landscape. Jobs and resources in labour-intensive sectors or those facing intense competition are being shifted towards sectors where there are comparative advantages. The impact of these structural changes is positive for the EU as a whole, but may be damaging at local level for certain sectors or regions.     However, these shifts in jobs and resources must be backed by measures to promote research and innovation in order to maintain the EU's comparative advantage in sectors with high added value. The pressure of international competition has intensified in recent years, and is affecting more and more industrial sectors. The relocation of jobs to emerging economies no longer affects only traditional labour-intensive sectors; increasingly, its effects are being felt in hi-tech industries and the services sector. The only way Europe will be able to take full advantage of industrial globalisation is by adopting an industrial policy that focuses on competitiveness.      Opportunities afforded by enlargement      The enlargement of 2004 offers European industry significant opportunities, provided that the restructuring of the relevant sectors is not hampered by national protection measures. On the demand side, the internal market has been extended to include booming national consumer markets. On the supply side, companies can reorganise production to benefit from the competitive advantages of the new Member States.     The new Member States have an important role to play in the transition to a knowledge-based economy. Their inclusion can boost the EU's industrial performance and stimulate the internal market in the face of competition from non-member countries. The competitive advantages of the new Member States should make it possible for jobs that would otherwise have been transferred to Asia to be relocated within the EU. The sectors most affected by the arrival of new companies are food and beverages, transport equipment, base metals and metal products.      Tools to foster structural change      The Commission's objective, in line with the priorities set out in the       2002 communication on industrial policy in an enlarged Europe      , is to rally public stakeholders around three areas of action for fostering change in European industry.     The first area of action concerns regulation and all the laws governing industrial activity in the EU. The aim is to bring legislation into line with the needs of businesses, both at national and European levels. Particular attention should be paid to competitiveness and to analysing the combined effects of different regulations on each sector of activity.     The second goal is to ensure that EU measures in different areas that have an impact on industry, particularly research, competition, employment and regional development, are better coordinated. The Commission intends to use these different policies to improve productivity gains and promote the use of knowledge. In more general terms, greater synergy between the EU's different policy areas will boost the competitiveness of European businesses.     The third target concerns the sectoral dimension of EU industrial policy. The Commission aims to make EU industrial activity more visible in key sectors by involving interested parties, thus highlighting the added value of industrial policy at European level.      Background      This Communication forms part of the debate on how industrial policy can contribute to improving industrial competitiveness, launched by the       Commission's communication of 11 December 2002      . It should help European industry meet the objective the EU set itself at the       2000 European Council in Lisbon      .

   Allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and charging for the use of infrastructure     Allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and charging for the use of infrastructure     The European Union (EU) encourages the establishment of fair and efficient charging systems for the use of infrastructure. Incentives have therefore been introduced to encourage both the optimal use of existing infrastructure and the necessary investment in new infrastructure. Charging systems must also allow for fair competition between different transport modes.     ACT     Directive       2001/14/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2001 on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and safety certification [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     This directive applies to railway infrastructure used for domestic or international rail services.     The following are excluded from its scope:      stand-alone local and regional passenger networks and networks reserved exclusively for urban and suburban passenger services;       privately owned networks reserved solely for use by the owner for its own freight operations;       shuttle services for road vehicles through the Channel Tunnel;       railway transport operations carried out in transit through the Community.      Infrastructure managers must publish a network statement containing the following information in particular:      the nature of the infrastructure which is available to railway undertakings and the conditions for accessing it;       the charging principles, including likely changes over the next five years;       the principles and criteria for capacity allocation (characteristics, restrictions, procedures and deadlines).       Infrastructure charges      Charges are set and collected by an independent charging body, generally the infrastructure manager provided it is not dependent on the railway undertakings.     The directive defines the minimum access package and the mandatory access to services to which railway undertakings are entitled. The undertakings in turn are under an obligation to provide certain mandatory services, to which additional and ancillary services may be added. These are listed in an annex.     The directive lays down charging principles: charges must be paid to the infrastructure managers and used to fund their business. In principle, the charge for the use of railway infrastructure is equal to the cost directly incurred as a result of operating trains. The infrastructure charge may include a sum reflecting the scarcity of capacity. The infrastructure charge may be adjusted to take account of the cost of the environmental impact of operating the trains.     By way of exception to these charging principles, the directive allows infrastructure managers to levy mark-ups, if the market can bear this, on the basis of efficient, transparent and non-discriminatory principles, while guaranteeing optimum competitiveness, especially of international rail freight. Subject to certain conditions, railway undertakings may be granted discounts on charges.     The directive also contains provisions on:      compensation schemes for unpaid environmental, accident and infrastructure costs;       a performance scheme;       capacity reservation charges (for capacity booked but not used).       Allocation of infrastructure capacity      The right to use railway infrastructure is granted by the infrastructure manager concerned. The infrastructure manager also allocates the available capacity which, once allocated, may not be transferred to any other undertaking by the recipient.     The rights and obligations of the infrastructure manager and of the authorised applicants are laid down in a contract. When an applicant intends to use some infrastructure capacity to operate international passenger services, the regulatory bodies ensure that all of the authorities concerned are informed.     Capacity is allocated by an independent body, which may be the infrastructure manager provided it is totally independent of the railway undertakings.     To ensure close collaboration, the directive provides, inter alia, for the establishment of an organisation to coordinate, at international level, the allocation of capacity on different networks. This could include the establishment of international train paths.     A railway undertaking and infrastructure manager may conclude a framework agreement which may not preclude use of the infrastructure by other railway undertakings and may be amended. The agreement will not specify a train path in detail but should meet the commercial needs of the authorised applicant. In principle, the framework agreement covers a period of five years, renewable for a period equal to this original duration. However, for services using specialised infrastructure, the framework agreement may be for a period of 15 years, which may be extended only in exceptional cases.     The directive lays down a schedule for the capacity allocation process and describes how railway undertakings should apply to use infrastructure.     Infrastructure managers must make every effort to meet all requests for capacity and to ensure the best possible matching of all requirements. Save in exceptional cases (specific framework agreements, scarcity of capacity or specialised infrastructure), no priority is given to any service or undertaking within the scheduling and coordination process.     Infrastructure managers unable to meet all the requests for capacity must declare the section in question to be congested. They must then carry out a capacity analysis to determine the restrictions on capacity and propose alternatives.     Within six months of the completion of a capacity analysis, the infrastructure manager must produce a capacity enhancement plan.     Infrastructure managers lay down the conditions concerning use of the train paths. In the case of congested infrastructure, the infrastructure manager may require the surrender of any train path which, over a period of at least one month, has been used less than a threshold quota to be laid down in the network statement.     The directive allows the option of an arbitration procedure in the event of any dispute over the allocation of infrastructure capacity.      Regulatory bodies      Member States must establish a regulatory body which is independent of infrastructure managers, railway undertakings or any other authority involved in the award of a public service contract. Any undertaking which considers that it has been unfairly treated or discriminated against may appeal to this body. The regulatory body is required to remedy the situation on the basis of the information it can obtain from all the parties concerned.     Derogations to this directive are provided for Ireland, Northern Ireland, Greece and Luxembourg.

act   Regulation (EC) No.  450/2008  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2008 laying down the Community Customs Code (Modernised Customs Code) [Official Journal L 145 of 04.06.2008].   summary   The Modernised Customs Code creates a new electronic customs environment. The new Code integrates the common customs procedures in the Member States while reinforcing convergence between the computerised systems of the 28 customs authorities. It replaces the 1992  Customs Community Code  from 1 November 2013.   The Code’s provisions   The 2008 Modernised Customs Code covers:   general provisions on the scope of customs legislation, the mission of customs and the rights and obligations of persons with regard to customs legislation;   factors on the basis of which import and export duties and other measures in respect of trade in goods are applied (  Common Customs Tariff  , origin of goods, value for customs purposes);   customs debt and guarantees of this debt;   customs treatment of goods brought into the customs territory of the Community;   rules on customs status, placing goods under a customs procedure, as well as verification, release and disposal of goods;   release for free circulation and relief from export duties;   special customs procedures organised into four economic functions (transit, storage, specific use, processing);   customs treatment of goods leaving the customs territory of the Community (goods leaving the territory, export and re-export, relief from export duties);   the Customs Code Committee and procedures enabling the Commission to adopt the measures implementing the Code.   New provisions regarding the  streamlining of customs procedures  to facilitate trade and prevent new threats.  Thus through strengthening the common regulatory and operational framework of customs authorities, the Code introduces modern processes based on electronic techniques in order to:   guarantee as a general rule the simplification and uniform application of customs legislation;   improve customs controls, which are based primarily on a risk analysis as part of a common risk management framework. Controls other than customs controls should, wherever possible, be performed at the same time as customs controls at a one-stop-shop;   facilitate clearance procedures, which will be fully computerised, will offer maximum simplifications and can be carried out centrally;   streamline current economic and/or suspensive customs procedures , which have been reorganised into special procedures enabling the transit (external and internal), storage (temporary storage, customs warehousing, free zones), specific use (temporary admission or end-use), and processing (inward or outward processing) of goods to better respond to the economic needs of the operators and to simplify access to them.   Following the 2003  Communication  A simple and paperless environment for customs and trade, the use of  information and communication technologies  has become the rule.  Common information systems enable data exchange between customs authorities and compliance with data-protection provisions. In particular these systems are concerned with:   formalities carried out by economic operators   customs procedures (centralised clearance in particular) and the registration/approval of economic operators (identification and registration of economic operators: EORI; granting of the status of authorised economic operator – customs simplification and/or security and safety: AEO);   risk management through a common framework between the Commission and Member States. This will enable customs authorities to carry out controls based on national, Community and international analyses.    Common system of value added tax   The new legal framework will simplify customs procedures for trade in goods between parts of customs territory of the Community to which Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax applies and parts to which it does not apply.   Context   The Community Customs Code has been modernised following the expiry of the ECSC Treaty and the two successive enlargements of the European Union. Furthermore, it now conforms with the International Convention on the  simplification and harmonisation of customs procedures  , and the  Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union  .

   Compliance with rules on access and benefit-sharing arising from the use of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge     Compliance with rules on access and benefit-sharing arising from the use of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge     SUMMARY OF:      Regulation (EU) No 511/2014 — compliance measures for users of genetic resources and the sharing of benefits arising from their utilisation      WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?     This regulation concerns compliance with rules on access to       genetic resources       *      and       traditional knowledge       *      associated with those genetic resources, and sharing the benefits arising from their use, as set out in the       Nagoya Protocol on access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilisation to the Convention on Biological Diversity      .     The objective of the Nagoya Protocol on       access and benefit-sharing      (ABS) is the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the use of a genetic resource with the country that provided that genetic resource. The benefits generated should contribute to sustainable use and conservation of biodiversity.     The overall objective of the regulation is to ensure that those using genetic resources and associated related traditional knowledge in the       EU      do so in compliance with the ABS legislation of the provider country.     Genetic resources are used for non-commercial and commercial purposes in many sectors such as scientific research, plant breeding, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, the food and feed industry and biotechnology. They are used by universities and companies to do research and/or research and development leading to the commercialisation of products.     KEY POINTS     All countries (including EU countries) have rights over their natural resources and the authority to determine access to their genetic resources.     The challenge faced by provider countries is following up their genetic resource once it leaves the country. An important added value of the Nagoya Protocol is the establishment of       compliance measures      . ‘User’ countries need to take measures to ensure that genetic resources used in their country were accessed in accordance with the ABS rules of the provider country (with prior informed consent obtained and mutually agreed terms established). This information is then transferred back to the provider country. Regulation (EU) No 511/2014 contains the rules governing such compliance measures.     The basic requirement of the regulation is       due diligence      . Users of genetic resources need to seek, keep and transfer to subsequent users a set of information relevant to genetic resources and traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources. If users do not have sufficient information on the legality of access and use, they should obtain a permit, establish mutually agreed terms or stop using the resource.     Users of genetic resources are also obliged to submit a       due diligence declaration      . Filing a due diligence declaration is required at 2 stages in the EU:      at the stage of research funding where such research involves the use of genetic resources and traditional knowledge associated with them;       at the final stage of development of a product.      This means that there are 2 checkpoints in the EU. Information from these checkpoints is transferred to the       ABS Clearing House      (the international IT tool for exchanging information between all relevant actors, established by the Nagoya Protocol) and to the provider countries.     Users must keep information on access to and benefit-sharing of the resource for 20 years after they stop using it.     Each EU country must designate at least 1 authority to be responsible for the implementation of this regulation. This authority receives the due diligence declarations and is responsible for carrying out checks on users.     There are also 2 voluntary tools supporting users’ compliance, a       register of collections      of the EU and a       register of best practices under the terms of the regulation      .     FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?     It has applied since 12 October 2014 with the exception of a few articles which have applied since 12 October 2015.     BACKGROUND     The main international framework for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from using genetic resources is the       1993 Convention on Biological Diversity      (see       summary      ).     The       Nagoya Protocol      , adopted in October 2010, builds on the rules of the convention on access to genetic resources and the sharing of monetary and non-monetary benefits arising from the utilisation of genetic resources.     For more information, see:       Sharing nature’s genetic resources — ABS        (         European Commission        )        Access and benefit-sharing — EU ABS regulation        (         European Commission        ).      KEY TERMS      Genetic resource:      the gene pool part of natural and domesticated or cultivated species that plays a role in many sectors, such as scientific research, food production, health, medicines, cosmetics and bio-based environmental research. It also plays a role in strategies to restore damaged ecosystems and safeguard endangered species.      Traditional knowledge:      knowledge held by indigenous and local communities.

   Europol: European Police Office (until 31.12.2009)     Europol: European Police Office (until 31.12.2009)     This Council act establishes the European Police Office (Europol). The objective of Europol is to improve police cooperation between Member States in order to combat terrorism, unlawful drug trafficking and other serious forms of international organised crime. Member States are setting up national units to liaise between Europol and the national authorities responsible for fighting crime.     ACT     Council Act of 26 July 1995 drawing up the Convention on the establishment of a       European Police Office      (Europol Convention) [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     This act sets up a European Police Office known as Europol. Europol is established in The Hague, Netherlands, with legal personality. The objective of Europol is to improve the effectiveness of, and cooperation between, the competent authorities in Member States in preventing and combating international organised crime.      Strengthening cooperation between Member States: Europol’s role      Unlike the police services of Member States, Europol does not have executive powers. It cannot detain individuals, nor can it conduct home searches. Its tasks are to facilitate the exchanges of information, analyse intelligence and coordinate operations involving several Member States.     As part of police cooperation between Member States, Europol:      facilitates the exchange of information between Member States;       collates and analyses information and intelligence;       notifies the competent authorities of Member States without delay via the national units of information concerning them and of any connections identified between criminal offences;       aids investigations in Member States;       maintains a computerised system of collected information;       helps Member States train their competent authorities;       facilitates technical assistance between Member States;       serves as the contact point for combating         euro counterfeiting        .      Europol takes action when one or two Member States are affected by serious international organised crime. This covers an increasing number of areas, namely:      preventing and combating terrorism;       drug trafficking;       trafficking in human beings;       illegal immigrant smuggling;       trafficking in nuclear and radioactive substances;       motor vehicle crime;       counterfeiting and forgery of means of payment;       money laundering (except for predicate offences).      Europol’s sphere of competence includes offences involving the types of crime indicated above.      Setting up a single contact point in Member States: the national units      Each Member State establishes or designates a Europol national unit (ENU). This unit is the only liaison body between Europol and the competent national authorities. It sends at least one liaison officer to Europol whose task is to represent the unit’s interests within Europol. The heads of the national units meet on a regular basis.     The national unit’s duties include:      supplying Europol with the information and intelligence it needs to carry out its tasks, and in particular providing input for Europol’s database;       replying to and issuing requests for information to Europol;       disseminating the information provided by Europol to the competent authorities.      ENUs are Europol’s only point of entry into Member States. However, the amendments made to the Europol Convention by the November 2003 Protocol will enable direct contacts between a Member State’s competent authorities and Europol, on condition that the ENU is informed at the same time.      Administering and funding Europol      Europol is constituted and administered by a number of bodies, namely:       the management board        , comprising one representative of each Member State and of the Commission, which has observer status. The management board’s duties include helping to determine Europol’s priorities, unanimously determining the rights and obligations of liaison officers, laying down data-processing rules, preparing rules for work files and examining problems brought to its attention by the joint supervisory body. The board meets at least twice a year. Each year it unanimously adopts a report on Europol’s activities and a report on its future activities taking into account the Member States' operational requirements and the budgetary implications for Europol. These reports are submitted to the Council of the European Union (EU) for approval. The European Parliament is informed. The management board is chaired by the representative of the Member State holding the Presidency of the Council;        the director        , who, after obtaining the opinion of the management board, is unanimously appointed by the Council for a four-year period, which is renewable once. He is assisted by three deputy directors who are appointed by the Council for a once-renewable four-year period. Their tasks are determined by the director. The director’s responsibilities include performance of the tasks assigned to Europol, day-to-day administration and personnel management. The director is accountable to the management board and is Europol’s legal representative;        the financial controller        , who is unanimously appointed by the management board and accountable to it;        the financial committee        , consisting of one representative from each Member State.      Europol is financed from Member States' contributions. The accounts in respect of all income and expenditure entered in the budget, together with the balance sheet showing Europol's assets and liabilities, are subject to an annual audit. The draft budget and budget implementation are examined by the Council.      Compiling information: the IT database      To perform its tasks, Europol maintains an IT database. Under no circumstances may this database be linked to other automated processing systems, except for the systems of the national units. The national units are responsible for the security of data-processing equipment and for carrying out checks on the storage and deletion of data files. The system is made up of three components: the IT information system, work files and index system.     The       information system      may only be used to store, modify and utilise data that are necessary for the performance of Europol's tasks. The system does not contain data on related criminal offences. The data concern persons who, under the national law of a Member State, are suspected of having committed or having taken part in a criminal offence for which Europol is competent or who have been convicted of such an offence. The system also contains data concerning persons who are suspected of planning to commit criminal offences for which Europol is competent.     Personal data may only include the following details:      surname, given names and any alias or assumed name;       date and place of birth;       nationality;       sex;       other characteristics likely to assist in identification, such as any specific objective physical characteristics not subject to change.      The information system also includes the following details:      criminal offences, alleged crimes and where and when they were committed;       means that were or may have been used to commit the crimes;       the departments handling the case and their file references;       suspected membership of a criminal organisation;       convictions relating to criminal offences for which Europol is competent;       references to Europol or the inputting national unit.      Access to the information system is available to the national units, liaison officers, the director, the deputy directors and duly authorised Europol officials. The competent authorities designated by Member States have limited access to the information system. Further information may be obtained only via the national units. Only the unit that entered the data may modify, correct or delete them.     Europol may store, modify, and utilise data on the criminal offences for which it is competent in other files (       work files      ), including data on related criminal offences. Files opened for the purposes of analysis, with the aim of helping a criminal investigation, concern the following subjects:      persons who, under the national law of a Member State, are suspected of having committed or having taken part in a criminal offence for which Europol is competent or who have been convicted of such an offence;       persons who, under the national law of a Member State, are suspected of planning to commit criminal offences for which Europol is competent;       persons called on to testify in investigations in connection with offences or criminal proceedings;       victims of one of the offences under consideration or persons who could be victims of such offences;       contacts and associates;       persons who can provide information on the offences under consideration.      All IT databases containing personal data must indicate:      the file’s purpose and name;       the nature of the data to be stored;       the time limits for examining the data, duration of storage, etc.      Each analysis project entails setting up an analysis group comprising analysts and other Europol officials, as well as liaison officials and/or experts from Member States. Only analysts are authorised to input data into work files, but all participants may retrieve data from them. The collection, storage and processing of data takes place in strict compliance with the arrangements for protecting individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data.     Data may not be kept on file for more than three years. However, Europol reviews annually the need to continue keeping the data for the purposes of the file concerned. The Europol director may, where appropriate, decide to keep data for a further three-year period.     Europol sets up an       index system for data      stored in work files. The director, deputy directors, duly authorised officials of Europol and liaison officers are entitled to consult the index system.      Data protection: processing arrangements      Europol passes on any information concerning their Member State to the national units, as well as to their liaison officers if the national units so request. Member States ensure a standard of data protection under their national legislation that must at least correspond to the Council of Europe Convention of 28 January 1981. Each Member State must ensure that the data it transmits to Europol are legal, accurate and up to date, and check the storage time limits. Europol is responsible for data transmitted to it by third parties or resulting from analyses that it has carried out.     Individuals wishing to access data relating to them that have been stored at Europol may make a request to that effect free of charge to the national competent authority in the Member State of their choice. The competent authority refers the matter to Europol and informs the enquirer that Europol will reply to them directly. Requests must be fully dealt with by Europol within three months of receipt by the national authority. The right of individuals to access their data or to have such data checked must be exercised in accordance with the law of the Member State where the request was made. Europol may refuse to provide data where necessary to:      enable it to perform its tasks properly;       protect security and public order in Member States;       prevent crime;       protect the rights and freedoms of third parties.      Individuals have the right to ask Europol to correct or delete incorrect data concerning them. If data that are incorrect or contravene this Convention have been passed directly to Europol by a Member State, it must correct or delete them in collaboration with Europol. Europol informs requesters that the data concerning them have been corrected or deleted. If they are not satisfied with Europol's reply or have received no reply within three months, they may refer the matter to the joint supervisory body. This independent body monitors Europol’s activities to ensure that the rights of individuals are not violated by the storage, processing or utilisation of the data in its possession.     In addition to the joint supervisory body, each Member State designates a national supervisory body to ensure that personal data are input, retrieved and transmitted to Europol in accordance with national law. This body also ensures that the rights of the individuals concerned are not affected. Individuals have the right to ask the national body to check that the data concerning them were input, transmitted and consulted in accordance with the law. This right is exercised in accordance with the national law of the Member State to which the national supervisory body belongs.     Each Member State is liable for any damage caused to individuals as a result of legal or factual errors in data stored or processed at Europol. Only the Member State in which the event that gave rise to the damage occurred may be the subject of an action for compensation on the part of the injured party, who must apply to the courts with jurisdiction under the national law of that Member State.      Ensuring that action is effective: cooperation with European institutions, international institutions and third countries      On the basis of an act of its management board, Europol has concluded agreements with the following EU bodies through its International Relations – Cooperation agreements:      the European Central Bank (ECB);       Eurojust;       the European Commission;       the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction;       the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).      This Convention allows Europol to conclude strategic or operational cooperation agreements (only operational agreements provide for transmission of personal data) with third countries and international organisations.      Background      Member States have ratified this Convention in accordance with their respective constitutional arrangements. Following the Convention’s entry into force, various measures were taken to enable the European Police Office to be established. These concern the rights and obligations of liaison officers, rules for data files, rules of procedure of the joint supervisory body, staff regulations, rules on confidentiality, the financial regulation, the headquarters agreement, the protocol on privileges and immunities and the agreements on the privileges and immunities applicable to liaison officers. Europol started operations on 1 July 1999, when it replaced the       Europol Drugs Unit      (EDU), which had been set up on a provisional basis in 1995.     This Convention is open to accession by any state that becomes a member of the EU. Reservations are not permissible.     Two protocols to the Convention were adopted by the Council in November 2002 and November 2003. They have given Europol new powers to assist Member States, including: coordinating       joint investigation teams      , requesting investigations, allowing third countries (with which Europol has concluded operational agreements) to take part in analysis groups, etc.     As of 1 January 2010, the Convention is replaced by Council Decision       2009/371/JHA      establishing Europol. Consequently, possible amendments to Europol will be easier in future. The decision will establish       Europol      as a Union entity, subjecting it to the general rules and procedures of similar bodies and agencies, and thus simplifying its administration. At the same time, Europol will be funded from the general budget of the EU, placing it under the budgetary control of the European Parliament.

summary of   Directive 2002/65/EC — consumer protection in cases of distance-selling of financial services   summary    what does this directive do  It establishes common rules for the marketing of financial services by suppliers to consumers in the EU, thus enhancing consumer protection.   key points    Scope  : all financial services are covered by the directive including sales of credit cards, investment funds, insurance and personal pension plans to consumers by distance-selling channels such as telephone, fax and the internet.  The directive guarantees  protection to the consumer  , including:   An obligation on the supplier to provide consumers with  comprehensive information before a contract is concluded  ;   The right of the consumer  to withdraw  from the contract within 14 days;    A ban on abusive marketing practices  seeking to oblige consumers to buy a service they have not solicited (‘inertia’ selling);   rules to  restrict  other practices such as  unsolicited phone calls and emails  (cold calling and spamming);   appropriate  sanctions  by EU countries on suppliers who fail to comply with this directive;   proper  legal redress  , including out-of-court settlement procedures for consumers whose rights are infringed.   The  European Commission  has carried out a  review  of the application of the directive in EU countries, most recently in 2009. The  review  concluded that there was no evidence of consumers facing problems caused by the incorrect implementation of the directive by EU countries.   Directive 2011/83/EC  (Consumer Rights Directive) regulates the distance selling to consumers of all other  non-financial  goods and services, replacing Directive 97/7/EC.   since when does the directive apply  It entered into force on 9 October 2002. EU countries had to incorporate it in national law by 9 October 2004.   background    Distance Marketing of Financial Services   act   Directive  2002/65/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 September 2002 concerning the distance marketing of consumer financial services and amending Council Directives 90/619/EEC and directive 97/7/EC and 98/27/EC (OJ L 271, 9.10.2002, pp. 16-24)  Successive amendments to Directive 2002/65/EC have been incorporated in the basic text.

summary of   Directive (EU) 2015/2302 — package travel and linked travel arrangements   what is the aim of the directive  It aims to introduce a high, uniform level of consumer protection in relation to contracts for travel packages  *  and linked travel arrangements  *  , taking into account the increasing use of internet booking.   key points    Information   The following  information  should be provided by the organiser or retailer  before  a contract is signed:   itinerary with dates and number of nights included;   transport provided, including the times of departure and return, stops and connections;   accommodation details;   meal plan;   visits or other services to be included;   where group travel is involved, approximate size of the group;   the language of tourist services where appropriate;   suitability of the trip for persons with reduced mobility and, on the traveller’s request, the suitability of the trip or holiday taking into account the traveller’s needs;   contact details;   the total price inclusive of taxes and any additional costs;   arrangements for payment;   the minimum number of persons required for the package to take place and the time limit for possible cancellation for this reason;   passport and visa requirements, as well as information on health formalities;   the traveller may terminate the contract at any time before the start of the package in return for payment of an appropriate fee, or standardised termination fees requested by the organiser;   optional or compulsory insurance to cover a termination of the contract by the traveller or the cost of assistance in the event of accident, illness or death.   The  contract confirmation  will also include the following:   special requirements of the traveller which the organiser has accepted;   information that the organiser is responsible for the proper performance of all travel services included in the contract, and that the organiser is obliged to provide assistance if the traveller is in difficulty;   contact details of the insolvency protection organisation, and of the organiser’s local representative or of a contact point or any other service which enables the traveller to contact the organiser quickly and efficiently;   information that the traveller is required to communicate any lack of conformity;   for unaccompanied children, information enabling direct contact with the child or the person responsible for the child, where the child is staying;   information on complaint-handling procedures;   the traveller’s right to transfer the contract.   In good time before the start of the package, the organiser will provide the necessary receipts, vouchers and tickets and the necessary travel information.   Price increases   Price increases (limited to 8 % in most cases) are only allowed if the contract expressly reserves that possibility (in which case price reductions can also be claimed) and if they directly result from:   cost of fuel or other power sources;   third-party tax or fee increases;   exchange rates.   Any price increase should be notified at least 20 days before the start of the package.   Contract termination   Where the organiser makes  significant changes  to the contract, or increases the price by more than 8 %, the traveller can,  before the start of the package  , either accept the change, accept a substitute package (of equal or higher value), or has the right to terminate the contract with any payment refunded within 14 days.  The traveller can terminate the contract  at any time  before the start of the package (  paying an appropriate fee  ).  The traveller can also terminate (without paying a fee) in the event of  unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances  occurring at the place of destination or its immediate vicinity and significantly affecting the performance of the package, or which significantly affects the transport of passengers to the destination. There will be a  full refund  but  no additional compensation  .   Performance   The package organiser is responsible for the performance of the travel services in the contract, even if they are carried out by other providers. There are rules for  non-compliance  ,  termination  and  compensation  :   If any of the travel services are not performed in accordance with the contract, the organiser will remedy the lack of conformity, unless that is impossible or if the costs are disproportionate.   Where a significant proportion of the travel services cannot be provided as agreed, suitable alternative arrangements of equivalent or higher quality should be offered at no extra cost.   If the traveller's return cannot be ensured because of ‘unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances’, the organiser will pay the cost of accommodation for up to 3 nights.   The traveller may terminate the contract without paying a termination fee if a lack of conformity substantially affects the performance of the package and the organiser has failed to remedy it.   EU countries should ensure that messages, requests or complaints can be made  directly  to the retailer, and that the retailer forwards these to the organiser who must assist without undue delay.  There is  increased protection  for travellers in case of the  organiser’s insolvency  . A network of central contact points in EU countries will be set up to improve international cooperation.  This directive does not apply to arrangements:   covering less than 24 hours unless an overnight stay is included;   offered occasionally, on a not-for-profit basis and only to a limited group of travellers;   purchased as part of a  general  agreement for travel relating to a business or profession.   In general, EU countries must not introduce regulations providing a level of traveller protection which diverges from this directive. The new measures should be applied by 1 July 2018.  The directive repeals Directive  90/314/EEC  with effect from 1 July 2018.   from when does the directive apply  EU countries have to incorporate it into national law by 1 January 2018. It becomes applicable from 1 July 2018.  The directive was incorporated into the  European Economic Area Agreement  on 22 September 2017.   background   For more information, see    Package Travel  (  European Commission  )   Following the COVID-19 outbreak and introducing measures to cope with the impact of the crisis, the European Commission adopted:    Commission Recommendation (EU) 2020/648 of 13 May 2020 on vouchers offered to passengers and travellers as an alternative to reimbursement for cancelled package travel and transport services in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic     Communication from the Commission — Guidelines on protection of health, repatriation and travel arrangements for seafarers, passengers and other persons on board ships    key terms    Package:  in most cases, this means a combination of at least 2 different types of travel service (e.g. flight, rail trip and/or accommodation) as part of the same trip, generally purchased from a single point of sale. The services have been selected before the traveller agrees to pay, and it is sold at an inclusive price or advertised as a package.   Linked travel arrangement:  at least 2 different types of travel service purchased as part of the same trip, where there are separate contracts with the individual travel service providers. This applies either:     where separate services are selected and paid for on one visit to the point of sale, or   where the traveller is proposed another travel service within 24 hours of having booked a first one.

summary of   Directive 92/65/EEC: animal health requirements for trade in and imports into the EU of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to other specific rules   summary    what does this directive do   It lays down detailed animal health requirements for the trade in animals, semen, ova and embryos in the EU, including import rules.   Specific rules apply to particular groups of animals, with some of them covered by previous legislation or in amendments to this directive.   key points    Scope    Animals covered by the directive include:   zoo animals;   hoofed animals;   birds;   camels;   bees;   rabbits, hares, minks and foxes;   cats, dogs and ferrets.      Different sets of detailed rules  apply for  different categories  of animals. The directive outlines  requirements  in the following areas, depending on the species:   the need for animals to be identified;   regular and timely veterinary examination;   notifiable diseases to be reported;   disease control measures put in place by EU countries;   quarantine measures in certain circumstances;   health certification and the need for animals to be free from disease; and   animal welfare issues.     Directive  2004/68/EC  updates the rules applying to the import of hoofed animals, in particular to take into account the evolving nature of the risk of disease.  Circus animals are specifically covered in Commission Regulation (EC) No  1739/2005  .  The need for a veterinary examination is relaxed to 48 hours (previously 24 hours) prior to movement in updated rules for pets (for example, dogs, cats and ferrets) traded or imported non-commercially under Regulation (EU) No  576/2013  .  The directive also contains detailed rules for the trade in semen, ova and embryos of certain animals not already covered by legislation, such as horses, donkeys, sheep and goats.   from when does the directive apply  It entered into force on 29 July 1992. EU countries had to incorporate it into their national law by 1 January 1994.   background    Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/466 of 30 March 2020 on temporary measures to contain risks to human, animal and plant health and animal welfare during certain serious disruptions of Member States’ control systems due to coronavirus disease (COVID-19)   act   Council Directive  92/65/EEC  of 13 July 1992 laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A (I) to Directive 90/425/EEC (OJ L 268, 14.9.1992, pp. 54-72)  Successive amendments and changes to Directive 92/65/EEC have been incorporated in the original text.

   The fight against bioterrorism (communication)     The fight against bioterrorism (communication)     This Communication addresses the problems related to the health aspects of EU action against bioterrorism. The document presents the current situation, the results of progress made and the prospects for further work in this area.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 2 June 2003 to the Council and the European Parliament on cooperation in the European Union on preparedness and response to Biological and Chemical agent attacks (Health security) [       COM(2003) 320      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This Communication is a follow-up to the unprecedented terrorist attacks in the USA in September 2001. Governments and international bodies responded to this event by examining the means they had at their disposal to prevent and counter threats and mitigate the effects of such attacks. They also undertook to develop appropriate responses to a new type of threat, that of deliberate releases of biological and chemical agents.     This Communication reports on the health aspects of European Union (EU) action against bioterrorism and reviews the measures taken to strengthen health defences against deliberate releases of biological and chemical agents. It also highlights the challenges facing the health sector in terms of preparedness and response.      RECENT BIOTERRORIST INCIDENTS AND REPERCUSSIONS IN THE EU      Shortly after the attacks of 11 September, the US was hit by a spate of bioterrorist incidents involving anthrax spores. These terrorist acts had a significant impact in Europe. Civil protection and security forces were put on alert, and public health systems had to deal with numerous items of mail containing powders suspected of being contaminated with anthrax. Although no bioterrorist attack was known to have taken place in Europe, the pressure on European countries was high, as they quickly had to devote resources to preventing a new type of threat. In January 2003, the discovery of ricin -- a potentially fatal toxic substance -- in a building in London served as a sharp reminder to emergency health services to intensify their efforts in the fight against bioterrorism.     The international community and the EU responded to this new threat by adopting the following measures:      conclusions of the         Health Council        of 15 November 2001: the Belgian Presidency adopted conclusions which called on the Commission to develop an action programme of cooperation on preparedness and response to biological and chemical agent threats;        Ottawa initiative        : a meeting held in Ottawa on 7 November 2001 brought together the Health Ministers from the G7 group of countries, the Health Minister of Mexico and the Member of the Commission responsible for Health and Consumer Protection. The meeting agreed on concerted global action to strengthen the public health response to the threat of international biological, chemical and radio-nuclear terrorism;        Commission response        : the Commission launched a series of coordinated actions across the civil protection, health, enterprise (pharmaceuticals), research, nuclear and transport and energy fields. These were reported in the communication on "         Civil protection: state of preventive alert against possible emergencies        " published in November 2001.On 20 December 2002, the Council and the Commission also adopted a joint programme to improve cooperation between Member States in the evaluation of Chemical, Biological and Radio-Nuclear (CBRN) risks, alerts and intervention, the storage of means of intervention and in the field of research.       PUBLIC HEALTH PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE       Preparedness      Mitigating the effects of deliberate releases of biological and chemical agents requires early detection of the agents implicated and case recognition of those affected. Health authorities and agencies have a crucial role here and must:      establish effective surveillance;       familiarise clinicians with the syndromes to look out for;       disseminate case management guidelines;       put in place effective arrangements for prompt notifications to the authorities in charge of collecting and evaluating epidemiological information;       coordinate public health responses.      The necessary       laboratory      expertise and capacity must be available to cope with high-risk agents and complex technology as well as a surge in demand in case of multiple attacks.      Response      In the event of an attack, measures for physical protection and assistance must be able to be taken immediately and an initial assessment made of consequences and risks so that appropriate action can be initiated forthwith. The health authorities are responsible for taking preventive, remedial and treatment action (decontaminating exposed persons, taking swabs for analysis, administering prophylactic treatments, etc.). In addition, emergency plans provide a high degree of confidence in the capacity to mount an effective multi-sector response. The means of response and the deployment capability of health response staff must be strengthened in order to optimise their ability to cope in the event of an attack.      Coordination in the EU      The EU is a border-free area, so it is essential for appropriate arrangements to be put in place to ensure prompt notification and exchange of information in the event of threats and attacks. The importance of joint action in the EU led to the establishment in October 2001 of a Health Security Committee, comprised of representatives of the Health Ministers, to promote cooperation in countering bioterrorism. The Committee agreed a programme of cooperation on preparedness and response to biological and chemical agent attacks, code-named BICHAT, based on four objectives:      To set up an         alert and information exchange mechanism        This mechanism consists of a Health Security Committee and a rapid alert system. The Health Security Committee is responsible for exchanging information on health-related threats, on preparedness and response plans and crisis management strategies. The rapid alert system (code-named "RAS-BICHAT") has been in operation since June 2002 for notifications of incidents involving the deliberate release of biological and chemical agents to cause harm;       To         create a capability for the detection and identification        of biological and chemical agents that might be used in attacks.Detection of deliberate releases of biological agents relies first and foremost on Member States' surveillance systems for monitoring the occurrence of infectious diseases. It is essential that Member States continue to develop new diagnostics for rapid detection. Coordination of these surveillance systems at EU level is conducted in line with a Decision of September 1998 on the         surveillance and control of communicable diseases        .Biological agents likely to be used in bioterrorism have already been prioritised on the basis of various criteria. In addition, a Council Regulation (No 1334/2000) lays down various lists of biological and chemical agents for which provisions linked to export control arrangements apply.         Laboratory capacity        continues to be insufficient in many Member States. It is therefore imperative that Member States share resources and that those with advanced facilities assist those without;       To         create a database on medicines stock and health services        (see next section) and a stand-by facility for making medicines and health care specialists available in case of attack;       To         draw up rules and disseminate guidance        on responding to attacks from the health point of view and coordinating the EU response and links with third countries and international organisations. Consultations in the EU and internationally showed that the process of adjusting national emergency plans to the new threat of covert release of chemical and biological agents was not yet complete in the Member States. Moreover, it is a priority to intensify work on emergency planning and promote modelling in order to reinforce emergency plans for threats and attacks.      In February 2007, the Council extended the mandate of this Health Security Committee by three years.      AVAILABILITY AND STOCKPILING OF MEDICINES      The bioterrorist attacks in the USA highlighted the fundamental importance of the       availability of medicines      in the EU and the capability of industry to make good any shortcoming in production and supply. A joint Commission/pharmaceutical industry task force was established in December 2001 to address issues of availability, production capability, storage and distribution capacity for medicines which could be used in the event of a bioterrorist attack.      National stockpiles      In order to be able to cope with bioterrorist attacks, most Member States have stockpiled antibiotics at national level, or are in the process of doing so. Two of the larger Member States have offered to share stocks with other Member States. However, the majority of the other Member States did not wish to take up the offers made and the sharing scheme was not discussed further.     As the smallpox virus is regarded as the agent of choice for the development of biological weapons - because it is highly contagious and potentially fatal - an assessment of national stockpiles of smallpox vaccines was carried out. The assessment showed that most Member States have or are acquiring stockpiles of smallpox vaccines.      EU-level stockpiles      No medicines have yet been stockpiled at Community level. However, the Commission/pharmaceutical industry task force and the Member States have highlighted the need to establish a Community stockpile of smallpox vaccines, antibiotics and antivirals.     As regards       antibiotics      , a Community stockpile should comprise a sufficient, versatile range of antibiotics to cover as many of the potential pathogens as possible. In addition to economies of scale, establishing this kind of Community stockpile would enhance the feeling of security among European citizens. However, creating a stockpile of antibiotics may also lead to difficulties concerning the choice of antibiotics within the different therapeutic classes and the choice of final manufactured product.     As regards       smallpox vaccines      , it has been recognised that such a stockpile should exist in addition to national stockpiles rather than replace them. It should also provide equivalent access to all and should ensure equity for all citizens of the EU. Consultations on options for a Community stockpile showed that most Member States do not support the establishment of a Community-level stockpile of smallpox vaccines.      Planned action      Action has been taken under the health security programme to address the needs for cooperation on medicines. In addition, developments on the production and availability of smallpox vaccines will be reviewed at regular intervals.      RESEARCH      At the initiative of the Commission, an R&D Expert Group on countering the effects of biological and chemical terrorism was set up in 2001. This group prepared a report comprising an inventory of the research activities undertaken in the Member States on the basis of which various recommendations have been formulated.     The fight against bioterrorism is an issue which could be addressed under the       Sixth Framework Programme for Research      , under the priorities "life sciences, genomics and biotechnology for health" and "food quality and safety". Specific research needs could also be addressed in the "scientific support to policy" section of the programme where a specific action line has been introduced on "issues related to civil protection and crisis management".      BUILDING A MULTI-SECTOR RESPONSE      Preventing terrorist acts and responding to their consequences requires the mobilisation of actors and resources in many sectors other than health. Sectors which should be given particular attention include the following:      food safety: the Community has a broad body of legislation which covers primary production of agricultural products and industrial production of processed food. There is therefore no need to establish new systems, but rather to adjust the current mechanisms in order to improve their functioning, taking into account the threat of bioterrorism;       animal safety: as is the case for food safety, the EU has a very comprehensive body of legislation in this area. It is therefore important to put these existing mechanisms to good use in order to take greater account of the threat of biological and chemical terrorism;       plant safety: the use of plant protection products on crops is part of the food chain management. Structures specifically intended to prevent the abuse of plant protection products are already in place in the Community in order to prevent or discover unintended contamination;       water safety: the joint Council/Commission programme called on Member States and the Community to examine whether Community measures on the quality of drinking water and surface waters were sufficient to meet requirements in relation to safety and early detection of infective agents and toxicants.       INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION      At the Ottawa meeting of November 2001, a Global Health Security Action Group was formed to implement the concerted action plan agreed at that meeting. The plan provides for the sharing of information and experience on preparedness and response plans, collaboration of laboratories, training for health staff and the development of risk management and communication methods.     The Commission is cooperating bilaterally with the       World Health Organisation      (WHO) on a number of subjects related to countering the effects of the deliberate release of biological and chemical agents. Meetings between the Council, the Commission and NATO have led to an exchange of documents on activities related to chemical, biological and radio-nuclear activities. These exchanges could serve as a reference point for further cooperation on the issue.     RELATED ACTS      Commission Green Paper of 11 July 2007 on bio-preparedness [         COM(2007) 399        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      Terrorism is considered one of the main challenges currently facing the European Union. The attacks in Madrid, London and New York made it clear that terrorism remains a threat to all countries. Terrorists may resort to non-conventional means such as biological materials, which have the capacity to infect thousands of people, destroy agriculture, infect animals and poison food. The risk of "bioterrorist" attacks is low, but the consequences of such acts can be devastating.     Naturally occurring diseases, laboratory accidents or other inadvertent releases of disease agents are another threat which could also harm European societies.     This Green Paper thus aims to launch a process of consultation at European level on how to reduce biological risks and enhance preparedness and response to biological threats.     The term "preparedness" covers all aspects of the issue, such as prevention, protection, first response capacity, prosecution of criminals, surveillance, research capacity, response and recovery.     This consultation process is mainly aimed at the national authorities responsible for risk prevention and response, public health and customs, law enforcement authorities, bio-industry and epidemiological and health professionals. It may lead to concrete actions in the field of bio-preparedness in 2008.     Replies from stakeholders had to be sent to the Commission by 1 October 2007.

act   Regulation (EC) No  782/2003  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 April 2003 on the prohibition of organotin compounds on ships   summary    what does the regulation do  This regulation incorporates the rules of the  International Maritime Organisation’s  (IMO) Anti-Fouling Systems (AFS) Convention* into European Union (EU) law. It aims to prohibit organotin compounds on all ships entering EU ports in order to reduce or eliminate the adverse effects of these products.   key points    What are organotin compounds?   Organotin compounds are chemicals from anti-fouling paints used on boat hulls and nets. These surface coatings act as biocides, designed to prevent the attachment of algae, molluscs and other organisms which slow down vessel speeds.   What are their effects?   They are highly toxic for sea life (larvae, mussels, oysters and fish) and, for this reason, have been banned in many EU countries.  The regulation  applies to  :   ships flying the flag of an EU country;   ships not flying the flag of an EU country but operating under the authority of an EU country;   ships entering a port in an EU country but not covered by the two previous points.   It does not apply to any warship, naval auxiliary or other ships owned by a State, whether part of the EU or not, and used on government service.  It imposes the following  restrictions  :   from  1 July 2003  , organotin compounds which act as biocides in  AFS  may no longer be applied on  ships flying the flag of an EU country  ;   from  1 January 2008, ships entering port in an EU country  must either bear no coating of organotin compounds acting as biocides or must bear a second layer to prevent organotin compounds escaping from the non-compliant anti-fouling under layer.    Survey and certification   The regulation introduces a survey and certification system for  ships flying the flag of an EU country  . It requires:   ships of 400 gross tonnage and above to be surveyed and certified, irrespective of the voyage;   ships of 24 metres or more in length, but less than 400 gross tonnage, to simply carry a declaration of compliance with the regulation or with the AFS Convention.   no survey or certification is envisaged for ships of less than 24 metres in length, i.e. mainly pleasure and fishing boats.    Commission Regulation (EC) No 536/2008  , which amends the original regulation, sets out how  ships flying the flag of a non EU country  must comply with the restrictions. It requires:   ships flying the flag of a  State which is party to the AFS Convention  to show their compliance through an international AFS certificate;   ships flying the flag of a State  which is not a party to the AFS Convention  to hold a statement of compliance issued by the flag State in accordance with the AFS Convention and the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) of the IMO.   keywords    *  International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-Fouling Systems   : an agreement prohibiting the use of harmful organotins in anti-fouling paints used on ships and which creates a mechanism to prevent the potential future use of other harmful substances in AFS.

act   Communication from the Commission on the promotion of inland waterway transport ‘NAIADES’ - an integrated European action programme for inland waterway transport (  COM(2006) 6  final of 17 January 2006).   summary   Inland waterways can make a major contribution to a sustainable European Union transport system, reducing congestion and pollution on Europe’s roads. However, national and EU-level initiatives are needed to develop its full potential.   what does the communication do  It presents an integrated strategy to make the use of inland navigation more attractive and feasible. The action programme ‘Navigation and inland waterway action and development in Europe’ (NAIADES) focuses on 5 strategic areas.   key points    Markets: opportunities should be developed, particularly in niche areas such as the transport of waste, dangerous goods, extremely large loads and river-sea-shipping.   Fleet: continuous investment in modernisation and innovation are necessary to improve vessel design, reduce fuel consumption and improve safety technology.   Jobs and skills: better working and social conditions, allied to appropriate education and training facilities, should encourage people to work in the sector.   Image: inland navigation’s outdated image should be improved and modernised so it accurately reflects the technological performance that has been achieved.   Infrastructure: a European development plan could remove the many bottlenecks which exist such as low bridges and narrow locks. This should be accompanied by modernisation of the overall organisational structure to remove administrative hurdles.   In 2013, the Commission updated the NAIADES programme (  NAIADES II  ), setting out specific objectives up to 2020. Its aim is to create the conditions for inland navigation to become a quality form of transport.  In 2014, the EU adopted  legislation  to enable governments to take measures to improve the sector’s competitiveness through early retirement schemes, wider use of innovation and training and safety programmes.   background   Over 37,000 kilometres of waterways and hundreds of inland ports connect many of Europe’s most important industrial areas. This network can play an important sustainable role as the volume of freight transport continues to grow.  For more information, see the European Commission  Inland waterways  website.
   Trans-European networks: towards an integrated approach     Trans-European networks: towards an integrated approach     The transport, energy and telecommunications infrastructures have been designed on national lines and need to be harmonised, connected and integrated into the wider European context via the Trans-European Networks (TENs). At the same time, environmental concerns require the design and layout of the infrastructures to be reworked. Consequently, the European Commission assessed the TENs in 2006 and is now delivering the findings of the steering group responsible for examining a possible joint approach to TENs.     ACT     Commission Communication of 21 March 2007 to the Council and the European Parliament entitled: "Trans-European Networks: Towards an integrated approach" [       COM(2007) 135      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The trans-European networks (TENs) constitute an ambitious and essential objective for the competitiveness of the European Union and therefore for growth and jobs. Several major industrial programmes such as       GALILEO      ,       ERTMS      and       SESAR      are following the logic of Europeanisation of transport infrastructures, often designed only according to national requirements.     Sustainable use of resources is a key element in TEN policy, since the most environmentally-friendly procedures enjoy a privileged status amongst the priority projects.      Assessment of TENs in 2006      The completion of 30 priority       transport      projects is behind schedule as the new, very costly infrastructures required have not been granted sufficient resources. The network is still incomplete, with investments of EUR 160 billion needed to finance the priority projects alone for the financial programming period 2007-2013. The European Regional Development Fund (       ERDF      ) and the       Cohesion Fund      remain the principal sources of Community intervention, and the European Investment Bank (       EIB      ) will continue to fund the infrastructures via its loans and a specific Guarantee Instrument.     The Community has recently adopted guidelines aimed at updating the trans-European energy networks (Decision No       1364/2006/EC)      . Some 42 projects, including 10 relating to gas networks, have been declared of European interest. The EU must invest at least EUR 30 billion in infrastructures between now and 2013. Between 2000 and 2006, approximately EUR 140 million was invested in the trans-European energy networks under the TEN budget. A figure of EUR 155 million has been earmarked for the financial period 2007-2013. The Commission has stressed here again, however, that the allocated amounts are limited in light of the issues at stake and actual requirements.     Investments in       telecommunications      are currently focused on modernising existing networks. The Commission has highlighted the disparities between urban and rural areas (already identified in its communication entitled       Bridging the Broadband Gap      ) and invites the Member States to take concrete measures and define goals for reducing these differences by 2010. Public aid is encouraged in the event of market failure, in strict compliance with telecommunications and State aid regulations. A map of the infrastructures is needed to help the competent authorities assess their requirements and take advantage of ongoing civil engineering work.      Towards an integrated approach: the findings of the steering group      The steering group set up on 20 July 2005 at the request of the Commission has examined the possible synergies between the trans-European networks along with methods of funding and potential distribution. It has established that combinations of rail and road networks have shown themselves to be of significant value (more efficient use of space, reduced costs and environmental impact) and there are definite advantages in linking the two types of TEN. Synergies between the transport and telecommunications networks seem the most promising and ways of interconnecting the electricity networks are also worth exploring.     The steering group also underlined the potential environmental benefits of integrating the TEN. In fact, the 30 priority projects involving the trans-European transport network largely favour methods of transport which are more fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly, such as rail or water. Interconnections between the national energy networks and connections with renewable energy sources will also optimise the use of available capacities in each Member State, thus reducing the environmental impact.     The steering group recommends:      continuing research into synergies between the TENs with the aim of producing and circulating a manual of good practices, and developing synergies between the objectives of cohesion policy and the priorities adopted in the TEN context;       evaluating the need for alternative solutions for availability payments over several financial periods and making appropriate legislative proposals if necessary;       monitoring the development of public-private partnerships and promoting this type of funding;       completing TEN priority projects on schedule while ensuring the application of environmental law.       New technologies      A midterm review of the       2001 White Paper on transport policy      acknowledges the role of new information and communication technologies in ensuring that people and goods can travel safely and sustainably. Numerous schemes, including the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITSs), the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) and the European satellite navigation project GALILEO, represent effective tools for increasing safety and reducing congestion and environmental impact.     The group thus recommends that investments in the ITSs be integrated, from the early planning stages, into all new trans-European transport network (TEN-T) projects.      Legal clarification on non-cumulation of Community funds       The steering group concluded that there must be no possibility of cumulation of subsidies from several Community funds and has confirmed the need to maintain a consistent approach across the various legal instruments. Thus, when granting aid under the TEN arrangements, the Commission will check whether or not the projects have already received aid from the Structural or Cohesion Funds      .     According to the steering group, delays in the priority transport projects are largely due to difficulties in reconciling the rules for granting Community subsidies from the TEN budget with the actual financial needs of the projects. The new TEN regulation should make it easier to part-finance the major cross-border projects, which are technically and financially complex.     The steering group also stressed the advantages of funding by public-private partnerships (       PPP      ), and the benefits of a European Guarantee Instrument (provided by the EIB) to encourage the PPPs to fund the TEN-Ts. Such a system could help to lessen the risks linked to insufficient revenue during the initial years of operation of a project, and generate a considerable lever effect.     Based on the availability risk, PPPs will also form an integral part of the forms of subsidies eligible for Community financial support under the new regulation on transport and energy TENs.

   Passengers and goods: Driver attestation     Passengers and goods: Driver attestation     This regulation aims to establish a uniform Community attestation permitting the effective checking of the regularity of the employment status of drivers from third countries employed by hauliers in the Member States engaged in the international carriage of goods.     ACT     Regulation (EC) No       484/2002      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 1 March 2002 amending Council Regulations (EEC) No       881/92      and (EEC) No 3118/93 for the purposes of establishing a driver attestation [Official Journal L 76, 19.03.2002].     SUMMARY      Background      The impossibility of checking whether drivers are legally employed or used outside the territory of the Member State where a haulier is established has given rise to a market in which drivers from third countries are sometimes irregularly used only to carry out the international carriage of goods outside the Member State in which the haulier employing them is established. This Regulation has been designed to combat such practices.     These irregularly employed drivers often work in precarious conditions and are poorly paid, which is a threat to road safety. This situation seriously distorts competition between hauliers engaged in such practices and those that use only legally employed drivers.      New rules      International carriage by road was already subject to a Community authorisation under Regulation (EEC) No       881/92      . Under Regulation (EC) No       484/2002      , drivers who are nationals of third countries must from now on be in possession of a driver attestation.     The attestation must certify that a driver is employed in the haulier's Member State of establishment in accordance with the laws and regulations applicable in that Member State.     The scope of the Regulation is restricted to drivers from non-member countries. The scope may be extended to drivers who are nationals of Member States, after evaluation by the Commission.     Driver attestations will be issued by a Member State to the haulier requesting them for each driver who is the national of a third country and whom he legally employs.     The attestation must comply with the model in the Annex to the Regulation. Driver attestations are issued for a period to be determined by the issuing Member State, subject however to a maximum validity of five years. The attestation must be produced whenever required by authorised inspecting officers.     The competent authorities of a Member State may withdraw a driver attestation where the holder:      has failed to observe the conditions in accordance with which the attestation was issued;       has supplied incorrect information in relation to the data required for the issue or renewal of a driver attestation.      A certified true copy of the driver attestation must be kept at the haulier's premises.     The original driver attestation must be kept on board the vehicle and presented for inspection whenever required by authorised inspecting officers.

summary of   Decision (CFSP) 2015/1835 — statute, seat and operational rules of the European Defence Agency   summary    what does this decision do  It lays down rules on the functioning of the  European Defence Agency  (EDA), thus providing a legal and institutional framework to enable EU countries to cooperate in developing military capabilities in the context of the EU’s  common foreign and security policy  , and in particular, the  common security and defence policy  (CSDP).   key points   The tasks of the EDA are to:   contribute to identifying EU countries’ military capability objectives and evaluate their capability commitments,   promote the harmonisation of operational needs (e.g. by promoting and coordinating harmonisation of military requirements or by promoting cost-effective and efficient procurement by identifying and disseminating best practice),   introduce projects to fulfil military capability objectives and ensure coordination programmes are implemented by EU countries,   support defence technology research and coordinate/plan joint research activities,   contribute to strengthening the EU defence sector’s industrial base to improve the effectiveness of military expenditure,   pursue coherence with other EU policies which have defence implications,   foster deeper defence cooperation between EU countries,   provide support for CSDP operations.    Governance of the EDA:    The EDA is headquartered in Brussels and is under the political supervision and the authority of the  Council of the EU  , to which it reports and from which it receives guidelines.   The  High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy  is the  Head of Agency  , who leads the Steering Board and provides the link between the EDA and the Council.   The  Chief Executive  of the EDA, assisted by the Deputy Chief Executive, is responsible for the oversight and coordination of the EDA's work. They are appointed by the Steering Board.   The decision-making body of the EDA is the  Steering Board  , which is comprised of Defence Ministers from each EU country (except for Denmark) and a  European Commission  representative. It meets at least twice a year to decide on matters including the annual budget, work programme and new initiatives.   Funding:   The operating costs of the EDA are funded by EU countries (except for Denmark) in proportion to their  gross national income  (GNI).   Individual projects are funded separately by the participating EU countries.   from when does the decision apply  It applies from 13 October 2015.   background   The EDA was established in 2004. Since then, a number of amendments have been made regarding its statute, seat and operational rules. These changes have been consolidated in this decision.

summary of   Regulation (EU) 2015/1839 — specific measures for Greece under the EU’s Structural and Investment Funds   summary    what does this regulation do  It establishes measures that increase the initial pre-financing* and the co-financing rates* for certain programmes in Greece supported by the  European Structural and Investment Funds  — i.e. the  European Regional Development Fund  (ERDF), the  European Social Fund  (ESF), the  Cohesion Fund  (CF) and the  European Maritime and Fisheries Fund  (EMFF) for the 2014-2020 period.   key points    In both 2015 and 2016, an additional (to the previous 1 %) pre-financing rate of  3.5 %  of the total amount of support from the funds for 2014-2020 period will be paid to programmes under the  investment for growth and jobs goal  , financed by the ERDF, the ESF and the CF, as well as to programmes financed by the EMFF.   Co-financing rates for Greek 2007-2013 programmes for the convergence objective (for regions where gross domestic product per head is under 75 % of the EU average) and the regional competitiveness and employment objective in Greece are increased to 100 %.   The ceiling for payments to these programmes before the end of the programming period is also raised to 100 %.   Greece will establish a reporting mechanism to ensure that financial resources are effectively spent.   background   The financial crisis had led to persistently negative growth rates in Greece as well as to serious liquidity problems and a lack of public funds available for much-needed investments to boost growth and job creation. The regulation introduces specific measures to ensure that European funding is effectively used for investments on the ground and reaches beneficiaries as rapidly as possible   key terms    * Pre-financing  is a payment intended to provide the programme authorities with liquidity to start programme implementation.   * Co-financing  is the requirement for EU funding to be matched with funding from national and/or regional levels in order to increase the leverage effect and ownership of investments.   act   Regulation (EU)  2015/1839  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 October 2015 amending Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 as regards specific measures for Greece (OJ L 270, 15.10.2015, pp. 1-3)
   Speed limitation on-board devices of certain categories of motor vehicles (until 2014)     Speed limitation on-board devices of certain categories of motor vehicles (until 2014)     In the interests of road safety, the European Union is limiting the maximum road speed of heavy goods and passenger-carrying vehicles circulating within the Community.     ACT     Council Directive       92/24/EEC      of 31 March 1992 relating to speed limitation devices or similar speed limitation on-board systems of certain categories of motor vehicles [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     Speed limitation devices for heavy motor vehicles help improve road safety by reducing the wear and tear on engines and tyres and the severity of injuries resulting from accidents. They also have positive effects on atmospheric pollution and fuel consumption. The European Union has therefore considered it necessary for vehicles circulating within the Community to be equipped with such devices.      Scope      This directive applies to EEC type-approved speed limitation devices and similar systems which fulfil the same speed limitation function.     It initially applied only to heavy motor vehicles. Amended by Directive       2004/11/EC      , it has been extended to cover all buses and all goods transport vehicles weighing over 3.5 tonnes. It now applies to all M2, M3, N2 and N3 category motor vehicles (as defined in Annex II of Directive       70/156/EEC)      intended for on-road use, having at least four wheels and a maximum design speed exceeding 25km/h.      Requirements      The directive requires that the speed limitation device be so designed, constructed and assembled as to resist corrosion and ageing phenomena, and that it be resistant to tampering so that the limitation threshold can neither be increased nor overridden.      EEC type-approval      The application for EEC type-approval for the speed limitation of a vehicle type must be submitted by the vehicle manufacturer, but for a speed limitation device as a technical unit it must be submitted by the manufacturer of that device.     If the requirements of the Directive have been met, the Member States may not, on grounds relating to the speed limitation devices, refuse EEC or national type-approval for a vehicle or a speed limitation device, nor may they refuse the registration, sale, or entry into service of a vehicle or a speed limitation device.     In contrast, the Member States are obliged to refuse, on grounds relating to the speed limitation devices, EC or national type-approval for vehicles or speed limitation devices which do not satisfy the requirements of the Directive. In addition, as of 1 January 2005, they must also ban the sale, registration and entry into service of vehicles or speed limitation devices that do not comply with the requirements of the Directive.      Background      Directive       92/24/EEC      is one of the separate Directives of the Community type-approval procedure established by Directive       70/156/EEC      . By harmonising the technical provisions relating to speed limitation devices and speed limitation systems, it therefore plays a part in ensuring the smooth operation of the internal market.

Directive       1992/6/EEC      stipulates that motor vehicles may only circulate within the European Community if they are equipped with a speed limitation device for which a maximum speed is set. The Directive was initially aimed at heavy vehicles. Subsequent to its amendment by Directive       2002/85/EC      , it has been extended to cover light commercial vehicles.

Council  conclusions  on the post 2015 Hyogo Framework for Action - managing risks to achieve resilience (June 2014) (see pp. 29-33).   summary   Average annual losses from natural disasters have risen from EUR 9 billion in the 1980s to more than EUR 13 billion in the 2000s. To address these alarming trends, prevention and risk management policies are essential.  The main focus of the European Union (EU)  Civil Protection legislation  is on preparedness and prevention policy and action. Domestically, the mechanism sets out new commitments to develop further risk assessments, the assessment of risk management capabilities, the use of peer reviews for EU countries to learn from each other in managing disaster risks and the knowledge and evidence base for  disaster management  . Innovative solutions for financing disaster prevention are also high on the agenda, including the use of insurance as a tool for disaster management and as an incentive to promote risk awareness, prevention and mitigation.  Disaster risk prevention and management considerations have been included in a number of key EU policies, including cohesion policy, health, environmental impact assessment, climate change adaptation, ecosystems, agriculture, food and nutrition security, water, flood risk management, major industrial accident prevention, risk financing, nuclear safety, transport, energy, research and innovation.   what does this communication say  The Commission has adopted a communication on the post-2015 Hyogo Framework for Action - managing risks to achieve resilience. Supported by Council  conclusions  , it supports a common EU position for the global negotiations at United Nations (UN) level on a new post-2015 Framework for Action for Disaster Risk Reduction.  The Commission has built the recommendations based on the past achievements in disaster risk management of a range of EU policies, including civil protection, environmental protection, internal security, climate change adaptation, health, research and innovation and external action. These achievements are an important EU contribution towards building a coherent policy on disaster risk management at European and international levels.   Key proposals of the Commission     1.    More transparency and better governance of the new post-2015 Hyogo Framework for Action: the Commission suggests governance standards, periodic peer reviews by countries and the collection and sharing of globally comparable data on disaster losses and hazards.      2.    Focus on results: the Commission proposes the introduction of targets and measurable actions to reduce disaster risks.      3.    Disaster risk-reduction measures should contribute to sustainable and smart growth: all major infrastructure and projects should be risk-sensitive and climate-and-disaster-resilient (i.e. should be built in such a way that they are as resistant as possible to withstand disasters). Innovative technologies and instruments to support disaster management should be further encouraged (the installation of early-warning systems, resilient infrastructure and buildings,  green infrastructure  , risk communication, etc.) in order to lead to increased business opportunities and contribute to green growth.      4.    Special attention to the most vulnerable: the Commission also expects the new Hyogo Framework for Action to be more gender-sensitive and to target vulnerable groups, such as children, elderly people, persons with disabilities, the homeless and the poor. Particular attention should be paid to building resilience in all urban and vulnerable rural settings, as well as in coastal areas.      5.    Alongside natural hazards, a comprehensive international framework should also address conflict and other forms of violence and state fragility (countries with weak state capacities and institutions), as well as technological risks (nuclear, for example), food and nutrition insecurity and epidemics.     background   The EU supports the  Hyogo Framework for Action  (HFA), which promotes disaster risk reduction and awareness worldwide. It also encourages the inclusion of disaster risk reduction in the post-2015 framework for poverty eradication and sustainable development. In this context, the European Commission issued in 2014 a communication on the post-2015 HFA - managing risks to achieve resilience. This contributed to shaping a common EU position during international negotiations on the renewed international (UN) framework for disaster risk reduction.  The HFA's ‘building the resilience of nations and communities to disasters’ is a 10-year plan adopted by 168 UN member countries that voluntarily committed to work on five priorities for action so as to make the world safer from natural hazards and to build disaster resilience. Covering the period 2005-15, the HFA is replaced by the post-2015 framework for disaster risk reduction, endorsed at the 3rd world conference for disaster risk reduction in Sendai (Japan) on 14-18 March 2015.
   Making financial corrections     Making financial corrections     1) OBJECTIVE     To lay down the procedure for making financial corrections to assistance granted under the Structural Funds.     2) ACT     Commission Regulation (EC) No       448/2001      of 2 March 2001 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No       1260/1999      as regards the procedure for making financial corrections to assistance granted under the Structural Funds [Official Journal L 64 of 06.03.2001].     3) SUMMARY     The general       Regulation on the Structural Funds      for the programming period 2000-06 requires the Member States to make the financial corrections required as a result of an individual or systemic irregularity by cancelling all or part of the Community contribution.     Applying this provision in uniform fashion throughout the Community requires rules to determine the financial corrections and the information to be sent to the Commission. These rules are without prejudice to those on the recovery of State aids.     There are two types of financial corrections:      those made by the Member States,       those made by the Commission.       Financial corrections made by the Member States      When cancelling all or part of the Community part-financing, the Member States must take account of the nature and seriousness of the irregularities and the financial loss to the Structural Funds.     In an annex to the last quarterly report for each year, the Member States are to notify the Commission of the list of procedures for the cancellation of assistance begun during the previous year and of any measures to adjust the systems of management and inspection.     The cancelled contribution from the Structural Funds may not be reallocated to the operation to which the correction related. However, the Member States must notify the Commission of their decisions or proposals to reallocate the amounts cancelled, indicating, where appropriate, any amendment to the financing plan for the assistance.      Financial corrections made by the Commission      The Commission may find that a Member State has not complied with its obligations, that all or part of the assistance does not justify a contribution from the Funds or that national systems of management and inspection result in irregularities which are systemic in nature. It may then decide to make financial corrections equal to the expenditure wrongly charged to the Funds.     If it is impossible to quantify the irregular expenditure, the Commission will base its financial corrections on an extrapolation (the use of a representative sample of transactions with similar characteristics) or adopt a flat-rate basis (assessment of the gravity of the infringement and the extent of the financial consequences).     The Member State has two months in which to respond to the Commission's requests; there are no exceptions to this time limit. The Member State may show that the actual size of the irregularity is less than that detected by the Commission. To do that, it has a further two months. From the date of the hearing at which the Member State explains its reasons, the Commission has three months to take a decision.     In accordance with the       Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget      of the European Communities, financial corrections must be repaid to the Commission within the time period specified in the recovery order. A delay in repayment results in the levying of interest.     Regulation (EEC) No       1685/90      has been repealed. It continues to apply to assistance granted for the period 1994-99.

summary of   Decision 2000/278/EC approving the World Intellectual Property Organisation Copyright Treaty and the World Intellectual Property Organisation Performances and Phonograms Treaty on behalf of the EU    World Intellectual Property Organisation Copyright Treaty — Joint declarations    World Intellectual Property Organisation Performances and Phonograms Treaty — Joint declarations   what is the aim of the decision and of the treaties  The decision approves 2 treaties concluded in December 1996 on behalf of the European Community (now the EU). The treaties in question are the  World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)   Copyright Treaty (WCT)  and the  WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT)  .  The aim of the WCT and the WPPT, also known as the WIPO ‘internet’ treaties, is to adapt the international protection of copyright and related rights to the internet age by supplementing the content of the  Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works  .   key points    WCT   Under this treaty, authors are provided with the exclusive rights of distribution and rental and with a broader right of communication to the public of their works in the digital environment. Computer programs are protected as literary works and the arrangement or selection of data or other material in databases is also protected. Specific protection is also provided for technological measures and electronic rights management information used to identify and manage works.   WPPT   This treaty concerns related rights and improves the protection of artists/performers and producers of phonograms (i.e. recordings), particularly in the digital environment. They enjoy exclusive rights for the reproduction, distribution, rental and making available to the public of their performances and phonograms. They also receive a right to equitable remuneration for broadcasting or for any communication to the public of their phonograms published for commercial purposes.   Accession of the EU   In its decision of 16 March 2000, the  Council  approved the 2 treaties on behalf of the EU and authorised the  European Commission  to represent the EU at the meetings of the  Assemblies  referred to in the treaties. According to this decision, the position of the EU will be prepared by the relevant Council working party. For the first time, the EU became party to WIPO treaties in the field of copyright and neighbouring rights.   from when do the decision and the treaties apply  These treaties entered into force 3 months after 30 instruments of ratification or accession by states were submitted to the WIPO.  The EU’s instruments of ratification were deposited by the EU and the EU countries on 14 December 2009 after all the EU countries had incorporated into their national law Directive 2001/29/EC on  copyright and related rights in the information society  , which adapted EU legislation to the content of the treaties.   background   The conventions of  Paris  (protection of industrial property, 1883) and Berne (protection of literary and artistic works, 1886) form the basis of the WIPO treaties. Subsequent treaties extended the protection offered to other subject matters (e.g. performance, phonograms) by taking account of technical developments and new fields of interest (e.g. the information society).  The last WIPO treaty ratified by the EU (in 2018) is the  Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons who are Blind, Visually Impaired, or otherwise Print Disabled  . Its aim is to improve the availability and cross-border exchange of certain works and other protected subject matter in accessible formats for persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print disabled. Parties to the treaty have the freedom to implement its provisions, taking into account their own legal systems and practices, complying with the obligations set out in the Berne Convention.

   In vitro diagnostic medical devices     In vitro diagnostic medical devices     SUMMARY OF:      Directive 98/79/EC on in vitro diagnostic medical devices      SUMMARY     The directive aims to guarantee the smooth operation of the single market by harmonising different national legislation on the reliability of in vitro diagnostic devices*. It provides a high level of protection for the health and safety of patients, users and others and ensures the devices achieve the results for which they are intended.     WHAT DOES THE DIRECTIVE DO?     It sets out the essential safety, health, design and manufacturing requirements that in vitro diagnostic medical devices and their accessories must meet. This ensures universally high safety standards, giving the public confidence in the system. It enables the products to be used in any European Union country.     KEY POINTS      National authorities must ensure that all devices available in the EU are safe when they are supplied, properly installed, maintained and used as they should be.       The devices must meet essential safety requirements in their design and other characteristics.       Devices which meet these standards are given a         CE marking        and can be used throughout the EU.       2 committees — one on standards and technical regulations, the other on medical devices* — provide advice to the Commission on implementation of the legislation.       National authorities must take off the market any devices which are later found to harm people’s health.       They must immediately explain to the Commission the reasons for their decision. Other EU governments are kept informed.       The         New Approach Notified and Designated Organisations (NANDO) Information System        contains details of the national bodies that check the devices meet EU standards.      KEY TERMS      * Medical devices      : appliances, including the necessary software, used to diagnose, prevent, monitor, treat or alleviate disease or injury; to diagnose, monitor, treat, alleviate or compensate an injury or handicap, to investigate, replace or modify the human body or a physiological process; or as a contraceptive.      * In vitro diagnostic medical device      : medical devices, such as reagents, calibrators, control material test tubes, to perform a diagnostic test, like checking blood for signs of infections or urine for the presence of glucose, using material from the human body.

They were accompanied by Council conclusions setting out the EU’s political position and explaining the reasons for the imposition of sanctions.  A further Council Decision  adopted  in January 2018 placed 7 individuals holding official positions under restrictive measures.   key points   The  EU Treaties  provide the necessary legal bases conferring on the EU the power to  impose sanctions  (restrictive measures) on governments of non-EU countries, non-state entities and individuals to bring about a change in their policy or activity.   Restrictive measures   The decision and the regulation notably provide for the following measures:   a  ban on the  export of arms and equipment   which might be used for internal repression (a list of included items is found in Annex I of the regulation);   a  ban on the export of surveillance equipment  (a list of included items is found in Annex II of the regulation);   the  freezing of funds   *  (financial assets and benefits of all kinds) and economic resources  *  of:   certain persons, entities and bodies responsible for either serious  human rights  violations, or the repression of civil society and democratic opposition, or   those whose actions, policies or activities otherwise undermine democracy or the rule of law in Venezuela (lists of the individuals, entities and bodies covered may be found in Annexes IV and V of the regulation);      restrictions on admission of individual persons  to the territory of EU countries (‘  travel ban  ’).   The regulation is directly applicable in and binding on the EU countries' competent authorities and thereby ensures uniform application of the measures within the EU, in particular as regards businesses. The decision (imposing the travel ban and arms embargo) is binding on the EU countries but requires national implementation measures.   from when do the regulation and the decision apply  The regulation and the decision have applied since 14 November 2017.   background   For more information, see:    Delegation of the European Union to Venezuela  (  European External Action Service  ).   key terms    Freezing of funds:  preventing any move, transfer, alteration or use of, access to, or dealing with funds in any way that would result in:   any change in their volume, amount, location, ownership, possession, character or destination; or   any other change that would enable the funds to be used, including portfolio management.

summary of   Decision 94/140/EC setting up an advisory committee for the coordination of fraud prevention in the EU   what is the aim of the decision  It establishes the  Advisory Committee for the Coordination of Fraud Prevention  (Cocolaf), which aims to build cooperation between EU countries and the  European Commission  to prevent and ensure the prosecution of fraud  *  .   key points    A representative of the Commission chairs  Cocolaf,  which consists of 2 representatives from each EU country who may be assisted by 2 representatives of the competent national authorities.   To more effectively organise close and regular cooperation between EU countries’ competent authorities to counter fraud, in accordance with  Article 325  of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Commission may consult Cocolaf on any matter relating to:   the  prevention and prosecution of fraud and all other illegal activities  that may adversely affect the EU’s financial interests;   cooperation between EU countries or between EU countries and the Commission to  protect the EU’s financial interests  .     Cocolaf supports the work of the  European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF),  which investigates corruption and misconduct within the EU institutions, as well as fraud against the EU’s budget. Cocolaf also complements the  Hercule III programme  , which funds projects that, among other things, increase anti-fraud cooperation between EU countries, the Commission and OLAF.   Cocolaf, in agreement with the Commission, may set up working parties that tackle specific issues. In this respect, the following 4 sub-groups have been created:    Fraud Prevention Group:  stimulates cooperation among the relevant national authorities of EU countries and the Commission by exchanging experiences and best practices in the field of fraud prevention (e.g.   experience with fraud risk assessments,   exchange on fraudulent practices detected,   experience with the development and implementation of national or sectoral anti-fraud strategies or policies or measures, etc.).      Reporting and Analysis of Fraudulent and Other Irregularities Group  : focuses on introducing and discussing statistical analysis of reported cases and considers other issues relevant to the preparation of the Article 325 report.    AFCOS (Anti-Fraud Coordination Service) Group:  exchanges experience and best practices in investigative cooperation between OLAF and national authorities, in line with the regulation governing OLAF’s investigations (Regulation (EU, Euratom) No  883/2013  ).    OLAF Anti-Fraud Communicators’ Network (OAFCN):  brings together spokespersons and public relations officers from relevant national authorities and OLAF to share media strategies and promote communication on preventing and deterring fraud.     The Commission arranges meetings and provides secretariat services for Cocolaf.   background   Article 325 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union requires EU countries to counter fraud at EU level in the same manner as they would counter fraud affecting their own financial interests. Meanwhile, the Commission is responsible for the proper implementation of the EU budget. For these reasons, it was decided to establish a committee covering the whole area of fraud against the EU budget.   * key terms     Fraud:  wrongful deception intended to result in financial or criminal gain.
summary of   Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union — Article 349    Communication from the Commission — A stronger and renewed strategic partnership with the EU’s outermost regions   what is the aim of the article and of the communication   The communication sets out a new approach to provide opportunities and to better address the specific needs of each of the EU’s nine outermost regions.   Article 349 acknowledges the distinctive characteristics of the EU’s outermost regions and grants them a special status that allows the EU to take specific measures to support them.   key points    Outermost regions   The European Union counts nine outermost regions:   the Azores and Madeira (Portugal);   the Canary Islands (Spain);   Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, Mayotte, Réunion, and Saint Martin (France).    Strands   The EU’s renewed strategy for the regions is based on four strands.     1.      A strong partnership between the regions, the respective EU countries and the  European Commission   . The following tools are foreseen to:    set up ad hoc platforms to exchange views on the interests and concerns of the outermost regions, bringing together itself and the national and outermost regions’ authorities, as well as other relevant players;   launch dedicated task forces to address the specific needs of an individual outermost region, as necessary;   ensure that the concerns and interests of the outermost regions are given due consideration when evaluating the impact of European policies;   pay special attention to the outermost regions’ sensitive products in the context of the negotiations of trade agreements with non-EU countries;   cooperate with the EU countries to better involve the outermost regions in negotiations regarding fisheries.        2.      Building on each region’s particular assets  . The outermost regions have very specific natural assets, including:    a rich biodiversity;   significant zones of exclusive economic activity  *  ;   a location and climate suitable for space and astrophysics activities;   a proximity to the markets of non-EU countries.    Taking these assets into account, the Commission will take a number of steps, including:    a dedicated initiative for strategic investment with the  European Investment Bank Group  to enhance access to the  European Fund for Strategic Investments  ;   considering specific measures to support  blue economy  sectors;   considering adapting State aid for the construction of new fishing vessels;   seeking to continue the EU  agricultural scheme for the outermost regions  and maintaining specific rules for the outermost regions in the  European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development  ;   considering providing specific support for the conservation of biodiversity and the sustainable use of the ecosystems services;   enhancing support and aid preparedness for the effects of  climate change  , including through the  EU Civil Protection Mechanism  ;   integrating the good practices developed by the  clean energy for EU islands  initiative throughout the EU and internationally.        3.      Enabling growth and job creation  . The Commission will:    launch a dedicated coordination and support action in the  Horizon 2020   work programme 2018-2020  to better enable the outermost regions to participate in the programme;   give particular attention to the outermost regions’ assets and specific needs when drawing the future EU research framework programmes;   intensify efforts to promote  Erasmus+  and the  European Solidarity Corps  ;   better meet the outermost regions’ needs and facilitate their participation in the  trans-European transport network programme  , the  Connecting Europe Facility  and future EU programmes for transport.        4.      Enhancing and scaling up cooperation  . The Commission will:    consider targeting new EU investments on priority and larger-scale projects in the outermost regions’ geographic basins;   facilitate cooperation between the outermost regions and their neighbours by more closely aligning funding rules and by considering setting up joint programmes;   take into account the outermost regions’ concerns when negotiating or implementing international agreements and mobility partnerships with their neighbouring countries.      background   For more information, see:    Regional policy and outermost regions  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Zones of exclusive economic activity:  An area adjacent to the continental shelf, extending up to 370 kilometres, for which a coastal country assumes jurisdiction over the exploration and exploitation of marine resources.   main documents   Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and the European Investment Bank — A stronger and renewed strategic partnership with the EU’s outermost regions (  COM(2017) 623 final  , 24.10.2017)  Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union — Part Seven — General and final provisions —  Article 349  (ex Article 299(2), second, third and fourth subparagraphs, TEC) (OJ C 202, 7.6.2016, p. 195)
act   European Parliament and Council Directive  95/16/EC  of 29 June 1995 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to lifts [  See amending acts  ].   summary   This Directive applies to lifts permanently serving buildings and constructions and the safety components used in such lifts.   Essential requirements   The Directive defines the essential requirements which must be met by lifts and their safety components in manufacture and prior to being placed on the market.  All lifts or safety components manufactured in conformity with the harmonised standards are presumed to conform to the essential health and safety requirements.   Harmonised standards   Harmonised European standards are drawn up by the European standardisation bodies on the basis of the essential requirements. The details of these non-binding standards are published in the Official Journal of the European Union.  All safety components manufactured in conformity with the harmonised standards are presumed to be such that the lifts in which they are installed satisfy the essential requirements concerned.   Conformity assessment and the CE conformity mark   Conformity assessment of lifts and safety components is carried out by:        —     either the bodies designated by EU countries in accordance with minimum assessment criteria and notified to the Commission and other EU countries;            —     or the manufacturers themselves.      Before being placed on the market, lifts and safety components must have the  CE conformity mark  affixed which:        —     attests to conformity with this Directive;            —     consists of a uniform graphic symbol, the CE mark;            —     is affixed by the manufacturers or their authorised representative established in the Community.      Where a notified body is involved in the production inspection phase, its identification number is incorporated in the CE mark.  Where lifts or safety components are subject to other Directives providing for the affixing of the CE mark, the latter indicates that they also conform to the provisions of those Directives.   The ‘Machinery’ Directive   The  Directive 2006/42/EC  aims to ensure the free movement of machines and their accessories whilst laying down essential requirements regarding the health and safety of consumers.

   Exemption for R&D agreements     Exemption for R&D agreements     This regulation provides a block exemption regulation for research and development (R&D) agreements and, in doing so, aims to ensure an effective protection of competition whilst providing adequate legal security for parties to R&D agreements.     ACT     Commission Regulation (EU) No       1217/2010      of 14 December 2010 on the application of Article 101(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to certain categories of research and development agreements.     SUMMARY     Article 101(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) is not applicable to research and development (R&D) agreements       *      . In accordance with Regulation (EEC) No       2821/71      , however, this regulation provides an exemption for R&D agreements which contain provisions relating to the assignment or licensing of intellectual property rights in order to carry out the joint R&D, paid-for R&D or joint exploitation, so long as those provisions are not the primary object of such agreements, but are instead directly related to and necessary for their implementation. The regulation also block exempts the joint exploitation of the results of R&D carried out by the parties under the regulation. This regulation replaces       Regulation (EC) No 2659/2000      , which expired on 31 December 2010.      Conditions for exemption      To be exempted, the agreement must state that all the parties have       full access      to the final results of the R&D, including any resulting intellectual property rights and know-how, for the purposes of further R&D and exploitation. If the parties limit their rights of exploitation, access to the results for the purposes of exploitation may be limited accordingly.     Where the agreement only provides for joint R&D or paid-for R&D, each party must have access to any       pre-existing know-how      of the other parties concerned, if this know-how is indispensable for the exploitation of the results. This exchange of pre-existing know-how may be compensated, but the compensation must not be so high as to effectively prevent such access.     Any joint exploitation may only concern results which are protected by intellectual property rights or constitute know-how and which are indispensable for the manufacture of the contract products or the application of the contract technologies.      Market share threshold and duration of exemption      Where the parties to the R&D agreement are not competing undertakings, the exemption provided for by this regulation is applicable for the duration of the R&D. Where the results are jointly exploited, the exemption continues to apply for       seven years      after the contract products or contract technologies are first put on the EU market.     Where the parties are competing undertakings, the exemption is applicable only if, at the time the R&D agreement is entered into:      in the case of joint R&D agreements, the combined market share of the parties does not exceed         25 %        on the relevant product and technology markets;       in the case of paid-for R&D agreements, the combined market share of the financing party and all the parties with which the financing parties has entered into R&D agreements, relating to the same contract products or contract technologies, does not exceed         25 %        on the relevant product and technology markets.      At the end of the seven years duration, the exemption shall continue to apply as long as the combined market share of the parties does not exceed 25 % on the relevant markets.      Hardcore restrictions      The exemption does not apply to R&D agreements which, directly or indirectly, in isolation or in combination with other factors under the control of the parties, have as their object:      the restriction of the freedom of the parties to carry out R&D in an unrelated field;       the restriction of the freedom of the parties to pursue R&D in a related field after the completion of the R&D agreement concerned;       the limitation of output or sales, with certain exceptions.       Excluded restrictions      The exemption does not apply to the following obligations contained in R&D agreements:      the obligation not to challenge the validity of related intellectual property rights after completion of the R&D;       the obligation not to grant licences to third parties to manufacture the contract products or to apply to contract technologies, unless the agreement provides for the exploitation of the results by at least one of the parties and such exploitation takes place in the internal market vis-à-vis third parties.        Key terms used in the act         Research and development agreement: an agreement entered into between two or more parties, relating to the conditions under which the parties pursue:            joint research and development of contract products or contract technologies and joint exploitation of the results of that research and development;             joint exploitation of the results of research and development of contract products or contract technologies jointly carried out pursuant to a prior agreement between the same parties;             joint research and development of contract products or contract technologies excluding joint exploitation of the results;             paid-for research and development of contract products or contract technologies and joint exploitation of the results of that research and development;             joint exploitation of the results of paid-for research and development of contract products or contract technologies pursuant to a prior agreement between the same parties;             paid-for research and development of contract products or contract technologies excluding joint exploitation of the results.

act   Council Regulation (EC) No  168/2007  of 15 February 2007 establishing a European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights   summary   The  Agency  for Fundamental Rights provides EU institutions and governments with assistance on  fundamental rights  when implementing EU law.   what does this regulation do  It creates a dedicated, EU-level body for fundamental rights - the Agency - and lays down its main tasks and objectives, functioning and internal governance.   key points   The regulation defines the Agency’s activities as the following:        —      supplying expertise to EU institutions and EU countries  on fundamental rights, so they can make sure any action they take or laws they pass complies with these rights,            —      formulating opinions  for EU institutions and governments either on its own initiative or at their request (for example on whether their actions or legislative proposals are compatible with fundamental rights),            —     collecting, analysing and distributing  reliable and comparable information  on the specific effects of EU action on people’s fundamental rights,            —     undertaking scientific  research and surveys  on fundamental rights,            —     issuing publications on  specific topics  or on the implementation of fundamental rights law by EU institutions and governments,            —     publishing an  annual report  on the issues covered by its remit, highlighting examples  of best practice,             —      designing communication strategies or campaigns  and promoting dialogue with civil society to  raise public awareness  of fundamental rights,            —     suggesting mechanisms for enforcing these rights.      The Agency does not, however, deal with individual complaints.   5-yearly activity plans   The Agency’s activities are based on a Multiannual Framework adopted by the EU Council which identifies the specific issues it will work on over a 5-year period, in line with the EU’s overall priorities.  These must include ‘  racism, xenophobia  and related intolerance’.   Cooperation with other bodies   The Agency must maintain close links with:        —     the  EU institutions  ,            —     EU countries’ governments and civil society groups, such as the  Fundamental Rights Platform  ,            —     equality bodies (e.g.  EU Institute for Gender Equality  or the  UN coordinating committee for National Human Rights Institutions  ),            —     international organisations (  Council of Europe  ,  United Nations  ,  Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe  ,            —      candidate countries  to the EU.      when does this regulation apply  From 23 February 2007.   background   The Agency replaced its predecessor body - the  European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia  - in Vienna, taking over its work.

   Drinking and driving: Maximum authorised level of alcohol in the blood     Drinking and driving: Maximum authorised level of alcohol in the blood     The purpose of this recommendation is to combat drinking and driving by setting a uniform maximum level of alcohol in the blood (AL) and encouraging cooperation on this matter within the Community in order to reduce public-health hazards.     ACT     Commission recommendation of January 2001 concerning the maximum authorised level of alcohol in the blood (AL) of motor-vehicle drivers [Official Journal L 43 of 14.02.2001]     SUMMARY      Context      According to estimates at least 10 000 drivers, passengers, pedestrians and cyclists suffer fatal accidents within the Community each year as a result of driver's faculties being diminished by the consumption of alcohol. The research confirms that an alcohol level of between 0.5mg/ml and 0.8 mg/ml greatly increases the risk.     Making AL uniform throughout the Community would certainly send a more powerful message and provide a clearer reference.     This recommendation forms part of the proposed       action programme      relating to public health (2001-2006) which pinpointed alcohol as an area needing specific action as part of that on road safety.      Recommended authorised level of blood alcohol      The Commission recommends two different AL within the Community. They will be applied in accordance with the criteria for drivers and vehicles.     The standard AL for all motor vehicle drivers which should be adopted by all of the Member States is one not exceeding 0.5 mg/ml. At the moment most of the Member States have already adopted that AL limit.     In addition a second AL of 0.2 mg/ml is recommended for certain types of driver and vehicle, namely:       inexperienced drivers        and more particularly holders of provisional driving licences, learner drivers accompanied by driving or trainee drivers attending a driving school and novice drivers having held a driving licence for less than two years;        motorcyclists        ;        drivers of large vehicles        , i.e. lorries weighing more than 3.5 tonnes and any passenger vehicle fitted with more than eight passenger seats;        drivers of vehicles carrying dangerous goods        , with reference to the measures set out in Directive         94/55/EC        on the carriage of dangerous goods by road.      The term "driving licence" used in this recommendation refers to the definitions set out in Directive       91/439/EEC      on driving licences.      Means of applying the AL      The recommendation feels that all of the Member States should adopt a system of random detection by analysing expelled air in order to dissuade drivers from drinking. Moreover, each driver should be exposed to a statistically real probability of being checked at least once every three years.     In addition the Commission feels that the Members States should work towards acceptance of the draft Directive on measuring instruments in order to harmonise breathalyser accuracy.      Follow      -       up at Community level      Close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission at Community level is recommended, more especially for:      exchanging information on best practice concerning, more particularly, monitoring and penalty strategies, retraining programmes and the acquisition of accident data;       supporting research and development, especially into technical means of preventing persons in a state of intoxication and persons receiving treatment for alcohol dependence from taking the wheel;       promoting publicity campaigns at European level in order to urge drivers not to consume alcohol;       providing data on all alcohol-related traffic accidents and to coordinate their use under the CARE programme in order to check the effectiveness of the policy and to provide a link with the activities under the Community's future action programme on public health.

   EU mission in Kosovo	*This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244 (1999) and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo declaration of independence.       — upholding the rule of law     EU mission in Kosovo       *      — upholding the rule of law     SUMMARY OF:      Joint Action 2008/124/CFSP — EU rule of law mission — EULEX Kosovo      WHAT IS THE AIM OF THIS JOINT ACTION?     It sets up a       European Union rule of law mission in Kosovo      , also known as EULEX Kosovo, with a mission to assist the Kosovo institutions, judicial authorities, police and other law enforcement agencies in their progress towards being sustainable and accountable. It also sets out some of the tasks to achieve this.     KEY POINTS     To achieve its aim, EULEX Kosovo is designed to further develop and strengthen an independent multi-ethnic chain of criminal justice (including customs service), free from political interference and in line with internationally recognised standards. This includes:      monitoring, mentoring and providing advice to Kosovo institutions;       ensuring the rule of law and public order, if necessary through reversing decisions previously made by the Kosovo authorities;       ensuring that war crimes, terrorism, organised crime, corruption, inter-ethnic crimes, financial/economic crimes and other serious crimes are properly dealt with, if necessary with international help and through creating cooperation and coordination structures between police and prosecutors;       contributing to the fight against corruption, fraud and financial crime;       helping to implement the         Kosovo anti-corruption strategy        ;       ensuring that activities respect human rights and gender mainstreaming; and       cooperating with judicial and law enforcement authorities of EU and non-EU countries.       Relocated judicial proceedings      As part of this mandate, EULEX Kosovo will support proceedings that are relocated to an EU country and arise from allegations in the       Council of Europe      report entitled       Inhuman treatment of people and illicit trafficking in human organs in Kosovo      of 12 December 2010. The judges and prosecutors will be fully independent.      Structure      As a       common security and defence policy      mission, EULEX Kosovo has its main headquarters in Pristina, with offices across Kosovo, as well as a Brussels support element. Operations began following the transfer of authority from the       United Nations Mission in Kosovo      .     A civilian operations commander, under the political and strategic direction of the       Political and Security Committee (PSC)      and the overall authority of the       High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy      , is in command at the strategic level, while a head of mission is responsible at the local military level.     EULEX Kosovo consists mainly of staff seconded by EU countries or institutions that will pay the cost of deployment. Seconded staff come under the full command of the national authorities or EU institution concerned, but come under the operational control of the civilian operations commander who will consult the       European Union special representative      , as required.      Security      The civilian operations commander directs the head of mission’s planning of security measures in line with EU policy under Title V of the       Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union      . Staff undergo mandatory security training before taking up their duties as well as regular updating of knowledge in the military space.      Authority      As required to implement this joint action, EULEX Kosovo is authorised to:      procure services and supplies;       enter into contracts and administrative arrangements;       employ staff;       hold bank accounts;       acquire and dispose of assets; and       be a party to legal proceedings.       Funding      The joint action sets out arrangements for the year-by-year funding of EULEX Kosovo. A project cell identifies and implements projects, coordinating and providing advice on relevant projects of EU and non-EU countries, where appropriate. It can also ask for financial contributions from these countries to implement projects in some circumstances, subject to PSC agreement.      Information and documents      The High Representative is authorised to release classified information to the       United Nations      ,       NATO/Kosovo Force      ,       Frontex      and other third parties associated with this joint action, in accordance with Decision       2013/488/EU      .      Review      The       Council      evaluates, at least 6 months before the expiry of the joint action, whether EULEX Kosovo should be extended.     FROM WHEN DOES THE JOINT ACTION APPLY?     It has applied since 4 February 2008. It will expire on 14 June 2021.     BACKGROUND     For more details, see:       EULEX Kosovo        (         European External Action Service        ).

   De minimis aid for the fisheries sector     De minimis aid for the fisheries sector     This regulation replaces the fisheries sector rules on de minimis aid in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1860/2004, which had established those rules for the agriculture and fisheries sectors.     ACT     Commission Regulation (EC) No       875/2007      of 24 July 2007 on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to de minimis aid in the fisheries sector and amending Regulation (EC) No 1860/2004.     SUMMARY     Article 87(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Community stipulates that, save as otherwise provided in the Treaty, State aid in any form whatsoever is incompatible with the common market, as it may distort competition.     However, Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No       994/98      states that the Commission may decide that certain aids do not meet all the criteria of Article 87. These aids are therefore exempted from the notification procedure.     Therefore, in the same way that the Commission in 2001 adopted the general de minimis Regulation (Commission Regulation (EC) No       69/2001      ) for all economic sectors other than the transport, agriculture and fisheries sectors, it adopted a joint de minimis Regulation for agriculture and fisheries in 2004 (Commission Regulation (EC) No       1860/2004      ) and has now adopted one specific to the fisheries sector.      De minimis ceiling      The de minimis ceiling for the fisheries sector is set at EUR 30 000 per three-year period and per beneficiary, on condition that the total amount of such aid granted to undertakings is below 2.5 % of the national annual production of the sector.      Scope      De minimis aid must be transparent aid, in other words aid for which it is possible to calculate precisely in advance the gross grant equivalent without the need to undertake a risk assessment. This is why aid in the form of capital injections or risk capital measures is not transparent aid if the capital injection is above the de minimis ceiling.     The Regulation applies to all undertakings active in the production, processing and marketing of fisheries products.     The Regulation does not apply to:      aid of an amount that is fixed on the basis of price or quantity of products put on the market;       aid favouring export-related activities;       aid contingent upon the use of domestic over imported goods;       aid granted to undertakings in difficulty with a view to their rescuing or their restructuring;       aid serving to increase fishing capacity, except for aid for modernisation over the main deck;       aid for the purchase or construction of fishing vessels.       Monitoring      Any Member State who grants de minimis aid must strictly monitor the aid granted.     It must inform the beneficiary in writing of the amount of this aid. It must also obtain from the undertaking, before the aid is granted, a declaration on other de minimis aid received in the previous two fiscal years and in the fiscal year concerned.     However, where a Member State has set up a central register of de minimis aid for the fisheries sector containing all the requested information, the above conditions shall no longer apply. To this end, the register must cover a period of three fiscal years.     The Member State may grant the aid to the undertaking in question only if this does not raise the total amount above the ceiling set for the fiscal period concerned.     Furthermore, Members States must record and compile all the information to allow the Commission to establish that the conditions of this Regulation have been complied with. The records are to be maintained for ten fiscal years. On written request from the Commission, the Member States must provide the Commission with all the information that the Commission considers necessary.

act   Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the future of carbon capture and storage in Europe (  COM(2013) 180 final  of 27.3.2013)   summary    what does the communication do  The European Commission’s communication stresses that CCS is a key technology in the transition to a competitive low-carbon economy by 2050. It is capable of reconciling rising demand for fossil fuels with the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It outlines the progress made to date and seeks the views of interested parties on a number of options to encourage the wider and commercially viable use of the technology in the European Union (EU).   key points   Globally, over 20 demonstration scale CCS projects are operating successfully. Eight of these do the full capture, transport and storage. None are in the EU.  The communication identifies obstacles to wider use of CCS:   absence of economic rationale to invest in CCS given the low level of ETS prices;   public opposition to storing CO  2  onshore (see background below);   sufficient storage capacity exists, but not all capacity is accessible or located close to CO  2  emitters;   need for international cooperation.   Funding for large-scale CCS demonstration projects is available from the  European energy programme for recovery  and the  NER300 programme  .   background   CO  2  can be stored in various places, notably oil, gas or deep saline reservoirs and unmineable coal seams. It must not come into contact with the atmosphere. Legislation in place since 2009 on the geological storage of CO  2  , known as the  CCS Directive  , stipulates how storage sites must be selected, permitted, operated and closed. They must demonstrate no significant risk of leakage or damage to human health or the environment.  A 2005  report  by the intergovernmental panel on climate change concluded that geological reservoirs, if appropriately selected and managed, are ‘very likely’ to retain over 99 % of the stored CO  2  for over 100 years and ‘likely’ to retain 99 % for longer than 1 000 years.  For more information, see the European Commission’s  carbon capture and geological storage website  .
   State aid to shipbuilding (I)     State aid to shipbuilding (I)     This Regulation aims to remove discrepancies likely to distort competition on the transport market.     ACT     Council Regulation (EC) No       3094/95      of 22 December 1995 on aid to shipbuilding [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     Regulation (EC) No       3094/95      , which was the result of an agreement concluded in 1994 within the framework of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) regarding normal competitive conditions in the commercial shipbuilding and repair industry, cannot enter into force until the agreement has been ratified by all the parties. Given the reluctance by the United States to ratify, the Council initially adopted Regulation (EC) No       1540/98      in its place. This Regulation has now expired and has been replaced by the link on       state aid to shipbuilding      .     Definition of some of the terms used in the Regulation ("shipbuilding", "ship repair", etc.).     Enumeration of the various types of aid and the conditions which must be satisfied for them to be judged compatible with the common market:      social assistance (when such aid is intended to cover the cost of measures for the exclusive benefit of workers who lose retirement benefits or who are made redundant or are otherwise permanently deprived of their employment in the respective shipbuilding, conversion or repair enterprise, when such assistance is related to the discontinuance of shipyard activities, bankruptcy, or changes in activities other than shipbuilding, conversion or repair);       research and development aid (when such aid relates to fundamental research, basic industrial research, applied research or development, provided the limits set by the Regulation are observed);       indirect aid (when this is given in the form of state loans and guarantees, as development assistance to a developing country or for the building or conversion of ships, provided the conditions laid down in the Regulation are observed).      Derogations in favour of Spain, Portugal and Belgium, whereby reconstruction aid granted in the form of investment assistance and any other aid for social measures not covered by the Regulation and granted after 1 January 1996 may be authorised, provided the conditions laid down in the Regulation are observed.

The countries or regions with the largest market shares in this sector are Japan, South Korea, China and the European Union. The sector is currently reeling from a deep crisis caused by three factors: past over-ordering, the global economic slowdown - and particularly the US slowdown - and the repercussions of September 11.     Order intake worldwide fell by 12.3% from 2001 to 2002, following a decrease of 20.7% between 2000 and 2001. European shipyards have, however, been the worst affected by this slump, with orders generally down 50% on 2001 and by over 70% compared to 2000. The hardest hit vessels are container ships and cruise ships. Only oil product tankers and bulk carriers have seen increased ordering, due to the replacement of old tonnage following new European Union maritime safety regulations and strong domestic demand in the Far East.     The main shipbuilding regions have, however, been affected in different ways: Japanese yards have the advantage of strong domestic demand, especially for bulk carriers; South Korea and China are battling for tanker contracts; and the European Union is only really active in the ferries and small tankers segment, where replacement needs are building up, although it is possible that Korean shipbuilders might try to further penetrate this market segment.     Prices: the statistics show that some categories of vessel are particularly affected by a major drop in market prices. Large container ships have seen their sales prices fall as a result of excessive price-cutting by Korean yards. The trend has been such that production costs have not always been covered. This is all the more surprising as the current weakness of the US dollar against the euro, won and yen should have led to an across-the-board increase in US dollar prices. Studies have also been carried out to investigate the relationship between the normal price, which is the full cost of production plus a profit margin of 5%, and the actual contract price charged by certain Korean shipyards. Given that production costs have risen in recent years, the gap between contract prices and normal prices has widened further. The studies are based on an analysis of several Korean yards and have revealed that the difference between the normal price and the contract price ranges from between -1% and -39%. All these results indicate a clear trend: Korean shipyards are trying to grab every order that appears in the market no matter the cost, despite assertions made to the contrary by the management of the different Korean groups. This strategy could be damaging if Korean yards fail to take certain factors into consideration, such as inflation and debt servicing, and major financial difficulties could ensue in the short term.      Sixth Commission report to the Council on the situation in world shipbuilding [         COM (2002) 622        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      Following the breakdown of two rounds of talks conducted by the Commission (26-27 August 2002 in Seoul and 24-27 September 2002 in Brussels) the Commission had no choice but to initiate proceedings with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and to start bilateral consultations with the Republic of Korea. At the same time a temporary defensive mechanism was authorised for certain market segments and for a limited period only.     The crisis in world shipbuilding is deepening with very slow order intake in the major shipbuilding regions in the first six months of 2002. The main reasons are past over-supply, slowing economies around the world and the effects of 11 September. Only Japanese yards still manage to fill building slots. However, this is helped a lot by domestic demand, in particular for bulk carriers, as has been long-standing practice in this region.     World-wide ordering of new ships in the first half of 2002 was down by almost two thirds compared to average quarterly figures in 2000, which was admittedly the best year ever for shipbuilding. In the EU the situation is even worse, with ordering down by almost 80% compared to 2000. Prices for new ships have declined further and are now at the lowest level for more than a decade. Yards in South Korea have further lowered offer prices despite increases in all major cost factors, and a number of Korean yards may find it difficult to meet their financial obligations if order intake is not increased soon.      Fifth Commission report to the Council on the situation in world shipbuilding [         COM (2002) 205        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      The world shipbuilding market continues to face serious difficulties due to a substantial imbalance of supply and demand. Past expansion of shipyards, mainly in Korea, but now increasingly also in China, has led to price depression. Thanks to a historically high level of ordering in 2000, prices recovered to some extent, but the significant drop in orders in 2001 has led to a new reduction in prices. The year 2001 has been very problematic for the maritime industries worldwide: the recession in the United States and the terrorist attacks of 11 September have reduced the demand for sea trade and cruises respectively. The decline in ordering affected the container ship and cruise ship sectors most, leading to a drop in overall market shares for Korea and the EU, which are particularly strong in these segments.     The detailed cost investigations undertaken by the Commission show that certain Korean yards continue to price ships below cost while others are trying to improve their bottom line. Despite various rounds of talks with Korea, the Commission did not manage to convince the Korean authorities and yards to fully implement market principles and allow a shake-out of non-viable companies. An improvement in the market situation is therefore unlikely and the Commission has consequently proposed counter-measures to the Council, including preparing the ground for requesting a dispute settlement at the World Trade Organisation and the introduction of a temporary defensive mechanism for shipbuilding.      Fourth Commission report to the Council on the situation in world shipbuilding [         COM (2001) 219        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      The year 2000 has seen a significant expansion in orders for new ships. Nearly 56% more orders were placed as compared to 1999, primarily benefiting South Korean shipyards, which have seen their market share increase again. EU yards also benefited considerably from the higher demand for ships, although orders for cruise ships probably played a dominant role here. In 2000 South Korea has consolidated its dominant position on the world shipbuilding market, accounting for more than 35 % of all tonnage ordered worldwide. If cruise ship orders are included, the market share for the EU and Norway is around 18 % (in cgt). However, if they are excluded from the overall figures, the market share of EU yards for new orders in 2000 is below 10 %. In 2000 prices for new ships are reported to have recovered in certain market segments from the very low levels seen after the Asian crisis in 1997.      Third Commission report on the situation in world shipbuilding [         COM (2000) 730        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      In this report the Commission confirms the general trend highlighted in the second report of 18 May 2000, namely that, despite increased orders, ship prices have not on the whole recovered the ground lost since 1997. Prices continue to be depressed owing to the very low offer prices from yards in South Korea, which is now the biggest shipbuilding country in the world. Over the first eight months of 2000, its shipyards took more than 40% of all new orders. The Commission considers the stagnation in prices to be all the more alarming in that the European Union has drastically cut back state aid to shipbuilding. Despite the signing of the Agreed Minutes in June 2000 aimed at obtaining from South Korea firm commitments on non-intervention in the financing of shipbuilding, bilateral talks ended in failure. The Commission thus plans to:      continue its monitoring of the market situation;       examine the European industry's complaint of October 2000 against Korean dumping, in order to deal with this problem under WTO rules;       remain open, at the same time, to any Korean proposals;       continue efforts to re-establish fair competition at international level;       encourage the International Monetary Fund to ensure that the restructuring of Korean shipyards is closely monitored;       continue to cooperate with the industry on competitiveness issues;       examine with the Council any possible action to address the problem.       Second Commission report on the situation in world shipbuilding [         COM (2000) 263        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      The report takes stock of the world shipbuilding market. The market is in crisis, with supply outstripping demand. Vessel prices are falling in the face of unbeatable competition from Korean yards, which are prepared to sell at a loss in order to ensure market share and cash flow. To address the problem, the European Commission obtained an agreement from the Korean authorities to restrict State financial intervention in the shipbuilding industry. The Commission also gathered evidence pointing to unfair competition, and a complaint may be filed under the Trade Barriers Regulation.      First Commission report on the situation in world shipbuilding [         COM (1999) 474        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      The report describes overcapacity on the shipbuilding market, with a marked imbalance between supply and demand caused mainly by South Korea's increased capacity. Vessel prices were between 15 and 30% down on 1998 levels, stimulating demand and increasing the Korean yards' market share. There were reasons to believe that Korean yards were offering vessels at below-retail rates.      Council Regulation (EC) No         1177/2002        of 27 June 2002 concerning a temporary defensive mechanism to shipbuilding [Official Journal No L 172 of 2.7.2002].      The commitments contained in the Agreed Minutes signed by the European Commission and the Government of the Republic of Korea on 22 June 2000 with a view to ensuring an effective price surveillance mechanism have not been effectively implemented by the Korean side and therefore a satisfactory result has not been obtained.     Consequently, despite the ban imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No       1540/98      , the 2002 Regulation introduces a temporary defensive mechanism applicable to certain segments of the market (namely container ships and product and chemical tankers) for a short and limited period authorising support of 6% of contract value before aid. The aim is to enable Community shipyards to overcome unfair Korean competition. This Regulation expires on 31 March 2004.     Last updated: 05.09.2007  
   Second progress report on economic and social cohesion     Second progress report on economic and social cohesion     1) OBJECTIVE     To update the data on economic and social cohesion presented in the first progress report of January 2002, to give a summary of the debate concerning the future of regional policy after 2006 and to indicate how the Structural Funds will support the future Member States as from their accession.     2) ACT     Commission Communication of 30 January 2003 - Second progress report on economic and social cohesion [       COM(2003) 34      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     3) SUMMARY     1. Every three years, the Commission produces a "report on the progress made towards achieving economic and social cohesion" and on the manner in which the Community policies have contributed to it (       Article 159      of the Treaty establishing the European Community). The second report on economic and social cohesion, published in January 2001, had two objectives:      to analyse the development of economic and social cohesion in a Union of 27 Member States;       to start a debate on the future of European cohesion policy.      2. Since then, the European Commission has published, in January 2002, a first progress report which updates the data collected in the Second Cohesion Report for a Europe of 25 and gives an initial assessment of the debate. In January 2003, the Commission presented a second progress report. Taking account of the most recent data on the gross domestic product (GDP) and the unemployment rate, this report deals again with the two topics discussed in the previous reports. Moreover, it indicates how the Structural Funds will intervene during the two-year-period following enlargement (2004) and the end of the current programming period (2006).      SITUATION AND TRENDS      3. Despite the fact that economic growth slowed down significantly in 2001, the general trend towards economic convergence is confirmed in the current European Union. The "cohesion countries" (Spain, Greece, Portugal and Ireland, which are eligible for the       Cohesion Fund      ) continue to catch up with their the other Member States. The GDP of Ireland has risen from 64 % of the Community average in 1988 to 118 % in 2001. While regional disparities remain unchanged on the European level, they have grown within the Member States. Moreover, statistics show that the economic catching up is a long-term process.     4. In terms of employment, a slower growth in 2001 within the Europe of 15 combined with a constant decrease in employment for five years in the candidate countries is causing a widening of regional disparities. Three million new jobs will be needed if the average level of employment in the future Member States is to be aligned on that of the EU of 15. The level of education will rise in the enlarged Union. Employment is going to increase in the agricultural sector, stagnate in industry and decrease in services.     5. In a Union of 25, three groups of countries can be distinguished:      the eight poorest future Member States whose per capita GDP is approximately 40 % of the average in the Community of 25: Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia;       an intermediate group involves countries between 71 % and 92 % of the Community's average GDP: Cyprus, Spain, Greece, Portugal, Slovenia;       the rest of the existing Member States with an average per capita GDP close to 115 % of the average EU.      6. With enlargement, the regional disparities will nearly double. Forty-eight regions in the existing Member States (18 % of the total population, i.e. 68 million inhabitants) have a per capita income less than 75 % of the Community average. In a Union of 25, the number of such regions will be 67 (25 % of the population, i. e. 116 million persons), two-thirds of which are situated in the new Member States. Only 30 regions in the current Member States (12 % of the population, i.e. 47 million) would remain under the threshold of 75 % and would thus be considered as "less-favoured areas". According to the figures of 2000, the 18 regions which would lose their status by simple "statistical effect" are the following: Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Dresden, Halle, Magdeburg and Thüringen (Germany); Burgenland (Austria); Itä-Suomi (Finland); Asturias, Murcia and Ceuta y Melilla (Spain); Basilicata (Italy); Madeira (Portugal); Hainaut, Namur (Belgium); Merseyside, West Wales, South Yorkshire (United Kingdom). Nevertheless, the data to be used in 2006 are not yet available and this list has a merely indicative character.      New indicators and studies carried out      7. New indicators on technological progress confirm that southern European countries are lagging behind in terms of technological innovation. Finland, Sweden and Germany file double the number of patents per million inhabitants than the European average, whereas in Ireland, Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal it is fewer than half the European average. Disparities are even more serious in the leading-edge technologies sector: expenditure related to research and development exceeds the threshold of 3 % of the GDP in 17 regions, out of which ten in Germany, two in Finland, two in France, and one each in the United Kingdom, Austria and Sweden. Among the candidate countries, the highest investment in this field is in the Czech Republic and Slovenia.     8. The results of the Commission study (       pdf      ) on the economic impact of Objective 1 between 2000 and 2006 are encouraging. The allocated funding steps up significantly the economic growth of the regions receiving assistance, but it also has a "knock-on effect", with one quarter of the expenditure benefiting other areas in the European Union.     9. Other studies deal with the territorial and human factors of cohesion: two of them give an overview on the situation of island and mountain areas, two others analyse the role of individuals in regional development and the emergence of a knowledge and know-how based economy. The first results of the study on islands are as follows: 10 million Europeans live in 286 European islands, out of which 9,5 million in the Mediterranean (Sicily, Crete, the Balearics and Corsica); 87 % of the EU island population is covered by Objective 1; islands with the smallest population (less than 5000 inhabitants) face most difficulties.      DEBATE ON THE FUTURE OF COHESION POLICY       The issues most widely discussed      10. The main discussion topics concerning the future of the regional policy are the following:       priority to the least developped regions        ;To define these regions, it is widely accepted to use the criterion of 75 % of the Community's average GDP applied at         NUTS II        level given its transparency and simplicity of calculation. Additional criteria may apply together with the inclusion of specific areas (islands, outermost regions, very sparsely populated regions) in this category.For the 18 regions concerned by the "statistical effect", a fair arrangement is necessary.        aid outside regions whose development is lagging behind should continue        ;A thematic approach could be applied throughout the territory. A territorial approach could focus on areas suffering from special handicaps (urban areas, rural areas, areas dependent on fishing or cross-border areas). Zoning no longer seems to be appropriate.        the exchange of experience and cooperation has a beneficial impact        ;At cross-border level, a legal instrument may be necessary.        the simplification of procedures        for policy implementation is broadly agreed upon;        a greater contribution from other Community policies        to economic and social cohesion is desirable.       Within the institutions      11. The Council welcomed the first progress report on economic and social cohesion. The delegations of Member States felt that aid to the least developed regions should remain a priority, but the eligibility criteria of this assistance as well as its use should be discussed. Community assistance in other regions remains necessary and should concentrate on measures offering high Community value added. In terms of financial effort for the future cohesion policy, the Spanish presidency (1st half of 2002) thought the threshold of 0,45 % of Community GDP to be a good reference point, other delegations, on the other hand, will take position on the issue at a later stage. Furthermore, voices calling for a certain "renationalisation" of the regional policy do not seem to have gained ground.     12. During their meeting of 7 October 2002, the Ministers responsible for regional policy expressed their wish for a greater simplification and decentralisation of responsibilities as regards all aspects of financial management and control of European programmes. Enlargement will aggravate tensions between the double need for a more decentralised implementation, on the one hand, and the need for more effective control of financial flows on the other. This development must be carried out in the light of Article 274 of the EC Treaty which gives the Commission responsibility for budgetary execution.     13. On 6 November 2002, the European Parliament adopted an opinion on the first progress report. It supports the Commission's position on the following points: the maintenance of a strong cohesion policy based on partnership, the threshold of minimum financial effort (0,45 % of the Community GDP), aid to areas with specific handicaps and greater cross-border cooperation. It also refers to the need to take account of other indicators (than per capita income) to determine the eligibility under the Structural Funds, to simplify the procedures and to strengthen the administrative capacity of the candidate countries. It asks the Commission to set out a time frame to ensure that programming for the period 2007-13 can be implemented from 1 January 2007 and to make concrete proposals on the future of Objective 2 and the Community Initiatives.     14. The European Economic and Social Committee has issued two opinions in favour of maintaining a strong regional policy after 2006 ["EU's Economic and Social Cohesion Strategy" - Official Journal C 241, 07.10.2002]. In agreement with the Parliament, the Committee is in favour of raising the threshold, which is set at 0,45 % and adopting an open method of coordination to deal with the economic and social problems which the Objective 2 regions are encountering.     15. In its opinion of 10 October 2002 on the first progress report [Not published in the Official Journal], the Committee of the Regions underlines as well the importance of assistance for less-developed regions, the coordination of Community policies and the simplification of procedures. It stresses the need to introduce a transitional support period for regions affected by the "statistical effect" of enlargement.      At the seminars of the Commission      16. The seminar on the Community added value of regional policy took place on 27 and 28 May 2002. It brought together more than 600 participants from the Member States and candidate countries. Priority to regions whose development is lagging behind, maintenance of aid outside these regions, simplification of procedures and the importance of cross-border cooperation were widely agreed upon. In the perspective of a regional policy within an enlarged Union, the role and responsibility of the Commission would have to be clarified, in particular through the elaboration of tripartite contracts between the Commission, the Member States and the regions.     17. Six hundred people involved in the       URBAN II      programme gathered in London on 8 and 9 July 2002 and noted the important contribution of this Community Initiative to urban development. It encourages a high degree of partnership and constant learning through visible interventions in the field. Local parties underlined the need to continue and step up assistance to cities, in particular in the following fields: housing, exchange of experience and networking.     18. Within the framework of the International Year of the mountains, a seminar on "Community policies and the mountain areas", held on 17 and 18 October 2002 in Brussels, brought together 500 participants from the Member States, candidate countries and elsewhere. The seminar reiterated the need for specific projects and the added value of cross-border cooperation.      2004-2006: PREPARATION FOR ENLARGEMENT      19. The Copenhagen European Council concluded the accession negotiations, thus paving the way to the accession of ten new Member States from 1 May 2004. The successful integration of these States into the enlarged Union is from now on an a key political priority. The Fifteen have thus allocated EUR 21,7 billion as additional resources for 2004-2006, though this amount is still inferior to the ceiling fixed in 1999 at the European Council in Berlin under       Agenda 2000      .     20. As identified in the regular reports of October 2002 on the preparation of the candidate countries, the most important problems concern the administrative capacity to absorb the funds provided and the implementation of financial control procedures. A final overall assessment of the preparation of the 10 future Member States is to take place six months before the actual enlargement. From now on, the future Member States have to overcome their weaknesses and finalise the programmes that they will implement from the first day of accession under the Structural and Cohesion Funds. They are also going to participate in the Community Initiatives       INTERREG III      and       EQUAL      .     21. Conscious of the       challenge of enlargement      concerning regional policy, the Commission will elaborate, taking account of the proposals emerging from the debate, its overall proposals together with a draft of financial perspective for a cohesion policy after 2006. These will be included in the Third Cohesion Report foreseen for the last quarter of 2003.     22.

act   Directive  2009/105/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 relating to simple pressure vessels.   summary   Simple pressure vessels must not endanger the safety of persons, domestic animals or property when they are properly installed, maintained and used. Thus they may not be  placed on the market or put into service  in the European Union (EU), if there is a danger of leakage or explosion.  Simple pressure vessels  manufactured in series  are welded vessels:        —     made either of non-alloy quality steel or of non-alloy aluminium or non-age hardening aluminium alloys;            —     subjected to an internal gauge pressure greater than 0.5 bar;            —     intended to contain air or nitrogen;            —     not intended to be fired.      The Directive does not apply to:        —     vessels designed for nuclear use;            —     vessels intended for installation in or for the propulsion of ships and aircraft;            —     fire extinguishers.       Essential safety requirements   Harmonised European standards are established by European Standards Organisations, in line with the safety requirements laid down in Annex I of this Directive. These safety requirements concern in particular the materials that should be used, standards that are to be complied with when vessels are designed, for manufacturing processes and the putting into service of the products.  If the Commission or an EU country considers that the standards established do not comply with the safety requirements, they may refer the matter to the  Standing Committee on standards and technical regulations  .   Certification procedure   Prior to manufacturing, the manufacturer must apply to an inspection body authorised at national level to assess the conformity of their product with safety requirements.   ‘CE’ marking   Products complying with the essential safety requirements relating to marketing and placing on the market shall bear  ‘CE’marking  . This marking must be visible, legible and indelible and must be accompanied by the information set out in Annex II to the Directive.  However, if a product with CE marking nevertheless presents a danger, the authorities of EU countries may withdraw it from the market. The country which takes these measures must inform the Commission thereof. The Commission will in turn inform the other EU countries.   Repeal   Directive 2009/105/EC is repealed by Directive  2014/29/EU  with effect from 20 April 2016.

   Coordination instrument     Coordination instrument     The European Union wishes to ensure coordination and coherence between the forms of aid granted in the framework of the pre-accession strategy under the Phare programme, the agricultural instrument (SAPARD) and the structural instrument (ISPA).     ACT     Council Regulation (EC) No       1266/1999      of 21 June 1999 on coordinating aid to the applicant countries in the framework of the pre-accession strategy and amending Regulation (EEC) No       3906/89      .     SUMMARY     A key element of the pre-accession strategy, as defined by the Luxembourg European Council, are the Accession Partnerships established by Regulation No       622/98      on assistance to the applicant countries. The Luxembourg European Council also advocated a substantial increase in pre-accession aid so as to include, in addition to the PHARE programme, an instrument for aid to agriculture (SAPARD) and a structural instrument (ISPA) for financing schemes similar to the       Cohesion Fund      .     In order to prevent duplication, to foster complementarity and to enhance the economic impact of the three different Community measures, the Regulation is aimed at improving coordination between the three instruments.      The three pre      -       accession instruments and eligible measures        The agricultural pre-accession instrument (         SAPARD         )       is intended to finance measures to support agriculture and rural development, as provided for in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No       1268/1999      , with a view to improving farm structures, the processing and marketing of agricultural and fishery products, plant-health and veterinary controls and food quality controls. Integrated rural development measures, including rural infrastructures and agri-environmental measures, are also financed under the instrument.       The structural pre-accession instrument (         ISPA         )       , which was established by Regulation (EC) No       1267/1999      , is designed to finance investment projects, i.e.:      environmental measures enabling the beneficiary countries to comply with the requirements of Community environmental law and with the objectives of the Accession Partnerships;       transport infrastructure measures, in particular those that constitute projects of common interest according to the criteria laid down in Council Decision         No 1692/96        and those which enable the beneficiary countries to comply with the objectives of the Accession Partnerships. These include measures to ensure the interconnection and interoperability of national networks both with each other and with the trans-European networks, and to provide access to such networks.        The         PHARE         programme       was set up under Regulation (EEC) No       3906/89      , as last amended by the present Regulation, which provides that funding under the PHARE programme must focus on the main priorities for the adoption of the Community       acquis      , i.e. building up the administrative and institutional capacities of the applicant States and financing investment, excluding the types of investment financed under the two instruments mentioned above. The PHARE programme can also be used to finance environmental, transport, agricultural and rural development measures which form an indispensable part of industrial reconstruction or regional development programmes.      Implementing procedures      Only one of the abovementioned instruments may be used to fund a given measure. The financing of schemes or measures is subject not only to compliance with the provisions of this Regulation but also to compliance with the undertakings contained in the Europe Agreements as set out in Regulation (EC) No       622/98      and with the conditions laid down in the Accession Partnerships.     The Regulation also provides that beneficiary States are to contribute to the financing of investments. Schemes or measures financed under the three instruments must comply with the regulations relating to those instruments.     The Commission is responsible for coordinating operations under the three instruments. In particular, it establishes the pre-accession aid guidelines for each country. It is assisted in this task by the PHARE Management Committee set up by Regulation (EEC) No       3906/89      (PHARE).     The Commission informs the Committee of any decisions concerning the indicative financial allocations for each country and per pre-accession instrument and of any measures taken to ensure coordination and coherence between operations undertaken under the three instruments and between the latter and operations funded via the European Investment Bank, other Community financial instruments or international financial institutions. Such decisions are communicated to the Court of Auditors. The Commission and the Court of Auditors may, if necessary, carry out on-the-spot inspections.      Procedure and derogations      Project selection, tendering and contracting by applicant countries is subject to an       ex ante      assessment procedure by the Commission.     A derogation is, however, possible: the Commission may allow implementing agencies in applicant countries to manage the aid on a decentralised basis. Its decision is based on a case-by-case analysis of national and sectoral programme/project management capacity, financial control procedures and structures regarding public finance.     The decision is subject to the minimum criteria and conditions for decentralised management of aid as set out in the Annex to the Regulation. The derogation must also take account of specific provisions concerning invitations to tender, scrutiny and evaluation of tenders, the award of contracts and the implementation of Community public procurement directives.     The rules governing inspection and evaluation are adopted by the Commission.      Information      The Commission is required to present to the European Parliament and to the Council an annual report on all the pre-accession aid granted to each country.

It is intended to provide a simpler and more effective, rationalised framework. The IPA replaces Phare, ISPA, SAPARD, CARDS and some other Regulations.     Last updated: 24.01.2007  
summary of   Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 — rules on the EU’s uniform format for visas   what is the aim of this regulation  In 1995, the EU created a uniform format for an EU visa taking the form of a sticker to be affixed to the travel document of non-EU nationals under visa obligation.  This regulation lays down the rules for the uniform format for visas, not only for the Schengen countries  *  but also for Ireland and the United Kingdom (   1   ).   key points   The uniform format applies to:   an intended stay in one or more countries of the Schengen area of no more than 3 months in total;   a transit through the international transit areas of airports of the Schengen countries (‘airport transit visa’).   In the case of the Schengen countries, for example, a short-stay visa issued by one of them entitles its holder to travel throughout the 26 countries for up to 90 days within a 180-day period.  Visas for visits exceeding that period remain subject to national procedures (i.e. to allow its holder to take up employment or establish a business, trade or profession).   Information on the visa sticker   The uniform  visa sticker  specifies the number of days that a non-national of an EU country may stay in the Schengen area and in Ireland and the United Kingdom (   1   ). In the case of a Schengen visa, the days should be counted from the date he or she enters the Schengen area (the entry stamp) to the date they exit the Schengen area (the exit stamp), both days included.  The precise length of validity of the visa is indicated on the visa sticker under the heading ‘  Duration of stay  ’.  Regulation (EU)  2017/1370  introduces a new design for the visa sticker with  additional safety features  to prevent forgery. Ireland and the United Kingdom (   1   ) are not subject to the application of the new measures which came into force on 17 August 2017. Nevertheless, these countries may request the  European Commission  to enter into agreements in order to exchange technical information in the model of their national visas.   Technical specifications   The uniform visa must conform to:   a list of technical specifications concerning universally recognisable security features clearly visible to the naked eye including:   an integrated photograph produced to high security standards,   the logo consisting of a letter or letters indicating the issuing country - or group of countries, in the case of the Benelux;     other technical specifications which aim to prevent counterfeiting and falsification of the visa and provide methods to fill in the visa.   Each EU country must designate only one authority for printing visas. It must communicate the name of this body to the Commission and the other EU countries.  Technical specifications for the new visa sticker will be set out in a Commission implementing decision. The regulation will apply no later than 15 months after the adoption of the additional technical specifications referred to in Regulation (EC) No 1683/95.   from when does this regulation apply  It has applied since 3 August 1995.   background   For more information, see:    Visa policy  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Schengen countries:  Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.
   Strategy for sustainable development     Strategy for sustainable development     The European Union has formulated a long-term strategy to dovetail the policies for economically, socially and environmentally sustainable development, its goal being sustainable improvement of the well-being and standard of living of current and future generations.     ACT     Commission Communication of 15 May 2001 ‘A Sustainable Europe for a Better World: A European Union Strategy for Sustainable Development’ (Commission proposal to the Gothenburg European Council) [       COM(2001) 264      final – not published in the Official Journal].     Commission Communication of 13 December 2005 on the review of the Sustainable Development Strategy – A platform for action [       COM(2005) 658      final – not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This strategy provides an EU-wide policy framework to deliver sustainable development, i.e. to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.     It rests on four separate pillars – economic, social, environmental and global governance – which need to reinforce one another. The economic, social and environmental consequences of all policies thus need to be examined in a coordinated manner and taken into account when those policies are being drawn up and adopted. The EU also needs to assume its international responsibilities with regard to sustainable development, whose various aspects – including democracy, peace, security and liberty – need to be promoted beyond EU borders.     This strategy, which complements the Lisbon Strategy, shall be a catalyst for policy makers and public opinion, to change society’s behaviour. It is built around measures covering the main challenges identified, as well as cross-cutting measures, adequate funding, the involvement of all stakeholders and effective policy implementation and follow-up.     The strategy is based on the following guiding principles: promotion and protection of fundamental rights, solidarity within and between generations, the guarantee of an open and democratic society, involvement of citizens, involvement of businesses and social partners, policy coherence and governance, policy integration, use of best available knowledge, the precautionary principle and the polluter-pays principle.      Measures for responding to the key challenges      The strategy identifies seven unsustainable trends on which action needs to be taken. This strategy lists a whole range of operational and numerical targets and specific measures at EU level to attain these objectives. These measures were updated and developed in the 2005 strategy review.     The first long-term specific objective of the strategy is to limit       climate change      and its effects by meeting commitments under the       Kyoto Protocol      and under the framework of the       European Strategy on Climate Change      . Energy efficiency, renewable energy and transport will be the subject of particular efforts.     Limiting the adverse effects of       transport      and reducing regional disparities is another long-term objective, for which there is a need to break the link between economic growth and transport growth and do more to develop transport that is environmentally friendly and conducive to health. The strategy envisages, among other measures, infrastructure charging, promotion of alternatives to road transport and vehicles which produce less pollution and use less energy.     To promote more sustainable       modes of production and consumption      the link between economic growth and environmental degradation needs to be broken and attention paid to how much ecosystems can tolerate. With this aim in view, the EU must among other things promote green public procurement, define environmental and social performance targets for products in cooperation with stakeholders, expand the distribution of environmental innovations and environmental technologies and produce information about and appropriate labelling of products and services.      Sustainable management of natural resources      is also an objective. From now until 2010 overexploitation needs to be avoided, efficiency of natural resource use improved, the value of ecosystem services recognised and loss of biodiversity halted. In particular the EU must make efforts in agriculture, fisheries and forest management; see to it that the Natura 2000 network is completed; define and implement priority actions to protect biodiversity, and make sure that aspects associated with the seas and oceans are duly taken into account. Recycling and re-use must also be supported.     Limiting major threats to       public health      is another of the strategy’s objectives. Food safety and quality must be ensured throughout the food chain. Threats to health and the environment posed by chemicals must be removed by 2020 and research into the links between health and pollutants must be developed. Issues relating to epidemics, resistance to antibiotics and lifestyle must be tackled, in particular to prepare for a possible pandemic and combat HIV/AIDS.     In order to combat       social exclusion and poverty      and mitigate the effects of an ageing society, the EU must promote active ageing and make efforts to ensure the viability of pension and social protection systems, integrate legal migrants and develop a Community immigration policy, improve the situation of families – especially of children – and promote equality between men and women.     The revised strategy also provides for strengthening       the fight against global poverty      , monitoring global sustainable development and compliance with international commitments. To achieve this, the EU must in particular increase the amount of aid provided to less favoured countries, improve the coherence and quality of development aid policies and promote better international governance.      Intersectoral measures      The       Knowledge Society      must be the driving force behind sustainable development. Special efforts need to be made in education and training for the greatest number of participants, so as to bring about a change in behaviour and give the public the necessary skills to meet the objectives laid down in the strategy. Scientific and technical innovation also needs to be stimulated, especially through framework programmes of research and development and in association with universities, research institutes, businesses and government officials.      Financial and economic instruments      are another way to engender a market that offers less polluting products and services and to change consumer behaviour. Prices therefore need to reflect actual environmental and social costs, whereas fiscal measures should be applied to energy and resource consumption and/or pollution. In addition, financial support from European funds must be coordinated between the Commission and Member States to optimise efficiency.     Better       communication      will help involve businesses and the public. Stress is laid on the importance of systematic dialogue with consumers and of consulting other countries in order to mobilise the efforts of all parties. The different parties, including public administrations (European and national), businesses and the public (including non-governmental organisations) must establish partnerships among themselves.      Formulation of policies and review of progress      Member States must draw up national strategies and regularly review progress accomplished. They must carry out impact assessments before adopting their policies or committing public funds.     All the instruments available to the public authorities must be used to contribute to sustainable development. This includes regulations, but also incentives or market based instruments.     The Commission evaluates the implementation of the strategy once every two years on the basis of       sustainable development indicators      that it has adopted and, where necessary, updated. This evaluation forms the basis of another, carried out once every two years by the December European Council. Other bodies and institutions also examine what has been achieved and establish links with Member States and the public if required. The strategy provides for a review of its objectives by Council decision no later than 2011.      Background      The main lines of the strategy that the Commission proposed in 2001 were set out in the conclusions of the       Gothenburg European Council      of June 2001. It also formed part of the European Union’s preparatory work for the 2002 world summit on sustainable development (Rio + 10) held in Johannesburg. Before that summit the Commission presented another communication on how the Union should contribute towards sustainable development in the world; elements of that communication were incorporated into the strategy when it was reviewed.     A public consultation on the sustainable development strategy was organised following the appointment of the new Commission in 2004. The Commission also drew up a communication taking an overall look at the progress made thanks to the sustainable development strategy, referring to the main findings of the consultation and setting out broad orientations for review of the strategy.     For its part, the Brussels European Council of June 2005 reaffirmed both the key objectives of sustainable development and the guiding principles which need to underpin the renewed strategy.     In December 2005, the Commission adopted a communication in which it:      determines the main areas which require a fresh impetus in the years to come. It points out that these areas are interdependent and require responses based on cooperation and solidarity, on research and innovation and on the education of the population;       proposes to take more account of the impact of European policies on sustainable development at world level;       proposes methods to measure the progress achieved and regularly review priorities at national and Community levels;       recommends a permanent dialogue with the individuals and organisations – company heads, regional and local authorities, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), etc. – involved in sustainable development.      This communication underpinned the adoption of a new EU Sustainable Development Strategy at the       Brussels European Council      of June 2006.     RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 24 July 2009 - Mainstreaming sustainable development into EU policies : 2009 Review of the European Union Strategy for Sustainable Development [         COM(2009) 400        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      This Review reports on the policy developments carried out at European level following the adoption of the European Union Strategy for Sustainable Development. In this regard, the European Union plays an important role in the fight against climate change and in promoting a low-carbon economy.     However, progress in sustainable development still needs to be made and the Review opens a discussion on how the strategy can be improved. It should be better coordinated with other European policy strategies, particularly with the Lisbon Strategy on Growth and Jobs. The implementation of the strategy should be streamlined in order to improve its management and its actual results.      Commission Communication of 22 October 2007 ‘Progress Report on the Sustainable Development Strategy 2007’ [         COM(2007) 642        final – not published in the Official Journal].      In this report the Commission considers that progress achieved on the ground has been modest, but great advances in EU and Member State policy development have occurred in many areas, in particular climate change, clean energy and health.      Commission Communication of 9 February 2005 ‘The 2005 Review of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy: Initial Stocktaking and Future Orientations’ [         COM(2005) 37        final – not published in the Official Journal].      The Commission takes stock of progress since 2001, even though immediate results cannot be expected. The Commission also sets out the future orientations which should guide the review of the strategy, specifically:      reaffirming the new approach to policy making and policy coherence (impact assessment, stakeholder consultation, regulatory simplification, market-based instruments);       pursuing action on key unsustainable trends (assessment of these trends and the linkages between them);       setting new priority objectives and targets, together with intermediate milestones to measure progress;       reinforcing the monitoring of the strategy;       strengthening ownership of the strategy (awareness-raising and mobilisation) and improving cooperation with public and private actors.       Sustainable development indicators to monitor the implementation of the EU sustainable development strategy [SEC(2005) 161 - not published in the Official Journal].      The Commission presents a list of indicators for monitoring the implementation of the political priorities which were agreed at the Gothenburg and Barcelona European Councils or which relate to the commitments entered into by the European Union at the Johannesburg world summit on sustainable development. The list takes the form of a hierarchical framework of 12 headline indicators (corresponding to the main sustainable development themes identified at European and international level), 45 core policy indicators (corresponding to the key objectives of each theme) and 98 analytical indicators (corresponding to measures implementing the key objectives).

act   Council Directive  67/548/EEC  of 27 June 1967 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances.   summary   The directive on dangerous substances (DSD) is the first harmonisation text in the field of chemical products. It requires suppliers to classify, label and package dangerous substances according to harmonised rules. The aim is to better protect people and the environment from risks posed by these products, along with ensuring free movement of the products.  The entry into force, in January 2009, of Regulation (EC) No  1272/2008  on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures (CLP regulation) began a  transitional period during which both systems were in operation  . This means the CLP regulation, having already replaced many of the provisions in the DSD, will replace it permanently from  1 June 2015  .   Definitions and scope   The DSD applies to  substances  , i.e. chemical elements and their compounds as present in their natural state or as produced by industry.  Preparations  , i.e. mixtures or solutions composed of two or more substances, are covered by Directive  1999/45/EC  (  DPD  ).  In accordance with the directive, substances belonging to one of the following 15 hazard categories are considered  dangerous  :   explosive;   oxidising;   highly flammable, easily flammable or flammable;   very toxic or toxic;   harmful;   corrosive;   irritant;   sensitising;   carcinogenic;   mutagenic;   toxic for reproduction;   hazardous to the environment.   Certain products are specifically excluded from the scope of the text (e.g. medicines and cosmetics, radioactive substances, waste products, etc.). Neither does the text apply to the transport of dangerous goods. In this area, the regulations in force are based on international texts.   Double classification until 1 June 2015   A substance’s classification reflects both the type and level of the substance’s hazard, i.e. the potential risks to humans or to the environment. Suppliers of chemical products must classify these before placing them on the market, whether they consist of substances:   for which classification is  harmonised  and as such is obligatory for suppliers (see Annex VI of the  CLP Regulation  which contains lists of dangerous substances for which classification has been harmonised in accordance with the DSD and the CLP Regulation respectively); or,   that suppliers must  self-classify  in relation to specific criteria, consisting of the 15 hazard categories defined in the directive (see above) or the 28 hazard classes which replaced them in the  CLP Regulation  .    Phase-in period   Since 1 December 2010 and until 1 June 2015, substances must be classified according to both the DSD and the  CLP Regulation  . In particular, this means that during this period both classifications must appear together in the  safety data sheets  . These sheets contain information on the substance’s properties, hazards, handling precautions, etc. and their aim is to ensure its safe use.   Packaging and labelling   Labelling is the main source of essential, concise information given to the user on the hazards relating to a substance and on the precautions required while using it. A supplier must therefore label all packaging containing a substance classed as dangerous before placing it on the market.  Since 1 December 2010, substances must be labelled and packaged in accordance with the  CLP Regulation  which repealed and replaced the provisions of the DSD.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 — materials and articles intended to come into contact with food   summary    what does this regulation do   It lays down common rules for packaging materials and articles such as bottles and containers, which come, or may come, into contact with food, either directly or indirectly.   It seeks to protect human health and consumers’ interests as well as ensure that the products used may be sold anywhere in the European Economic Area – an area comprising the 28 EU countries (   1   ), Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway in which there is free movement of persons, goods, services and capital.   key points    The legislation identifies 17 groups of materials and articles, ranging from cork and glass to plastic and textiles, where specific measures may be adopted.   These may include measures such as purity standards and a list of the substances used.   An application for the use of a new substance must be submitted to the relevant national authority which then forwards it to the  European Food Safety Authority  for its opinion.   Materials used for packaging must be identified as ‘for food contact’ and accompanied by a suitable logo such as a coffee machine, wine bottle or soup spoon.   Traceability measures must be in place to make it possible to recall any defective products or provide the public with specific information.   National authorities may suspend the use of a particular material if detailed grounds emerge that it might endanger human health.

act   Regulation (EC) No  294/2008  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2008 establishing the European Institute of Innovation and Technology.   summary   The EIT promotes integration, synergies and cooperation between the three elements of the knowledge triangle - education, research and innovation - by promoting excellence, based on the strategic networks created in this way.  Amongst other things, it contributes to the funding of ‘knowledge and innovation communities’ (or KICs), made up of higher education establishments, companies, research institutes and other parties working together on innovative projects.   Main objectives   The main objectives of the EIT are the following:   identify its priority areas and activities;   raise awareness amongst potential partner organisations;   select, design and coordinate KICs;   raise the necessary funds from public and private sources;   promote recognition within the EU of titles and diplomas issued by partner higher education establishments whose diplomas are issued by the EIT;   promote dissemination of best practices to put in place a common culture of innovation and knowledge transfer;   become a global benchmark as an body of excellence in the fields of higher education, research and innovation;   encourage recourse to multidisciplinary approaches to innovation;   ensure complementarity and synergies between its activities and other EU programmes;   put in place a stakeholder forum.    Governance   The EIT was created in 2008 and is based in Budapest, Hungary, as an  independent  community body. Its activities are carried out in line with actions at regional, national and intergovernmental level. The EIT possesses legal personality. It has a specific statute which sets out its operations and the responsibilities of its main actors, including the management committee, the director and the internal auditing function.   Knowledge and innovation communities (KICs)   The EIT relies on KICs or independent partnerships of higher education establishments, research institutes, companies and other stakeholders in the innovation process in the form of  strategic networks  .  The main responsibilities of KICs include:   innovative activities and investments with European added value;   ground-breaking scientific research (‘high technology’) which aims to address the essential interests of the economy (such as raw materials) or society (such as health);   university-level education and training activities (Master’s and doctoral levels) and professional training;   raising awareness and disseminating best practices.   The KICs are funded by the EIT and are selected via calls for proposals. They have a great degree of freedom to define their legal form and composition.  In principle, the period of activity of a KIC is 7 to 15 years, with the possibility of extension.  A KIC must include at least three partner organisations, each independent from the others and established in at least three different EU countries. At least two thirds of the partner organisations which make up a KIC must be established in EU countries. Each KIC comprises, at minimum, one higher education establishment and one private company.   EIT strategic innovation programme for 2014-20   The EIT’s priorities, long-term strategy and financial needs, amongst other things, are outlined in the 7-year strategic innovation programmes (SIPs). Based on these SIPs, the EIT adopts a 3-year work programme, including an assessment of its funding needs and sources.  For the 2014-20 period, the EIT’s objectives and performance indicators are defined in the  Horizon 2020  programme.  Additional information can be found on the  EIT  website.

act   Directive  2014/35/EU  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to the making available on the market of electrical equipment designed for use within certain voltage limits.   summary   European Union policy on the sale of electrical equipment designed for use within certain voltage limits aims to ensure high levels of protection of health and safety of persons, and of domestic animals and property.   what does this directive do  The directive creates uniform conditions throughout the EU for the sale of electrical equipment designed for use within certain voltage limits. It applies to electrical equipment designed for use with a voltage rating of between 50 and 1 000 V for alternating current and between 75 and 1 500 V for direct current.  It covers all health and safety risks, thus ensuring that electrical equipment is used safely and for the applications for which it was made.   key points   The directive lays down the responsibilities of manufacturers, importers and distributors in regard to the sale of electrical equipment designed for use within certain voltage limits:   all electrical equipment on sale in the EU must bear the  CE conformity marking  to show it meets all the essential safety requirements of EU legislation;   before obtaining the CE marking, the manufacturer must conduct a safety and conformity assessment, establish the technical documentation demonstrating the compliance of the equipment and issue and sign a EU declaration of conformity;   importers must check whether manufacturers have carried out the conformity assessment procedure correctly and inform the authority monitoring safety if they consider that equipment does not conform to the essential safety requirements;   the EU declaration of conformity and the technical documentation must be kept for 10 years;   instructions and safety information must be written in a language easily understood by end users as determined by the national authority concerned;   manufacturers and importers must indicate their contact details on their electrical equipment;   In addition, the directive specifies the steps to be taken by national authorities who monitor safety to identify and prevent the sale of dangerous electrical equipment in the EU.   when does the directive apply  This directive applies from 20 April 2016. It repeals  Directive 2006/95/EC  with effect from 20 April 2016.   background   The directive updates EU rules for the sale of electrical equipment designed for use within certain voltage limits. This is part of the effort to modernise EU law in a wide variety of industrial sectors in order to reduce administrative burdens and to establish clearer and more consistent rules.  Further information is available on the  European Commission’s Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs  website.

act   Report from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: EU citizenship report 2013 - EU citizens: your rights, your future (  COM(2013) 269  final - not published in the Official Journal)   summary   EU citizenship and the rights that go with it, such as the rights to free movement and strong political rights, are key pillars of the European Union. All nationals of an EU country enjoy this status, which adds to and does not replace national citizenship.  The  EU citizenship report  sets out concrete actions to improve EU citizens’ rights in a number of areas. The aim is to ensure that EU citizens can effectively enjoy their rights in everyday life when working, studying, living, travelling or shopping in the EU and when participating in the EU’s decision-making process.   12key actions   In the 2013 report, the Commission proposes 12 new key actions to remove obstacles to citizens’ enjoyment of their EU rights. These cover 6 areas:   removing obstacles for workers and trainees in the EU;   cutting red tape in the Member States;   protecting the more vulnerable in the EU;   eliminating barriers to shopping in the EU;   targeted and accessible information in the EU;   participating in the democratic life of the EU.   Many of the proposals apply to all 500 million EU citizens. Some of them especially benefit the more than 13.6 million EU citizens who live in a different EU country to that in which they were born, or the 210 million who travel within the EU each year for business, studies, training or leisure.  All 25 concrete actions in the first EU citizenship report of 2010 have now been launched. A table of  progress  shows initiatives taken. They cover freedom of movement and residence of EU citizens, consular protection, electoral rights and the  European citizens’ initiative  , health and consumers’ rights.  The 2013 report was prepared on the basis of a major  public consultation  involving citizens, civil society and other EU institutions. It also responds to the enquiries or complaints that the Commission receives annually from EU citizens, via the  Europe Direct  information service and the  Your Europe  portal.  The 2013 EU citizenship report is accompanied by the  report on progress towards effective EU citizenship 2011-13  (under Article 25 TFEU), which outlines how the Treaty provisions on EU citizenship (Title II of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) were implemented since 2011.
summary of   Decision 2008/114/EC, Euratom establishing Statutes for the Euratom Supply Agency    Article 52 of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) Treaty   what is the aim of this decision  It establishes Statutes for the  Euratom Supply Agency (ESA)  , which was directly established by the  Euratom Treaty  of 1957, to take account of the increase in the number of EU countries as well as to modernise the Agency’s financial rules and establish its headquarters in Luxembourg.  Article 52 of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) Treaty, which seeks to guarantee, by means of a common supply policy, a regular and equitable supply of nuclear materials to users in the EU countries, is the legal basis of ESA.   key points   ESA is the body in the EU responsible for the management of supply and demand of:   mineral ores;   source materials (natural uranium, for example);   special fissile materials (enriched uranium and plutonium, for example).   ESA has the exclusive right to ‘conclude’ (i.e. countersign) contracts relating to the supply of nuclear materials, as above, coming from both inside and outside the EU. It has also, under the Euratom Treaty, a right of option to acquire nuclear materials.  ESA has legal personality (i.e. it is an independent entity in its own right).   Objectives and tasks   ESA:   receives all contracts relating to the supply of nuclear materials within the EU; following assessment, ESA’s Director-General decides whether, or not, to grant the Agency’s countersignature, which is a necessary condition for their validity;   is notified of all contracts relating to services provided in the nuclear sector.   In addition, ESA:    provides the EU with expertise, information and advice  on the nuclear materials and services market;    monitors the nuclear market and identifies market trends  that could affect the security of the EU’s supply of nuclear materials and services;   publishes annually a report of its activities in the previous year as well as its work programme for the coming year, which are both submitted to the  European Parliament  , the  Council  and the  European Commission  ;   works in close cooperation with its   Advisory Committee   .   The ESA may also build up its own stock of nuclear materials. It is supervised by the Commission, which has the right to issue  directives  (i.e. instructions) to it and veto its  decisions  .   Legal status and HQ   ESA:   is  non-profit making  ;   is based in  Luxembourg  ;   may on its own initiative  take any further measures concerning its own internal organisation  to carry out its tasks within and outside the EU;   operates under the  most extensive legal capacity available  under each EU country’s laws and may, in particular, acquire or dispose of property and be a party to legal proceedings.    Director-General and staff   The ESA’s Director-General is responsible for:   ensuring the  performance of the Agency’s tasks  ;   exercising the ESA’s  exclusive right to conclude supply  contracts for nuclear materials and its right of option;   day-to-day  administration and management  of the Agency’s resources;   keeping the Agency’s  Advisory Committee   regularly informed  and consulting it on relevant matters;   preparing draft estimates of ESA  revenue and expenditure  , and execution of its budget;   conducting  studies and producing reports  (including an annual report) in cooperation with the Committee and their transmission to the European Parliament, the Council or the Commission.   The Director-General and ESA staff are European Commission officials and are subject to security clearance.   Finance   ESA is:   financially  autonomous  ;   is directly governed by the financial rules which apply to the  EU’s general budget  (currently,  Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046  ).   The Agency’s revenue consists nowadays, exclusively of a contribution from the EU.  ESA’s budget is adopted by the Commission and becomes final following the definitive adoption of the general budget of the EU.  Following Croatia's accession to the EU, ESA’s capital is set at €5,856,000, subscribed by individual EU countries. Luxembourg and Malta do not take part.   Advisory Committee   EU countries (with the exception of Luxembourg and Malta) each select between 1 and 4 representatives to the Advisory Committee, in line with the Agency’s Statutes. The Committee members are appointed on the basis of their experience and expertise in nuclear materials trading or nuclear power generation or regulation.  The Committee is normally convened by ESA’s Director-General twice a year. It has to be consulted before important decisions (on matters listed in ESA’s Statutes) are adopted by the Agency’s Director-General.  The Committee assists ESA by giving opinions and providing analyses and information.   from when does this decision apply  It has applied since March 2008 and, in its revised version following the accession of Croatia, since 1 July 2013.   background   For more information, see:    Euratom  (  European Commission  )    Euratom Supply Agency  (  European Commission  ).   main documents   Council  Decision 2008/114/EC, Euratom  of 12 February 2008 establishing Statutes for the Euratom Supply Agency (OJ L 41, 15.2.2008, pp. 15-20)  Successive amendments to Decision 2008/114/EC, Euratom have been incorporated in the original text.

summary of   Directive 2001/112/EC relating to fruit juices and certain similar products intended for human consumption   what is the aim of the directive  It sets out specific rules regarding the composition of fruit juices, their reserved names, their manufacturing characteristics and their labelling.   key points.    Fruit juices   The products covered by this directive are:   fruit juice,   fruit juice from concentrate,   concentrated fruit juice,   dehydrated/powdered fruit juice,   water-extracted fruit juice, and   fruit nectar.   These products are defined on the basis of their composition and preparation processes so as to ensure that the terms are used correctly in trade, and not in a manner which may mislead consumers. The directive also defines particular (traditional) designations used in certain countries and languages.   Labelling    Fruit juices are labelled in accordance with the general rules laid down in Regulation (EU) No  1169/2011  on the labelling of foodstuffs (see  summary  ). However, additional, specific rules are adopted in this directive in order to improve consumer information. These require to make it clear in the product name:   if a product is a mixture of different fruits;   if a product has been obtained entirely or partly from a concentrate.     Since amending Directive  2012/12/EU  was adopted, the addition of sugars is no longer authorised in  fruit juices  . For other products, added sugars should continue to be labelled in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011. Since the addition of sugars was previously allowed, it was common that some food-business operators labelled the absence of added sugars in the fruit juices for commercial reasons by means of nutrition claim ‘with no added sugars’. The use of this claim was disallowed after the end of a transitional period of 18 months.   To enable the industry to properly inform consumers both during the transitional period and another 18 months after its end, food-business operators could use a statement on the labels informing consumers that, from a certain date, no fruit juices contain added sugars.   For products manufactured from  2 or more fruits  , except where lemon and/or lime juice are used, the product name must be composed of a list of the fruits used, in descending order of the volume of the fruit juices or purées included, as indicated in the list of ingredients.   In the case of products manufactured from  3 or more fruits  , the indication of the fruits used may be replaced by the words ‘several fruits’ or a similar wording, or by the number of fruits used.   In the case of  concentrated fruit juice  , if the product is not intended for delivery to the final consumer, the labelling must indicate the presence and quantity of added lemon juice, lime juice or acidifying agents on the packaging, on a label attached to the packaging, or on an accompanying document.   The directive lists the  raw materials  which may be used to manufacture juice and nectar, and also the additives which may be authorised, subject to Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 on the labelling for foodstuffs.   The  minimum content of fruit juice and/or fruit purée  in fruit nectar must conform to the levels indicated in the directive and must be stated in the product labelling.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 12 January 2002 and had to become law in the EU countries by 11 July 2003.   background   For more information, see:    Food information to consumers — legislation  (  European Commission  ).
   Towards a new financial framework 2007-2013     Towards a new financial framework 2007-2013     The European Commission is presenting its proposals for the next financial framework of the European Union, which will set out the objectives and budgetary resources for the European Union for the period 2007-2013. According to this framework, EU activity should be concentrated primarily on the objectives of competitiveness and cohesion, sustainable development, European citizenship and the EU's external policy. Other topics that feature in the two communications of 10 February and 14 July 2004 include matching resources to objectives, instruments and good governance, and the financing system.     ACTS     Commission communication of 10 February 2004 "Building our common future - Policy challenges and budgetary means of the enlarged Union 2007-2013" [       COM(2004) 101      final - Not published in the Official Journal]     Commission communication of 14 July 2004 to the Council and the European Parliament "Financial Perspectives 2007 - 2013" [       COM(2004) 487      - Not published in the Official Journal]     SUMMARY     The first Commission communication launches the debate on the objectives and budgetary resources for the European Union for the period 2007-2013. This is the fourth       financial perspective      , following Delors I (1988-1992), Delors II (1993-1999) and       Agenda 2000      (2000-2006), as part of which a new       interinstitutional agreement      was adopted in 1999.     The second communication proposes a set of detailed measures and is accompanied by relevant legislative proposals that are to be negotiated by the Council and the European Parliament. The Commission welcomes the political consensus on the areas of action set out in February's communication, such as employment, sustainable development, security and an effective world role for the EU, and calls for funding the actions in order to realise these goals. At the request of the European Council in June 2004, the Commission has analysed the added value of its proposals and considered that it is demonstrated on the basis of three criteria:      effectiveness: in certain cases, EU action is the only way to get results;       efficiency: the EU offers better value for money;       synergy: EU action stimulates, complements and launches measures.      The document then goes on to develop proposals under each heading.     The number of headings in the financial perspective (i.e. major categories of expenditure) has been reduced from eight to five. This should make the system less rigid and allow resources to be used more efficiently. These headings, for which EUR 1 025 billion will be provided in commitment appropriations between 2007 and 2013, are as follows:      Sustainable development. This is divided into two components:- competitiveness for growth and employment;- cohesion for growth and employment;       Sustainable management and protection of natural resources;       Citizenship, freedom, security and justice;       The European Union as a global partner: this heading covers all external action, including the pre-accession instruments, the incorporation of the European Development Fund (EDF) in the EU budget, and the current reserves earmarked for emergency aid and loan guarantees;       Administration: this covers the expenditure of institutions other than the Commission, pensions and the European Schools. A new feature is that the Commission's administrative expenditure is included directly under the corresponding operational headings and not under this one.      Payment appropriations in the same period will amount to approximately EUR 929 billion.     The Commission also suggests that from 2013 onwards the financial perspective should be established for a period of five years, which would fit in better with the institutional timetable (both the Commission and the Parliament have a five-year term).     The Commission also calls for the       Solidarity Fund      to be integrated into the financial framework (under Heading 3: citizenship, freedom, security and justice).     There is an emphasis on flexibility, to be promoted via three specific mechanisms:     - the procedure for revising expenditure ceilings (which already exists in the current framework);     - a new reallocation flexibility to enable the budgetary authority to reallocate appropriations, within certain limits, between expenditure headings;     - a growth adjustment fund (to be included under the heading for sustainable development) which would make it possible to adjust expenditure more quickly to any changes in the implementation of the roadmap for sustainable development. A sum of EUR 1 billion would be allocated to this fund, which could be supplemented by any funds from the two cohesion instruments that remained unused after two years, up to a maximum of a further EUR 1 billion.      Priorities for the financial framework 2007-2013      In view of the mediocre performance of Europe's economies in recent years, the Commission proposes that the European Union concentrate its efforts on three main priorities:      Promoting sustainable development. This means completing the internal market and mobilising the various policies (economic, social and environmental) to that end. The objectives of competitiveness, cohesion and the protection and management of natural resources also fall under this heading;       Giving meaning to the concept of European citizenship by completing the area of freedom, justice and security and ensuring access to basic public goods and services;       Promoting a coherent role for Europe as a global partner.      On the subject of       sustainable development      , the Commission points out that competitiveness and cohesion are mutually reinforcing. To achieve such development, the European Union must become a dynamic, knowledge-based, growth-oriented economy. There must be greater cohesion, a more competitive agricultural sector, stronger rural development, more sustainable use of fish stocks and environmental protection.     The       competitiveness for growth and employment      component, with a budget of EUR 133 billion, comprises the following objectives:      Promoting the competitiveness of firms within a fully integrated single market, and particularly industrial competitiveness, entrepreneurship, the growth of small businesses, the innovative potential, innovation, investment in information technology for public services, eco-efficient technologies;       Stepping up and improving European research and technological development in order to create a European research area and to achieve the target of bringing public investment in research up to 1% of GDP: Financial aid for independent researchers, partnerships, networking between laboratories and the coordination of programmes and policies are all essential elements. Priority sectors are space and security;       Connecting Europe through EU networks: The cost of congestion is put at 1% of GDP, and improved connections could potentially add 0.23% to GDP. The cost of the whole trans-European network is estimated at EUR 600 billion. A list of 26 priority projects has been drawn up for the period up to 2020, at a cost of EUR 220 billion. Funding will peak in the period 2007-2013;       Improving the standard of education and training, particularly by placing the emphasis on mobility: The aim is for 3 million university students to benefit from this up to 2010, for 150 000 vocational trainees to take part in mobility schemes each year by 2013, for 10% of the school population to be involved in mobility schemes over the course of the programme and for 50 000 adults to take part in lifelong learning schemes;       Achieving the social policy agenda: This agenda, an integral part of the Lisbon strategy, combines legislation, the open method of coordination and social dialogue.      In order to achieve these objectives, the Commission proposes the creation of a single framework programme for competitiveness and innovation in the single market. The areas of research and technological development on the one hand, and sustainable development of the trans-European transport and energy networks on the other, will both be subject to separate instruments. In the field of education and training, a single programme will replace the current ones, with the emphasis on mobility. Other suggestions put forward by the Commission are managing changes with social consequences through the "Progress" programme.      Greater cohesion for growth and employment      , the second component of Heading 1, with a budget of approximately EUR 339 billion between 2007 and 2013, focuses on three priorities:      convergence: efforts must be concentrated on the least-developed Member States and regions;       regional competitiveness and employment: this objective mainly targets the Member States and regions not affected by convergence, given that there will continue to be significant needs;       European territorial cooperation through cross-border and transnational programmes.      The Commission also suggests reinforcing the elements that contribute to the added value of cohesion policy: concentrating resources on investment, complying with the rules on the single market, placing the emphasis on job creation in new areas, contributing to partnership and good governance, and the leverage effect (as a result of co-financing rules that mobilise additional resources for new investment from national public and private resources).     The heading       sustainable management and protection of natural resources      is to receive a total of EUR 405 billion for the period 2007-2013, of which 72% for agriculture (EUR 301 billion). Most of the expenditure for this heading stems from the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), rural development policy after 2006 and from the new common fisheries policy (January 2003) for which the Commission proposes a simplification of the financial arrangements and structures. Environmental matters are also of great importance and the Commission suggests increasing funding in this area and developing an instrument which would allow strictly environmental measures to be taken ("Life+").     In Heading 2,       Conservation and Management of Natural Resources      , the key actions are the common agricultural policy (CAP), rural development policy and fisheries policy. The Commission proposes simplifying the financing arrangements and structures of these policies. The environment is also a key concern and the Commission suggests providing more funding of environmental action and establishing a single instrument to unify strictly environmental measures ("Life+").     The share of the heading       citizenship, freedom, security and justice      in the financial perspective will increase over the years and amount to EUR 25 billion over the period as a whole.     This heading proposes reinforcing the EU as an area of freedom, security and justice through a simplified structure based on three framework programmes ("Freedom of movement and solidarity in the area of external borders, asylum and immigration", "Security" and "Justice and fundamental rights") which would replace all the existing instruments. Management of the funds would be largely shared with the Member States. In the first framework programme, the Commission proposes the creation of an Agency for External Borders and expects Europol, Eurojust and the European Police College to become EU bodies.     This heading also proposes actions and programmes to ensure access to basic goods and services and to foster European culture and diversity, and the creation of a solidarity and rapid reaction instrument.     For the area of freedom, security and justice, the Commission proposes the creation of a European Border Agency and a European Border Guard Corps, a common asylum policy and a common immigration policy. In the interests of security, the priority will be to strengthen Europol and the European Police College. Measures are needed to ensure access to justice and close cooperation between the judicial authorities, as well as common approaches to fighting crime.     Under the heading       the European Union as a global partner      , the emphasis will be placed on the need for the EU to achieve a level of political influence commensurate with its economic influence, so that, in its region and beyond, the EU can be active not only in economic and political areas but also in promoting stability, conflict prevention and crisis management. As a partner in sustainable development, the EU must fight poverty, pursue the millennium development goals set by the United Nations and promote common positions that will give coherence to multilateral negotiations. As a global player, it must work for effective multilateralism and contribute to security in the region. There must also be greater coherence in bilateral relations and international institutions by establishing a single policy framework and unique programming for each partner country and each thematic policy, as well as a common development policy. A total of EUR 95 billion is allocated to this heading.     For this heading, the Commission proposes a drastic simplification of instruments, based on coherence and the importance of the results in relation to the attribution of resources. In the new architecture proposed, three instruments directly support European external policies: the Pre-Accession Policy (IPA), the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument and the Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation Instrument, which will be the main means of cooperation with other non-EU countries not covered by the first two instruments.     With a view to responding to crises and to certain regional or international problems, the Commission proposes three further instruments: the Humanitarian Aid Instrument, the Macro-Financial Assistance (MFA) Instrument and the Instrument for Stability. The Instrument for Stability would also be used to address trans-border challenges such as the fight against terrorism and trafficking, to promote nuclear safety, to provide electoral assistance and to develop the peace-keeping capacity.

The amounts in headings 3 and 4 include expenditure for the Solidarity Fund (EUR 961 million at 2004 prices) and the EDF (estimated as EUR 3 billion) respectively.     (a) Including expenditure for the Solidarity Fund (EUR 961 million at 2004 prices) from 2006. However, the corresponding payments are calculated only from 2007.     (b) The integration of the EDF in the EU budget should take effect in 2008. The commitments for 2006 and 2007 are included for the sake of comparison only. Payments for commitments before 2008 are not taken into account in the payment amounts.     (c) Including the administrative expenditure of institutions other than the Commission, pensions and the European Schools. The Commission's administrative expenditure is included in the first four expenditure headings.     (d) Amounts provided for in the European Union's common position with a view to the Accession Conference with Bulgaria (CONF-BG-27/04).      Matching resources to objectives      The communication also explains the budgetary constraints, and in particular the commitments already entered into which cannot be ignored, such as direct aid to agriculture (fixed until 2013), cohesion policy for the enlarged EU, future enlargement to include Romania and Bulgaria, and the Lisbon and Göteborg strategies. It will be impossible to meet all these commitments if the budgetary resources are less than in the current period. The commitment appropriations ceiling will account for 1.11% of the EU's gross national income (GNI) in 2006. Including the commitments under the 9th EDF would add, on average, another 0.03 % of GNI, but a ceiling of around 1% of GNI would not be sufficient and would require compromises to be made.     The Commission believes that the significance of the challenges identified justifies an increase in the budget but that a credible plan to meet the Union's needs can be drawn up within an overall own resources ceiling of 1.24% of GNI.     Financial transfers will continue to be capped at 4% of GNI of the State concerned for cohesion policy, and the amounts transferred to the new rural development and fisheries instruments are still included in the calculation.      Instruments and governance      The success of policies relies on the efficiency of delivery instruments. The Commission accordingly reiterates the guiding principles of the proper apportionment of tasks: concentration of resources, consistency between goals, and partnership with all the actors involved.     A crucial feature of the communication is the simplification of instruments by means of a roadmap that brings together goals, objectives, instruments, indicators and a stringent timetable. Simplification will take account of consistency, the political dimension of the project and the principle of proportionality. The Commission thus proposes applying a single instrument per policy area (a single fund per programme) and examining alternatives to in-house direct management. Annex 1 to the document contains an overall approach to administrative governance.      The financing system      The structure of own resources and the correction of budgetary imbalances are dealt with in this section.     As regards the system of own resources, the Commission acknowledges the criticism about its complexity and lack of transparency, but stresses its successful performance in financial terms, given that the system has achieved its primary aim of ensuring the stability of resources. In its view, a visible tax resource payable by EU citizens and/or economic operators could partly replace the GNI contributions. It sets out three possibilities for the future, even though the Commission was not supposed to propose a new own resource as part of the financial perspective for 2007-2013:      a tax on corporate income;       a genuine VAT resource;       an energy tax.      The Commission also makes it clear that the tax burden for citizens would not increase.     To correct budgetary imbalances, the Commission suggests a generalised correction mechanism to correct net contributions in excess of a certain pre-defined threshold of adequate "financial solidarity", defined as a percentage of gross national income, in line with the relative prosperity of the Member States.     RELATED ACTS      Commission working document of 14 July 2004, "Proposal for renewal of the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure" [         COM(2004) 498        final - Not published in the Official Journal]      This working document is intended to serve as a basis for the negotiations between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission aimed at drawing up common rules for the management of the multiannual financial framework and the annual budgetary procedure. It proposes that the existing basic principles of budgetary discipline be retained, in particular the structure of the financial framework divided into broad categories of expenditure ("headings"), the definition of maximum amounts ("ceilings") for commitment appropriations in each heading and the setting of an annual ceiling on payment appropriations.     Drawing on the experience acquired with previous financial frameworks, the Commission is also suggesting adjustments regarding flexibility, transparency and interinstitutional collaboration, e.g. the integration into the financial framework of the European Development Fund and the Solidarity and Rapid Reaction Fund, two instruments which, although managed at European Union level, currently fall outside Agenda 2000.

   Strategy for sustainable development     Strategy for sustainable development     The European Union has formulated a long-term strategy to dovetail the policies for economically, socially and environmentally sustainable development, its goal being sustainable improvement of the well-being and standard of living of current and future generations.     ACT     Commission Communication of 15 May 2001 ‘A Sustainable Europe for a Better World: A European Union Strategy for Sustainable Development’ (Commission proposal to the Gothenburg European Council) [       COM(2001) 264      final – not published in the Official Journal].     Commission Communication of 13 December 2005 on the review of the Sustainable Development Strategy – A platform for action [       COM(2005) 658      final – not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This strategy provides an EU-wide policy framework to deliver sustainable development, i.e. to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.     It rests on four separate pillars – economic, social, environmental and global governance – which need to reinforce one another. The economic, social and environmental consequences of all policies thus need to be examined in a coordinated manner and taken into account when those policies are being drawn up and adopted. The EU also needs to assume its international responsibilities with regard to sustainable development, whose various aspects – including democracy, peace, security and liberty – need to be promoted beyond EU borders.     This strategy, which complements the Lisbon Strategy, shall be a catalyst for policy makers and public opinion, to change society’s behaviour. It is built around measures covering the main challenges identified, as well as cross-cutting measures, adequate funding, the involvement of all stakeholders and effective policy implementation and follow-up.     The strategy is based on the following guiding principles: promotion and protection of fundamental rights, solidarity within and between generations, the guarantee of an open and democratic society, involvement of citizens, involvement of businesses and social partners, policy coherence and governance, policy integration, use of best available knowledge, the precautionary principle and the polluter-pays principle.      Measures for responding to the key challenges      The strategy identifies seven unsustainable trends on which action needs to be taken. This strategy lists a whole range of operational and numerical targets and specific measures at EU level to attain these objectives. These measures were updated and developed in the 2005 strategy review.     The first long-term specific objective of the strategy is to limit       climate change      and its effects by meeting commitments under the       Kyoto Protocol      and under the framework of the       European Strategy on Climate Change      . Energy efficiency, renewable energy and transport will be the subject of particular efforts.     Limiting the adverse effects of       transport      and reducing regional disparities is another long-term objective, for which there is a need to break the link between economic growth and transport growth and do more to develop transport that is environmentally friendly and conducive to health. The strategy envisages, among other measures, infrastructure charging, promotion of alternatives to road transport and vehicles which produce less pollution and use less energy.     To promote more sustainable       modes of production and consumption      the link between economic growth and environmental degradation needs to be broken and attention paid to how much ecosystems can tolerate. With this aim in view, the EU must among other things promote green public procurement, define environmental and social performance targets for products in cooperation with stakeholders, expand the distribution of environmental innovations and environmental technologies and produce information about and appropriate labelling of products and services.      Sustainable management of natural resources      is also an objective. From now until 2010 overexploitation needs to be avoided, efficiency of natural resource use improved, the value of ecosystem services recognised and loss of biodiversity halted. In particular the EU must make efforts in agriculture, fisheries and forest management; see to it that the Natura 2000 network is completed; define and implement priority actions to protect biodiversity, and make sure that aspects associated with the seas and oceans are duly taken into account. Recycling and re-use must also be supported.     Limiting major threats to       public health      is another of the strategy’s objectives. Food safety and quality must be ensured throughout the food chain. Threats to health and the environment posed by chemicals must be removed by 2020 and research into the links between health and pollutants must be developed. Issues relating to epidemics, resistance to antibiotics and lifestyle must be tackled, in particular to prepare for a possible pandemic and combat HIV/AIDS.     In order to combat       social exclusion and poverty      and mitigate the effects of an ageing society, the EU must promote active ageing and make efforts to ensure the viability of pension and social protection systems, integrate legal migrants and develop a Community immigration policy, improve the situation of families – especially of children – and promote equality between men and women.     The revised strategy also provides for strengthening       the fight against global poverty      , monitoring global sustainable development and compliance with international commitments. To achieve this, the EU must in particular increase the amount of aid provided to less favoured countries, improve the coherence and quality of development aid policies and promote better international governance.      Intersectoral measures      The       Knowledge Society      must be the driving force behind sustainable development. Special efforts need to be made in education and training for the greatest number of participants, so as to bring about a change in behaviour and give the public the necessary skills to meet the objectives laid down in the strategy. Scientific and technical innovation also needs to be stimulated, especially through framework programmes of research and development and in association with universities, research institutes, businesses and government officials.      Financial and economic instruments      are another way to engender a market that offers less polluting products and services and to change consumer behaviour. Prices therefore need to reflect actual environmental and social costs, whereas fiscal measures should be applied to energy and resource consumption and/or pollution. In addition, financial support from European funds must be coordinated between the Commission and Member States to optimise efficiency.     Better       communication      will help involve businesses and the public. Stress is laid on the importance of systematic dialogue with consumers and of consulting other countries in order to mobilise the efforts of all parties. The different parties, including public administrations (European and national), businesses and the public (including non-governmental organisations) must establish partnerships among themselves.      Formulation of policies and review of progress      Member States must draw up national strategies and regularly review progress accomplished. They must carry out impact assessments before adopting their policies or committing public funds.     All the instruments available to the public authorities must be used to contribute to sustainable development. This includes regulations, but also incentives or market based instruments.     The Commission evaluates the implementation of the strategy once every two years on the basis of       sustainable development indicators      that it has adopted and, where necessary, updated. This evaluation forms the basis of another, carried out once every two years by the December European Council. Other bodies and institutions also examine what has been achieved and establish links with Member States and the public if required. The strategy provides for a review of its objectives by Council decision no later than 2011.      Background      The main lines of the strategy that the Commission proposed in 2001 were set out in the conclusions of the       Gothenburg European Council      of June 2001. It also formed part of the European Union’s preparatory work for the 2002 world summit on sustainable development (Rio + 10) held in Johannesburg. Before that summit the Commission presented another communication on how the Union should contribute towards sustainable development in the world; elements of that communication were incorporated into the strategy when it was reviewed.     A public consultation on the sustainable development strategy was organised following the appointment of the new Commission in 2004. The Commission also drew up a communication taking an overall look at the progress made thanks to the sustainable development strategy, referring to the main findings of the consultation and setting out broad orientations for review of the strategy.     For its part, the Brussels European Council of June 2005 reaffirmed both the key objectives of sustainable development and the guiding principles which need to underpin the renewed strategy.     In December 2005, the Commission adopted a communication in which it:      determines the main areas which require a fresh impetus in the years to come. It points out that these areas are interdependent and require responses based on cooperation and solidarity, on research and innovation and on the education of the population;       proposes to take more account of the impact of European policies on sustainable development at world level;       proposes methods to measure the progress achieved and regularly review priorities at national and Community levels;       recommends a permanent dialogue with the individuals and organisations – company heads, regional and local authorities, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), etc. – involved in sustainable development.      This communication underpinned the adoption of a new EU Sustainable Development Strategy at the       Brussels European Council      of June 2006.     RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 24 July 2009 - Mainstreaming sustainable development into EU policies : 2009 Review of the European Union Strategy for Sustainable Development [         COM(2009) 400        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      This Review reports on the policy developments carried out at European level following the adoption of the European Union Strategy for Sustainable Development. In this regard, the European Union plays an important role in the fight against climate change and in promoting a low-carbon economy.     However, progress in sustainable development still needs to be made and the Review opens a discussion on how the strategy can be improved. It should be better coordinated with other European policy strategies, particularly with the Lisbon Strategy on Growth and Jobs. The implementation of the strategy should be streamlined in order to improve its management and its actual results.      Commission Communication of 22 October 2007 ‘Progress Report on the Sustainable Development Strategy 2007’ [         COM(2007) 642        final – not published in the Official Journal].      In this report the Commission considers that progress achieved on the ground has been modest, but great advances in EU and Member State policy development have occurred in many areas, in particular climate change, clean energy and health.      Commission Communication of 9 February 2005 ‘The 2005 Review of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy: Initial Stocktaking and Future Orientations’ [         COM(2005) 37        final – not published in the Official Journal].      The Commission takes stock of progress since 2001, even though immediate results cannot be expected. The Commission also sets out the future orientations which should guide the review of the strategy, specifically:      reaffirming the new approach to policy making and policy coherence (impact assessment, stakeholder consultation, regulatory simplification, market-based instruments);       pursuing action on key unsustainable trends (assessment of these trends and the linkages between them);       setting new priority objectives and targets, together with intermediate milestones to measure progress;       reinforcing the monitoring of the strategy;       strengthening ownership of the strategy (awareness-raising and mobilisation) and improving cooperation with public and private actors.       Sustainable development indicators to monitor the implementation of the EU sustainable development strategy [SEC(2005) 161 - not published in the Official Journal].      The Commission presents a list of indicators for monitoring the implementation of the political priorities which were agreed at the Gothenburg and Barcelona European Councils or which relate to the commitments entered into by the European Union at the Johannesburg world summit on sustainable development. The list takes the form of a hierarchical framework of 12 headline indicators (corresponding to the main sustainable development themes identified at European and international level), 45 core policy indicators (corresponding to the key objectives of each theme) and 98 analytical indicators (corresponding to measures implementing the key objectives).

summary of   Decision (EU) 2016/920 on the signing of the Agreement between the US and the EU on the protection of personal information relating to the prevention, investigation, detection, and prosecution of criminal offences    EU-US agreement on standards of protection when personal data are transferred between EU-US law enforcement authorities   what is the aim of the decision and the agreement   The decision authorised the signature (on 2 June 2016) of the agreement between the United States of America (US) and the European Union (EU) on the protection of personal information relating to the prevention, investigation, detection, and prosecution of criminal offences (the so-called ‘Umbrella Agreement’). The agreement will enter into force only after the parties have notified each other that their respective internal procedures for entry into force have been completed (which, on the EU side, requires that the Council adopts a decision to conclude the agreement following consent by the European Parliament).   The agreement aims to ensure that personal data is protected to a high standard when being transferred by law enforcement authorities (police and criminal justice authorities). It also aims to foster law enforcement cooperation between the EU and the EU countries, on the one hand, and the US on the other.   It provides greater legal certainty and strengthens the rights of the individuals concerned by the transfer of their data.   The agreement is 1 of 3 key actions set out in a  2016 Communication  designed to restore trust in data flows between the EU and the US.   key points    Scope    The agreement  complements  rules regarding personal data protection in existing EU/EU country-US agreements, and in national laws, that authorise the exchange of information for law enforcement purposes. It establishes a common data protection framework which will also apply to future agreements and national laws in this field.

   European system for registration of carriers of radioactive materials (Proposal)     European system for registration of carriers of radioactive materials (Proposal)     This Proposal for a Regulation aims at replacing national reporting and authorisation procedures relating to carriers of radioactive materials by a unique registration system. The implementation of the Regulation should enable procedures to be simplified and administrative burden to be reduced, whilst maintaining a high level of radiation protection.     PROPOSAL     Proposal for a Council Regulation of 30 August 2011 establishing a Community system for registration of carriers of radioactive materials [       COM(2011) 518      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This Proposal for a Regulation aims at putting in place a European system for registration of carriers of radioactive materials       *      . Workers and the general public must be protected against the       dangers arising from ionising radiation      .     The Proposal concerns any carrier transporting radioactive materials within the European Union (EU), from third countries into the EU and from the EU into third countries. It does not concern carriers transporting radioactive materials by air or sea.      Registration of carriers      Carriers must register with the       Electronic System for Carrier Registration      (ESCReg). The system offers restricted and secure access to the competent authorities of the Member States, to the registered carriers and to the applicants, in accordance with the provisions of the       Data Protection Directive      .     If an applicant is established in one or more Member States, its application is processed by the competent authority       *      of the Member State where its head office is located. If the applicant is established in a third country, its application is processed by the competent authority of the Member State where the carrier intends to first enter EU territory.     Member States shall designate a competent authority and a national contact point for the transport of radioactive materials.     If the competent authority refuses to grant the carrier a certificate of registration, the applicant may lodge an appeal.     The certificate of registration is recognised by all Member States and is valid for a period of five years. It may be renewed.      Conditions of transport for radioactive materials      Once registered, the carrier is authorised to carry out transport operations throughout the EU. Carriers must have a copy of their registration certificate during such transport operations.     National reporting and authorisation requirements in addition to those of this Proposal for a Regulation may only apply for the following materials:      fissile materials;       high consequence radioactive materials.      However, holders of a licence or registration issued pursuant to the       Directive on the dangers arising from ionising radiation      may transport radioactive materials without registration if their transport is included in licences or registrations for all Member States where the transport takes place.     If carriers do not comply with the requirements of this Proposal for a Regulation, the authorities of the Member State where the offence is recorded may suspend, revoke or modify the carrier’s registration. The carrier may also be prosecuted.      Context      In 2008, the Council and the Parliament adopted the       Directive on the transport of dangerous goods      grouping together all modes of inland transport. Pursuant to Directive 96/29/Euratom, which lays down basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against       dangers arising from ionising radiation      , Member States must put in place a system for the registration of companies and institutions processing radioactive materials, including carriers. Under this Proposal for a Regulation, registration will be centralised in order to facilitate transport within the EU.       Key terms of the Act         Radioactive material: any material containing radionuclides where both the activity concentration and the total activity in the consignment exceed the values specified in the           Regulation on shipments of radioactive substances          Competent authority: any authority designated by the Member State to carry out tasks in accordance with this Regulation.

   Interim report on the single market in the 21st century     Interim report on the single market in the 21st century     The preliminary report to the 2007 Spring European Council looks at the single market and presents the European Commission's vision of it for the 21st century. It describes an initial set of guidelines, with the aim of initiating a full review of the single market as well as stimulating additional proposals for action.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions issued 21 February 2007 - "A single market for citizens - interim report to the 2007 Spring European Council" [       COM (2007) 60      final - not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This interim report presents a vision of the 21st century single market. The single market represents one of the greatest and most tangible successes of the European Union (EU). It enables Europe to benefit from a more dynamic and competitive economy, where social rights are guaranteed alongside high standards of health, safety and the environment.     The single market makes consumers and businesses equal winners:       Consumers        benefit from a wider choice of products and services at lower prices and with higher levels of quality/safety;        Businesses        operate within a common set of rules and benefit from a market which has 500 million consumers.      Nevertheless, the reality of the single market is constantly developing: it will never be "finalised", nor will it be "complete". On the contrary, it is necessary to confront the new types of barriers and challenges (globalisation, structural developments, EU expansion, etc.) that emerge as markets develop. To do this, the single market of the 21st century is expected to make markets work better and deliver even greater tangible benefits to European citizens in an enlarged European Union.      A vision for the 21st century      The real challenge for the single market in the 21st century is to adapt the application of the existing regulatory framework and to respond appropriately to the dynamism of the world economy. The document identifies six key aspects:       a single market for consumers and citizens        Benefits for consumers need to be even more tangible, within a framework of significant enhanced protection and quality for European products and services as well as for imports;        a single market for an integrated economy        A single integrated market is essential to ensure fair and effective competition among businesses. A greater role for SMEs, creation of a European labour market, the spread of the use of the euro, more significant pan-European financial markets and investment in trans-European networks contribute to the further integration of the European economy;        a single market for a knowledge society        Markets for highly knowledge- and technology-intensive goods and services need to be supported by confronting their fragmentation;        a single market for a well regulated Europe        Now is the time to examine how all rules applicable throughout the whole Community are implemented, check if they are having the desired effects and, if necessary, make the required changes;        a single market for a sustainable Europe        It is vital to both recognise and support the social and environmental aspects of the single market, by anticipating and supporting the process of globalisation;        a single market open to the world        Europe must continue to act as a global standard-setter in the commercial and investment sectors.       Making the vision a reality      In order to make the vision of the single market a reality, the EU will make more efficient and consistent use of a range of instruments from various policy domains (domestic market, competition, tax and customs, etc.), reducing unnecessary administration costs.     The EU will need to adopt new approaches, which will benefit from a greater evaluation of the requirements of those within the single market and of the social impact of further integration.     Given the increased diversity in a Union of 27 Member States, it will be advisable to use a range of diverse and flexible instruments (harmonisation - mutual recognition, directives - regulations), with greater reliance on networks and by enhancing the ownership of the single market in the Member States.     The opportunities of the single market need to be better communicated and more accessible to citizens, businesses and local and regional authorities. Furthermore, priorities for the single market need to be linked to the global agenda, including the recent round of bilateral trade negotiations.     The EU will have recourse to the neighbourhood policy; it will reinforce benchmarking and bilateral cooperation on rules and will ensure that consumers benefit properly from the openness to global markets.     The annex to the Communication contains actual examples of what the single market has accomplished.      Background      This interim report aims to present the guidelines for an in-depth review and a new vision for the single market of the future. It is based on the findings of a public consultation, "Eurobarometer" polls and a public hearing as well as on input from other EU institutions. A full review of the single market, based on various studies and analyses, will be completed before the end of 2007.

act   Green Paper on the insurance of natural and man-made disasters [  COM(2013) 213  final of 16.4.2013 - not published in the Official Journal].   summary   Between 1980 and 2011, Europe suffered up to  €445 billion in financial losses  due to various disasters, such as river and flash floods, storm surges, forest fires and earthquakes, proving that the European Union (EU) is  vulnerable  to almost all types of natural disaster.  Given that such disasters  may occur more frequently in the future  , in 2013, the European Commission issued a Green Paper with a view to starting a debate on the subject. This document reviews the current system of disaster insurance, and asks whether it is sufficiently resourced, whether it needs to be improved and whether the EU should take action in this regard.   Insurance: A risk management tool.   The Green Paper seeks to  increase the knowledge of those working in the insurance sector  as to the merits of disaster insurance. It highlights how a  culture of precaution and knowledge about risk management  needs to develop.  Research currently shows that there is a  very small market for disaster insurance  in EU countries and that people and businesses often underestimate the real cost of insurance.  This matter is of particular concern for the EU as disasters can have major cross-border effects potentially threatening areas of neighbouring countries.  Even where costs of major disasters are concentrated in one area or one country, if they are inadequately covered by insurance, then the state affected carries large costs and burdens.   Establishing a market for disaster insurance   The paper sets out a number of methods that could be used in setting up a disaster insurance market. These include the following.   A  bundling together  of several types of unrelated scenarios into a single insurance policy, e.g., fire and storm or fire and flood. Therefore, as each risk is independent of the other in the policy bundling, it would reduce the accumulated risks on any one hazard in the policy.   The introduction of  compulsory disaster insurance  which would overcome problems of people not adequately insuring their assets because they underestimate the risk involved. There is also the issue of people who believe themselves at risk paying huge premiums as there is not a sufficiently large pool of customers, hence the high price.   To help reduce the pressure on Member States’ governments, the EU also suggests that  governments  consider becoming involved as  insurers or initiating state-run insurance pools  . The setting up of disaster insurance pools, which would allow the insurance market to extend its capacity to absorb more risk.   Lastly, the Green Paper also points out how  insurers  could provide incentives to promote risk awareness and prevention so as to encourage people to insure their assets and reduce their vulnerability. These include  discounts  to people who take the initiative in insuring their assets against certain events, which, in turn, could lead to  increased uptake  of such policies.
   Cooperation with industrialised countries (2001-2006)     Cooperation with industrialised countries (2001-2006)     The European Community pursues cooperation and trade relations with the industrialised countries       *      of North America, the Far East and Australasia.     ACT     Council Regulation (EC) No       382/2001      of 26 February 2001 concerning the implementation of projects promoting cooperation and commercial relations between the European Union and the industrialised countries of North America, the Far East and Australasia and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1035/1999 [       See amending acts      ].     Repealed by Council Regulation (EC) No       1934/2006      of 21 December 2006 establishing a financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high-income countries and territories [Official Journal L 405 of 30.12.2006].     SUMMARY     On the basis of Articles 133 and 308 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Community implements actions to promote cooperation and trade with the industrialised countries of North America, the Far East and Australasia.     This regulation provides a legal framework for engaging in such cooperative actions. It also comes under the bilateral relations already established with:       The United States of America        : these relations are based on the         1990 Transatlantic Declaration        , the         1995 New Transatlantic Agenda        , the         1998 Transatlantic Economic Partnership        and the 1999 Bonn Declaration;        Canada        : these relations are based on the 1976 Framework Agreement for commercial and economic cooperation, the 1990 Declaration on EC-Canada Relations, the 1996 Joint Action Plan and Joint Political Declaration, and the Ottawa Summit partnership agenda adopted on 18 March 2004;        Japan        : these relations are based on the 1991 Joint Declaration and the 2001 EU-Japan Action Plan;        The Republic of Korea        : these relations are based on the Framework Agreement on trade and cooperation, which entered into force in 2001;        Australia        : these relations are based on the 1997 Joint Declaration, revised in 2003;        New Zealand        : these relations are based on the 1999 Joint Declaration, revised in 2004.      This regulation aims to promote cooperation under the various bilateral instruments between the EU and the partner countries by creating a more favourable climate for the conduct and further development of these relations.     Financing will cover in particular the following activities:      education and information of the public about the bilateral relations;       strengthening cultural, academic and people-to-people links;       promotion of the dialogue between political, economic and social partners;       research work and studies destined to provide input to the Commission's work;       cooperative projects in science and technology, energy, transport and environmental matters;       enhancing customs cooperation;       enhancing the visibility of the EU in the partner countries;       pilot schemes, which could subsequently lead to new activities to be financed.      The financing of cooperation projects will be provided entirely from the Community budget or will take the form of cofinancing with other sources in the partner countries and/or the EU.     Some projects directly concern individuals, in the fields of education and training for instance. Grants and study awards may be paid to natural persons in such cases.     With Japan, and to a lesser extent Korea, the Community will implement a specific programme of measures and actions to improve the Member States' commercial presence on the Japanese and Korean markets. The regulation provides for support for various actions, namely:      the participation of European commercial executives in actions carried out in Japan and in Korea (         executive training programmes involving Japan and Korea        );       the collection of information and policy advice on trade-related issues with Japan;       conferences and seminars to promote trade and investment;       recruitment, training, preparation of missions to facilitate access to the Japanese market by Community companies (Gateway to Japan).      The Commission will be assisted by a committee in implementing actions in the trade field.     The Commission will submit a bi-annual report on the implementation of the regulation to Parliament and the Council. The Commission will also evaluate the actions and programmes concerned in order to determine whether they have achieved their objectives.     The regulation will expire on 31 December 2007. It has been extended pending a new legal framework.       Key terms used in the act         Industrialised countries: the United States, Canada, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Australia, New Zealand.

   European Union missions in Bosnia-Herzegovina     European Union missions in Bosnia-Herzegovina     The European Union is leading a police mission and military operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina under the framework of the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) and is thus contributing to the implementation of the peace process in this country and the stabilisation of the Balkans.     ACTS     Council Joint Action       2002/210/CFSP      of 11 March 2002 on the European Union Police Mission [       See modifying acts      ].     Council Joint Action       2004/570/CFSP      of 12 July 2004 on the European Union military operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina [       See modifying acts      ].     SUMMARY     The European Union is leading two missions in Bosnia-Herzegovina, a police mission called "EUPM" and a military operation called "EUFOR ALTHEA".      European Union Police Mission (EUPM)      The aim of the European Union police mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina is to establish sustainable policing arrangements in this country under Bosnian ownership and in accordance with best European and international practice in this area. The Mission will lead monitoring, mentoring and inspection actions in order to ensure that police officers act in a professional, independent and impartial manner in accordance with legislation and agreements made under the Stabilisation and Association Process with the European Union.     The Mission will also ensure that police services are based on a transparent structure that takes into consideration the multiple ethnic composition of Bosnian society and that all the police forces in the country cooperate with each other. Furthermore, the Mission will ensure that police carry out investigations of corruption and that they are capable of working on all types of criminal activity, including organised crime and terrorism.     The EUPM consists of 192 international members and 220 local members (October 2008). The main headquarters are located in Sarajevo and monitoring units are deployed in the same location as various Bosnia and Herzegovina police structures at medium and high levels. The 27 European Union Member States contribute to the Mission alongside Canada, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and Ukraine.      EUFOR ALTHEA      The aim of the European Union military operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is to provide deterrence, to contribute to a safe and secure environment and to ensure compliance with Annexes 1.A and 2 of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, relating to military matters and internal borders.     EUFOR ALTHEA comprises around 2200 military personnel from 24 Member States, Albania, Chile, Macedonia, Switzerland and Turkey. The operation includes a multinational battalion and an integrated police unit based in Sarajevo, monitoring and liaison teams spread out across the whole country and five regional coordination centres in Sarajevo Tuzla, Banja Luka, Mostar and Zenica.      Context      On 1 January 2003 the EUPM took over from the United Nations International Police Task Force (IPTF) in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the deployment of which was provided for in the General Agreement Framework for Peace (or the Dayton Peace Agreement) signed in 1995. This was the very first mission organised under the framework of the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP).     EUFOR ALTHEA succeeded the NATO stabilisation force (SFOR) on 2 December 2004.

   European Youth Pact     European Youth Pact     This Communication shows how the Member States can put into operation the European Youth Pact, which was adopted by the European Council in March 2005, tying in with the European strategies for employment and social inclusion and the "Education and Training 2010" work programme. The main aim is to improve the education, training, mobility, vocational integration and social inclusion of young Europeans, while facilitating the reconciliation of family and working life. The Commission is also seeking to achieve consistency of initiatives in these different areas, and wants the Member States to consult young people in connection with developing and following up these initiatives.     ACT     Commission Communication of 30 May 2005 on European policies concerning youth: Addressing the concerns of young people in Europe - implementing the European Youth Pact and promoting active citizenship [       COM(2005) 206      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The Communication draws attention to the three strands of the Pact adopted by the European Council in March 2005:      employment, integration and social advancement;       education, training and mobility;       reconciliation of family life and working life.      The measures to be taken in these three areas will have to be fully incorporated into the       revised Lisbon Strategy      , the       European Employment Strategy      , the       Social Inclusion Strategy      and the "       Education and Training 2010      " work programme.     For the purpose of implementing the different measures, the Member States will draw on the "integrated guidelines for growth and employment", within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy.     The Commission's text highlights the aspects of the integrated guidelines and the Community Lisbon programme that are relevant to the Pact.      Measures for the employment, integration and social advancement of young people      The following guidelines have the most relevance for young people:      promotion of a life-cycle approach to work (entailing,         inter alia        , renewed efforts to build employment pathways for young people and to reduce youth unemployment, in tandem with resolute action to eliminate gender gaps in employment, unemployment and pay);       creation of inclusive labour markets for job-seekers and disadvantaged people;       improvement in the matching of labour market needs;       expansion of investment in human capital;       adjustment of education and training systems in response to new skills requirements.      The Member States will receive financial assistance from the European Social Fund and the European Investment Bank for implementing the necessary measures. The Commission wants the Member States to devise tailor-made action plans providing job search assistance, guidance services and training. The Communication also proposes that:      the Commission and the Member States give priority to young people in the mutual learning programme on employment in 2005;       the Commission and the Member States, through the Social Inclusion Strategy, improve the situation of the most vulnerable young people;       the Commission launch a study on the social integration of highly disadvantaged young people in 2005.       Measures for education, training and mobility      The priorities are:      reducing the number of early school leavers;       widening access to vocational, secondary and higher education, including apprenticeships and entrepreneurship training;       defining common frameworks to make qualification systems more transparent;       tackling the validation of non-formal and informal learning;       implementing the         Europass        decision;       developing a "Youthpass".      The Commission intends, during 2005 and 2006, to:      adopt a Communication on entrepreneurship education;       propose a European Qualifications Framework;       adopt a Recommendation on key competences.      The Communication looks at ways of enhancing young people's mobility, highlighting a number of initiatives:      in 2006, the European Year of Worker Mobility, specific initiatives will be taken for the benefit of young people entering the job market;       from 2007, there will be follow-up to the 2002-05         action plan of the Commission and the Member States for skills and mobility        ;       the Member States will be asked to boost implementation of the         Recommendation on the mobility of students        , persons undergoing training, volunteers, teachers and trainers;       the Commission will adapt tools such as         EURES        and         PLOTEUS        with a view to enhancing the opportunities for young people to work and study abroad;       the Commission will, in 2005, make recommendations on a mobility card for young people in Europe;       the Commission will think about extending the "Working holidays" initiative;       the Commission and the Member States will, in 2007, implement new forms of         European Voluntary Service        .       Measures for reconciling family life and working life      The Communication makes it clear that a better balance is needed between work and family life in order to tackle the problems associated with demographic ageing and a low birth rate. With a view to better reconciling family and working life, the Commission will encourage:      the Member States to make provision for quality accessible and affordable childcare facilities and care for other dependants;       the Member States, assisted by the Commission, to develop new forms of work organisation, such as flexitime, tele-working, maternity and parental leave.      Following on from the Green Paper on Europe's changing demographics, the Commission has launched a process of consultation with the aim of identifying policies to be pursued or reinforced at European and national levels.      THE ACTIVE CITIZENSHIP OF YOUNG PEOPLE      The citizenship of young people is a focal point of the open method of coordination. With a view to improving       participation, information      ,       voluntary activities      and       knowledge of youth issues      , the Council adopted 14 common objectives in 2003 and 2004. In its Communication of October 2004 [       COM(2004) 694      final], the Commission gave a positive evaluation of the activities conducted at European level, while stressing the need for suitable measures at national level to consolidate the common objectives.     The Pact and associated actions ought to give rise to better understanding and greater knowledge of youth in the areas concerned, namely:      employment;       integration and inclusion;       entrepreneurship;       mobility;       recognition of youth work.       THE YOUTH DIMENSION IN OTHER POLICIES      The Communication draws attention to other policies which are relevant to young people:      since 2005, the European campaign "For Diversity - Against Discrimination" has been extended to young people;       a European initiative for the health of children and young people is planned for 2006;       studies focusing specifically on youth will be undertaken as part of the Sixth Research Framework Programme;       the Seventh Research Framework Programme will include youth-related research, which could focus on the impact of young people's participation in representative democracy and voluntary activities;       the Commission will launch, in 2005, a public consultation on sport.       SUPPORT PROGRAMME      Policy actions targeting young people should be accompanied by programmes supporting projects that encourage young people to become active citizens. Various European programmes support such projects:       European Social Fund        ;        European Regional Development Fund        ;        Rural Development Fund        ;       "         Youth        " and "Youth in Action";       Integrated Lifelong Learning Programme;       "         Citizens for Europe        ";        Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme        ;        Marie Curie Programme        ;       European Science Education Initiative.       INVOLVEMENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE      As far as the Pact itself is concerned, the European Council has emphasised the need to consult young people and their organisations both on the development of national reform programmes for the Lisbon Strategy and on follow-up action. National youth councils should, in any event, be among those consulted.     The Commission also intends to consult young people and the European Youth Forum on youth policy. This consultation process will culminate in the holding of a Youth Assembly in 2005. In addition, the Commission hopes that this assembly will be a precursor of "annual encounters" between young people and Commissioners.      BACKGROUND      This Communication builds on the European Youth Pact adopted by the Heads of State or Government during the European Council of March 2005.     Adoption of the Pact coincides with the completion of the first cycle of implementing the White Paper on a new impetus for European youth, published in 2001.     RELATED ACTS      Resolution of the Council of 24 November 2005 on addressing the concerns of young people in Europe -- implementing the European Pact for Youth and promoting active citizenship[Official Journal C 292/5 of 24.11.2005]      The Council invites the Member States to develop structured dialogue with young people and their organisations at national, regional and local level on policy actions affecting them, with the involvement of researchers in the youth field. It calls on the Member States and the Commission to:      encourage the recognition of non-formal and informal learning, for example through developing a "Youthpass" and considering its inclusion in Europass, and consider the validation of such learning;       identify obstacles to and exchange, develop and apply good practice concerning young people's mobility in order to make it easier for them to work, volunteer, train and study throughout the European Union and further afield;       evaluate the framework for European cooperation in the youth field in 2009.       Conclusions of the Council Presidency at the end of the European Council meeting on 22 and 23 March 2005      The European Council called on the Member states, within the framework of the European Employment Strategy and the Social Inclusion Strategy, to improve the education, training, mobility, vocational integration and social inclusion of young people, while facilitating the reconciliation of working life and family life.     The Pact should ensure the overall consistency of initiatives to be taken in these different areas. Its success depends on the involvement of all parties concerned, first and foremost youth organisations.     Last updated: 28.09.2006  
   Information management in the area of freedom, security and justice     Information management in the area of freedom, security and justice     This communication provides a transparent presentation of European instruments used to manage personal information for the purposes of law enforcement or migration management. It describes what information is collected, stored or exchanged about citizens, for what purposes and by whom.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council of 20 July 2010 – Overview of information management in the area of freedom, security and justice [       COM(2010) 385      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The communication presents an overview of European Union (EU) level instruments that regulate the collection, storage or cross-border exchange of personal data for law enforcement or migration management purposes. It describes the main purpose and structure of these instruments, as well as the types of personal data they cover, the authorities that have access to these data and the rules for data protection and retention. It also sets out the main principles to take into consideration when designing and evaluating such instruments in future.      Instruments in force, under implementation or consideration      The current EU level instruments consist of those that aim to improve the functioning of the       Schengen area      and the customs union, such as the:      Schengen Information System (SIS) and the         second generation Schengen Information System        (SIS II), which is currently under development;        Eurodac system        ;        Visa Information System        (VIS);       directive on the         transmission of Advance Passenger Information        (API);        Naples II Convention        ;        Customs Information System        (CIS) and its Customs File Identification Database (FIDE).      There are also EU level instruments aimed at preventing and combating terrorism and other forms of serious cross-border crime, such as the:      framework decision on         simplifying the exchange of information between law enforcement authorities        ;       decision on         stepping up cross-border cooperation        ;       Data Retention Directive         2006/24/EC        ;       framework decisions on         taking account of previous convictions in new criminal proceedings        and on         exchanging information from criminal records        , including the European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS) for the latter;       Council Decision         2000/642/JHA        on exchanging information between EU countries’ Financial Intelligence Units;       decision on         cooperation between Asset Recovery Offices        (AROs);       Cybercrime Alert Platforms.      In addition, EU agencies and bodies have been established to assist EU countries in preventing and combating serious cross-border crime, such as the       European Police Office      (Europol) and the       EU’s Judicial Cooperation Unit      (Eurojust).     As to cooperation with non-EU countries to prevent and combat terrorism and other forms of serious transnational crime, the Commission has signed Passenger Name Record (PNR) agreements with the       United States      , Australia and Canada. However, the European Parliament is critical of the content of these agreements and has, therefore, requested the Commission to renegotiate them. The Commission has also signed an       agreement with the United States on the transfer of financial messaging data      (EU-US TFTO Agreement).      Instruments envisaged in the Stockholm Programme action plan      In its       action plan on the Stockholm Programme      , the Commission has committed to presenting in the course of 2011 three legislative proposals:      a PNR package;       an Entry/Exit System (EES) for non-EU country nationals entering the Union for stays of a maximum of three months;       a Registered Travellers Programme (RTP) for simplifying border checks for certain groups of frequent travellers from non-EU countries.      The Stockholm Programme action plan also includes initiatives that the Commission is to study, with a view to presenting a communication on their feasibility:      an EU Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme (EU TFTP), for facilitating data transfers from the EU to the United States;       an Electronic System of Travel Authorisations (ESTA), for facilitating the entry of non-EU nationals who are not subject to visa requirements;       a European Police Record Index System (EPRIS), for facilitating the location of information across the EU by law enforcement officers.       Analysis of instruments      Only six of the above mentioned instruments involve the collection and storage of personal data at EU level: SIS, VIS, Eurodac, CIS, Europol and Eurojust. The other instruments regulate the exchange or transfer of personal information that has been collected at national level. With the exception of SIS and VIS, these instruments have a single purpose. Similarly, the personal information collected may only be used for the single purpose defined by the instrument in question, except for that collected through SIS and VIS.     Access to information from instruments that aim at combating terrorism and serious crime is limited to the police and border control and customs authorities. Access to information from Schengen-related instruments is limited to immigration authorities and, in certain circumstances, to the police and border control and customs authorities. The information flow for centralised instruments is controlled by national interfaces and for decentralised instruments by national contact points or central coordinating units.      Set of core principles for future      There is a need to establish a set of core principles for future policy developments as well as for the evaluation of the current instruments. These should consist of substantive principles, such as:      the safeguarding of fundamental rights, especially of the right to privacy and personal data protection via “privacy by design”;       an assessment of the necessity of the new instrument in terms of its impact on an individual’s right to privacy and personal data protection;       compliance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality;       management of risk via risk profiles.      The set of core principles should also consist of process-oriented principles, such as:      cost-effectiveness, taking into consideration existing instruments;       bottom-up policy design, taking into consideration the interests of end-users;       clear allocation of responsibilities, paying particular attention to governance structures;       reporting and review obligations to ensure the instruments serve the purposes they were designed for.

act   Directive  2009/23/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on non-automatic weighing instruments (Codified version)   summary   This Directive aims at harmonising the rules which apply to non-automatic weighing instruments in order to ensure their free movement in the internal market and to protect the public against the consequences of incorrect weighing results.   Scope   This Directive covers weighing instruments used for:        —     commercial transactions;            —     the calculation of a toll, tariff, tax, bonus, penalty, remuneration, indemnity or similar type of payment;            —     the application of laws or regulations, or for an expert opinion given in court proceedings;            —     the practice of medicine, in particular for weighing patients for the purposes of monitoring, diagnosis and medical treatment;            —     making up medicines on prescription in a pharmacy and in analyses carried out in medical and pharmaceutical laboratories;            —     the determination of price on the basis of mass for the purposes of direct sales to the public and the making-up of pre-packages;            —     any other application.       Placing on the market   EU countries must to ensure that only instruments complying with the essential requirements set out in Annex I of the Directive and bearing the ‘CE’ marking are placed on the market. They may only block their placing on the market if they consider that these instruments do not meet the requirements of the Directive. In this case, they may prohibit or restrict their being placed on the market. They must inform the Commission thereof and give the reasons justifying their decision.   Conformity assessment   Manufacturers may choose between two conformity assessment methods to obtain the certificate of conformity for their products:        —     EC type examination followed by either the EC declaration of type conformity or EC verification;            —     EC unit verification.      EU countries must notify the Commission, as well as other EU countries, of the bodies which they have appointed to carry out conformity assessment procedures, the specific tasks assigned to these bodies, and their identification numbers.    ‘CE’  conformity marking and inscriptions   ‘CE’ conformity marking should be affixed in a visible and indelible form on instruments for which CE conformity has been established. Any other marking may be affixed provided that it does not hinder understanding by third parties of the signification of CE marking and that it does not reduce its visibility or legibility.   Repeal   Directive  2014/31/EU  repeals Directive 2009/23/EC with effect from 20 April 2016.

act   Council Framework Decision  2008/947/JHA  of 27 November 2008 on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments and probation decisions with a view to the supervision of probation measures and alternative sanctions.   summary    what does this framework decision do  The framework decision sets down the rules to be followed by each EU country to recognise judgments and supervise probation measures (enabling early release) and alternative sanctions (imposing alternatives to detention) issued by other EU countries. It seeks to:   increase the chances of the social reintegration of those who are sentenced by ensuring the follow-up in the EU country in which they are established of the measures imposed;   improve the protection of victims;   facilitate the application of probation measures and alternative sanctions if the offender does not live in the country of conviction.   key points    Probation measures and alternative sanctions   The framework decision lists a number of measures that each EU country must be able to supervise (such as the need to report to the executing authority, to repair damage caused, to not visit certain places, to avoid contact with people or objects, to perform community service, etc.).   Procedures, deadlines and grounds for refusal   The judgment (or the probation decision), accompanied by a  certificate,  is transmitted directly by the competent authority of the country of issue to that of the country of execution.  The execution country must decide, 60 days after receipt of the judgment or the probation measures and certificate, whether it recognises the judgment or the probation measures and whether it takes responsibility for monitoring its execution; the framework decision lists some reasons why a country may refuse to recognise a judgment.  The law of the executing country applies to the supervision and application of probation measures and alternative sanctions.  The competent authority of the country of execution:   may adapt the measures when, because of their nature or their duration, they are incompatible with its national legislation. It must inform the issuing authority of any proposed adaptation and ensure that measures are as consistent as possible with those imposed by the issuing country;   is responsible for taking any subsequent decision in connection with the supervision and enforcement of the sentence: the modification of obligations, any extension of the probationary period and the revocation of the suspension.   In a  report  published in 2014, the Commission called on EU countries that have not already done so to rapidly take the necessary measures to implement this framework decision.   when does the framework decision apply  The framework decision was to be implemented no later than 6 December 2011.   background   Each year, tens of thousands of EU citizens are prosecuted for alleged criminal offences or convicted in another EU country. Mutual recognition of judgments is the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in criminal matters within the EU.

   Plan to harmonise national rules on UCITS depositaries     Plan to harmonise national rules on UCITS depositaries     The European Commission would like to reduce the divergences that exist between the national rules governing depositaries entrusted with the safe keeping of assets on behalf on investors in undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS)       *      such as unit trusts, common funds and SICAVs. By following a step-by-step approach, the Commission, in cooperation with the national regulators, intends to facilitate the cross-border activity of such UCITS. There are four main areas of action: prevention of conflicts of interest, clarification of the depositary's liability, convergence of national prudential rules, and moves to enhance invstor transparency and information. UCITS are established in all Member States and their assets total some four thousand billion euros.     ACT     Commission Communication to the Council and the European Parliament of 30 March 2004 on "Regulation of UCITS depositaries in the Member States: review and possible developments" [       COM(2004) 207      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     In response to the conclusions of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council in June 2001 calling on it to prepare a report on the regulation of UCITS       *      depositaries and on the need to amend such regulation, the Commission is examining the existing legal framework. It notes that there are significant differences between Member States as regards, for example, minimum capital requirements, statutory and regulatory obligations, and the liability regimes for depositaries.     If cross-border activity is to expand, these rules must be harmonised. Fund managers and supervisory authorities will want to know exactly the resources and liabilities of depositaries established in other Member States before they are authorised to do business. In addition, investors will need to be better informed.     Favouring a step-by-step approach, the Commission is planning to entrust to regulatory experts in the European Union (EU) four areas of work for the period 2004-06: to promote better prevention of conflicts of interest; to clarify the extent of the depositary's liability; to promote convergence of prudential requirements, notably those relating to capital and to the taking-up and exercise of the function of depositary; to tighten the standards on investor transparency and information.     The Commission states that a chapter on depositaries will initially be attached to its overall UCITS report under Directive       2001/108/EC      in 2005. This chapter will specify to what extent EU legislation on the relationship between fund manager and depositary will have to be strengthened and what degree of harmonisation is needed as regards the typology of eligible depositary institutions and, consequently, their missions and resource requirements. A subsequent report reviewing progress is to be adopted in 2006. It will also evaluate whether is a need to legislate at Community level in order to create a fully-fledged European passport for expanding the cross-border activity of depositaries.      Better prevention of conflicts of interest      Conflicts of interest arise when the interests of investors are not the prime concern of the depositary or fund manager. The Commission is proposing measures to strengthen convergence of the relevant national rules. Such convergence will relate notably to the list of the functions that the fund manager can delegate to the depositary and, conversely, the list of the functions that the depositary may delegate.      Clarification of the extent of the depositary's liability      The differences in the level and extent of the depositary's liability are a major obstacle if there is to be a high level of investor protection throughout the EU and if the scope for depositaries to engage in cross-border activities is to be expanded. The Commission thus regards it as essential that there should be a common reading of the main task of the depositary, namely asset safe keeping, and of the specific control duties assigned to the depositary.      Convergence of prudential requirements      The prudential rules governing the taking-up and pursuit of the activity of depositary differ significantly between Member States as there is no common European definition of eligible institutions. The Commission is proposing to align these rules more closely, particularly those relating to capital requirements, by identifying a specific group of institutions subject to prudential supervision.      Enhancement of transparency and investor information      The Commission identifies the areas where public information standards should be strengthened: organisation of the depositary's tasks, measures to prevent conflicts of interest, the depositary's liability and all the costs connected to his services.      Background      This communication is in response to the remit assigned to the Commission in June 2001 by he Economic and Financial Affairs Council. The approach it advocates is based on an extensive survey and on an Internet consultation in the autumn of 2002 concerning the different national rules impeding the development of the internal market in the case of UCITS depositaries. The survey identified major disparities between national rules that help to explain the current fragmentation of the market (in virtually 95% of cases UCITS depositaries are national institutions). The internet consultation revealed significant differences in connection, for example, with minimum capital requirements, statutory obligations and the extent of the depositary's liability. For there to be a genuine internal market in depositaries' services, these rules need to be brought into line.     Alongside the fund and its manager, the UCITS depositary is the third pillar of the European UCITS system set up by Directive       85/611/EEC      .     In 2001 the EU adopted       two other UCITS Directives amending Directive 85/611/EEC      (one focuses on the instruments in which funds may invest and the other on management companies, thereby setting in place a "European passport" scheme).       Key terms used in the act         UCITS: Depending on the jurisdiction, UCITS can be constituted either under the law of contract (as common funds) or trust law (as trusts) and also under statute, i.e. in corporate form (as investment companies). The Directive may refer to both non-corporate forms under one designation, e.g. as common funds or unit trusts. Importantly, some Member States' legal frameworks are limited to common funds, i.e. all their UCITS are without legal personality and depend on a designated external fund manager (a management company).         UCITS depositary: Directive           85/611/EEC          UCITS fund manager: This may be either a "management company" or a "self-managed investment company". Unlike common funds or unit trusts, corporate UCITS, i.e. investment companies, may bring together a vehicle (the fund) and a fund management capacity into the same entity.

summary of   Communication (COM(2000) 1final) on the precautionary principle   what is the aim of the communication   It explains the precautionary principle which enables a rapid response to be given in the face of a possible danger to human, animal or plant health, or to protect the environment.   In particular, where scientific data do not permit a complete evaluation of the risk, recourse to this principle may, for example, be used to stop distribution or order withdrawal from the market of products likely to be hazardous.   It establishes  common guidelines  on the application of the precautionary principle.   key points   The  precautionary principle  is detailed in  Article 191 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union  . It aims at ensuring a higher level of environmental protection through preventative decision-taking in the case of risk. However, in practice, the scope of this principle is far wider and also covers consumer policy,  European Union (EU) legislation concerning food  and human, animal and plant health.  The definition of the principle shall also have a positive impact at international level, so as to ensure an appropriate level of environmental and health protection in international negotiations. It has been recognised by various international agreements, notably in the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement (SPS) concluded in the framework of the  World Trade Organisation  (WTO).   Recourse to the precautionary principle   According to the  European Commission  the precautionary principle may be invoked when a phenomenon, product or process may have a dangerous effect, identified by a scientific and objective evaluation, if this evaluation does not allow the risk to be determined with sufficient certainty.  Recourse to the principle belongs in the general framework of  risk analysis  (which, besides risk evaluation, includes risk management and risk communication), and more particularly in the context of  risk management  which corresponds to the decision-making phase.  The Commission stresses that the precautionary principle may only be invoked in the event of a potential risk and that it can never justify arbitrary decisions.  The precautionary principle may only be invoked when the  three preliminary conditions  are met:   identification of potentially adverse effects;   evaluation of the scientific data available;   the extent of scientific uncertainty.    Precautionary measures   The authorities responsible for risk management may decide to act or not to act, depending on the level of risk. If the risk is high, several categories of measures can be adopted. This may involve proportionate legal acts, financing of research programmes, public information measures, etc.   Common guidelines   The precautionary principle shall be informed by  three specific principles  :   the fullest possible scientific evaluation, the determination, as far as possible, of the degree of scientific uncertainty;   a risk evaluation and an evaluation of the potential consequences of inaction;   the participation of all interested parties in the study of precautionary measures, once the results of the scientific evaluation and/or the risk evaluation are available.   In addition, the  general principles  of risk management remain applicable when the precautionary principle is invoked. These are the following five principles:   proportionality between the measures taken and the chosen level of protection;   non-discrimination in application of the measures;   consistency of the measures with similar measures already taken in similar situations or using similar approaches;   examination of the benefits and costs of action or lack of action;   review of the measures in the light of scientific developments.    The burden of proof   In most cases, European consumers and the associations which represent them must demonstrate the danger associated with a procedure or a product placed on the market, except for medicines, pesticides and food additives.  However, in the case of an action being taken under the precautionary principle, the producer, manufacturer or importer may be required to prove the absence of danger. This possibility must be examined on a case-by-case basis. It cannot be extended generally to all products and processes placed on the market.   background   For more information, see:    Press release  on the European Commission's website.
act   Communication from the Commission: Ports: an engine for growth (  COM(2013) 295  final of 23.5.2013 - not published in the Official Journal)   summary    Importance of ports   The EU has over  1 200 ports  spread along its more than 70 000 km of coastline. Each year, 74 % of goods traded with non-EU countries pass through ports, as well as 37 % of intra-EU freight traffic and 385 million passengers.  Ports play an important role in the EU economy in terms of  jobs  , providing an estimated 3 million direct (port and port-related industries) and indirect (logistics/supply chain) jobs in a broad range of sectors among the 22 member countries with coasts.   Challenges    By 2030,  cargo volumes  handled in EU ports are expected to rise by 50 %. This means that new jobs will need to be created to handle the increased traffic.    Growing trend towards larger ships:  some ships can carry 18 000 containers which is equivalent to a continuous line of trucks stretching from Rotterdam to Paris.    Structural performance levels  vary widely: there is a  concentration of activity  in the most efficient ports because many do not have the necessary facilities or easy access. This results in congestion and longer journeys both on land and at sea leading to higher emissions.    Addressing the issues   To ensure that ports dynamise the EU’s economy in the coming decades, the strategy advocates actions to:    connect ports to the trans-European network:  more integrated infrastructure planning, consistent investment strategies and EU funding will be provided under the new trans-European transport network (TEN-T) guidelines; the Connecting Europe Facility and the Structural Funds will aim to ensure ports are connected with their hinterland and the wider transport network;    attract investment and modernise port services:   new EU rules  are proposed to increase transparency in public sector funding, ensure a fair competition between ports and attract private investors. The proposal will reduce legal uncertainties for port operators by introducing common rules for an open and non-discriminatory access to the market of port services.   Constructive  social dialogue  in the ports sector, and the importance both of  raising the environmental profile of ports  and of  innovation  having a central role in the sector are also emphasised.  The strategy is accompanied by a  proposa  l for a law designed to tackle the key issues related to the market access to port services and the financial transparency and autonomy of ports.
   ICT infrastructures for e-science     ICT infrastructures for e-science     The performance of information technology is constantly improving in terms of computation capacity, storage capacity and network speed. This generates new needs in terms of e-Infrastructures. It is now, therefore, essential to adapt ICTs to each phase of the scientific process. Investment in e-Infrastructures represents an opportunity to develop growth and employment, as well as to bring about a new scientific renaissance.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - ICT infrastructures for e-science [       COM(2009) 108 final      – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This Communication aims at developing the infrastructure of information and communication technologies (ICTs), also known as “e-Infrastructures”, in the area of e-science.      The potential of e-Infrastructures      The performance of information technology is constantly improving with regard to computation capacity, storage capacity and network speed. It allows new needs to be met in terms of modelling and simulation in sectors such as research into climate change or targeted healthcare but generates problems when designing e-Infrastructures.     It is therefore necessary to adopt ICTs to each phase of the scientific process, so that researchers can work together efficiently. This adoption will also allow the scope of research to be extended, which should generate, in the long term, a scientific renaissance and contribute to the success of the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs.      The current position of e-Infrastructures      The European Commission’s Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development has promoted the development and deployment of e-Infrastructures, in order to strengthen scientific excellence, and to promote innovation and industrial competitiveness.     GEANT is the world’s largest multi-gigabit communication network for researchers and educators. In Europe, GEANT is widely used and connects 34 National Research and Education Networks (NRENs).      E-science grids      (devoted to subjects such as high-energy physics and bioinformatics) are also present in Europe, in particular through EGEE which operates a multi-disciplinary grid with over 80  000 computers on 300 sites in 50 countries worldwide.      Scientific data      necessitates new tools and methods. Projects are being developed in Europe so that all scientific content resources are accessible through e-Infrastructure services.     A new supercomputer infrastructure has been identified by       ESFRI      as a priority to improve European scientific performance and meet socio-economic challenges. The combined action of Member States and the Commission will generate the creation of       PRACE      , a new European e-Infrastructure dedicated to high-performance computing.      Global Virtual Research Communities      are growing fast, which is opening up new perspectives for collaboration in the field of research on a worldwide scale.      European strategy for e-Infrastructures      The Commission proposes a renewed strategy to meet the challenges of e-science for 2020 and beyond. Three interrelated vectors are key to this strategy:      attaining worldwide leadership in e-science;       establishing e-Infrastructures;       exploiting these e-Infrastructures in order to promote innovation.       GEANT must continue to increase its performance      in collaboration with NRENs, so as to facilitate access to resources and equipment for researchers, educators and students. Both developed and developing regions must be covered. In this regard, Member States must prioritise the use of GEANT as an experimental platform.      Industry is to be invited to use European e-Science grids.      To this end, Member States must develop National Grid Initiatives (NGIs). The European Commission plans to facilitate interaction between European e-Science grids and global grids.      Access to scientific information must be improved      by developing data-centric science. Member States thus have a duty to invest in the field of scientific data infrastructures and exchange best practice.      A new generation of supercomputing facilities must be implemented.      The European Union must comply with the ESFRI objectives which aim to achieve peta-flop performance by 2010 and move towards exa-scale computing in 2020. Research and development in software and hardware must therefore be intensified so as to implement supercomputers. The preparatory work carried out by PRACE is a starting point for Member States that are also invited to invest in associated research fields. In the mid-term, the Commission will prepare a European scientific agenda in the field of supercomputing, covering the components, systems, software and services required.     Member States are also requested to fully exploit infrastructures to serve science and research. The objective is to       host global virtual research communities      .      Context      A new vision for the European Research Area based on the free movement of knowledge (the “fifth freedom”) was defined at the 2008 Ljubljana Council meeting. Moreover, the Aho Report of May 2008 highlighted the importance of developing infrastructures that would allow e-science to be disseminated. This indeed represents a new scientific revolution. It is essential for the European Union to be at the cutting edge of innovation in this field.

summary of   Regulation (EU) 2018/644 — cross-border parcel delivery services   what is the aim of the regulation  It aims to:   improve price transparency and regulatory oversight; and   ensure that citizens and small businesses have access to reasonably priced cross-border parcel delivery services.   key points    Scope   The regulation sets out rules for cross-border parcel delivery concerning 3 main aspects:    regulatory oversight  of parcel delivery services;    transparency of certain single-piece tariffs  through publication on a website; and    assessments where tariffs are subject to a universal service obligation   *  to identify those tariffs that are unreasonably high.    Information to be provided   Parcel delivery services are required to provide certain information to the  national regulatory authority  (NRA)  *  of the EU country in which they are based including:   name, legal status and form, company and VAT (value-added tax) registration, address and contact details;   characteristics and description of services offered;   general terms and conditions for their services, including complaints procedure;   by 30 June of each calendar year:   annual turnover;   number of persons employed;   number of parcels handled;   name of sub-contractors;   tariff list for the current year.     Companies  employing fewer than 50 people  and providing services only in the country in which they are established do not have to provide this information, although  exceptions  do apply.   Transparency   The tariffs subject to transparency measures will be published by the  European Commission  on a dedicated website by the  end of March  each year.   Assessment of cross-border tariffs   NRAs assess the affordability of the tariffs subject to the universal service obligation that they consider necessary to assess. They consider a number of elements including:   whether tariffs are affordable and cost-oriented, as well as transparent and non-discriminatory;   domestic and any other relevant tariffs for comparable parcel delivery services in both the dispatching EU country and the EU country of destination;   any application of a uniform tariff to 2 or more EU countries;   volumes, specific transportation or handling costs, other relevant costs and service quality standards;   the likely impact of the applicable cross-border tariffs on individual and  small- and medium-sized enterprise  users.   NRAs must submit an  assessment  to the Commission by the end of June of the relevant calendar year. A  non-confidential version  of the assessment must be published by the Commission within 1 month of its receipt.   Penalties   Rules for the penalties for infringing the regulation are set by EU countries and must be  effective, proportionate and dissuasive  .   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 22 May 2018.   background   For more information, see:    EU postal legislation  (  European Commission  )    Parcel delivery in the EU  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Universal service obligation:  EU countries must ensure that citizens are provided with a postal service of a specified quality anywhere in their country at an affordable price.   National regulatory authority (NRA):  a body that regulates postal services at national level. It ensures the proper functioning of the universal service obligation and undistorted competition in postal services.
act   Green Paper - Making the most out of Europe’s traditional know-how: a possible extension of geographical indication protection of the European Union to non-agricultural products (  COM(2014) 469 final  of 15 July 2014).   summary    what does this communication do  The purpose of the consultation document is to ask concerned groups whether there should be EU-wide geographical indication (GI) protection for non-agricultural products. The 45 questions range from what kind of sign should be protected to what the potential consequences are of an EU-wide GI protection system. The Commission will use their answers in deciding what further action to take.   key points    Applying GI protection to non-agricultural products could be beneficial economically. It could increase publicity for the place of origin, help maintain jobs in the area and allow producers to cooperate better. It could also lead to a reduction in abuses such as counterfeit goods.   Having a unified system may help in the trading of GI-protected products with countries outside the EU.   The current national systems available for the protection of non-agricultural products result in varying levels of GI protection across Europe. There is currently no overall EU system that guarantees GI protection.   When a GI is strong in consumers’ minds, imitators can take advantage. This can lead to economic losses for producers.   Since legal protection is currently provided at EU level for agricultural products and foodstuffs, a standardised protection system for other products would have to be compatible with the existing framework.   background   The issue of GI protection for non-agricultural products was identified by the European Commission in a 2011  communication  . This was followed by a  ‘Study on geographical indications for non-agricultural products in the internal market’  , the authors of which argued in favour of introducing GI protection at EU level. In 2013, a public hearing was held that further strengthened that position. The hearing subsequently led to the Commission publishing this paper, which seeks to gather together all interested stakeholders’ opinions.   key terms   Geographical indications (GIs) are signs used on goods that have a specific geographical origin and possess characteristics attributable to it. Using a GI can help producers enjoy fairer competition, while consumers get more reliable information regarding the products they are buying.

act   Regulation (EU) No  1151/2012  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 November 2012 on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs.   summary   EU Regulation 1151/2012 seeks to enhance Europe’s quality policy for agricultural products by  increasing the coherence  of various quality schemes. It includes measures to support agricultural and processing activities as well as the farming systems associated with high-quality products, in line with EU rural development policy objectives. However, the Regulation does not apply to spirit drinks, aromatised wines or grapevine products.  The Regulation’s main elements are:    One Regulation  for PDO (Protected Designation of Origin), PGI (Protected Geographical Indication) and TSG (Traditional Speciality Guaranteed).    One set of rules  for PDO, PGI and TSG as regards official controls, procedures, role of producers.    Strengthening and simplifying  the scheme for PDO, PGI and TSG.    Reinforcement and clarification  of the level of protection of registered names and the common EU symbols.    Shortening and simplifying of the procedure  to register names (PDO, PGI and TSG).   Labels for EU products marketed under a PDO, PGI or TSG registered in line with this Regulation must show the  Union symbol and name of the product (provision in force as from4.1.2016)  .    Creation of a new framework to develop optional quality terms  , providing consumers with extra information. This includes the new term  mountain product  .

   Action plan on unaccompanied minors (2010-14)     Action plan on unaccompanied minors (2010-14)     This action plan provides a common approach to tackling the challenges relating to the arrival in the European Union (EU) of large numbers of unaccompanied minors. The action plan is based on the principle of the best interests of the child.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council of 6 May 2010 – Action Plan on Unaccompanied Minors (2010 – 2014) [       COM(2010) 213      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     A significant number of unaccompanied minors arrive in the European Union (EU) each year. The term “       unaccompanied minors      ” refers to non-EU country nationals or stateless persons who are below the age of eighteen and who arrive in an EU country unaccompanied by a responsible adult or who are left unaccompanied after having entered an EU country.     Although EU legislative and financial instruments on asylum, immigration and trafficking in human beings address, either directly or indirectly, the situation of unaccompanied minors, greater coherence and better cooperation is needed within the EU as well as with countries of origin and transit. In order for the EU and its countries to respond more effectively, a       common approach      needs to be established that respects the rights of the child provided by the       EU Charter of Fundamental Rights      and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) and that is based on solidarity between the relevant countries and cooperation with civil society and international organisations.     This action plan identifies several problems and presents a number of solutions relating to the situation of unaccompanied minors. It acknowledges the lack of data on these minors and sets out three main strands for action: prevention, protection and durable solutions.      Data on unaccompanied minors      Comprehensive, reliable and comparable data is paramount to properly assessing and finding appropriate solutions to the situation of unaccompanied minors. Currently, the       regulation on statistics on migration      requires EU countries to only provide data on unaccompanied minors applying for international protection. This limitation needs to be overcome to obtain harmonised and complete statistics on all unaccompanied minors.     The information and data exchanges between EU countries should be improved with the help of existing agencies and networks, such as the       European Migration Network      and the       European Asylum Support Office      . Cooperation with countries of origin and transit should also be improved. To this end, the gathering of information on migration routes and criminal networks is essential. The systematic inclusion of this information in the migration profiles of the countries concerned should also be promoted. Both       Frontex      and       Europol      are already active in their respective fields; however, their roles with regard to data collection and analysis should be further reinforced.      Main strands of action      To effectively deal with the issue of unaccompanied minors, the first action must consist of       preventing      the unsafe migration and trafficking of children. In this context, consideration must be given to the different reasons the minors leave their country/region of origin and come to the EU. Therefore, central to the preventive work is collaboration with countries of origin and transit as well as with civil society and international organisations. Prevention involves four principal areas:      addressing the issue of migration of unaccompanied minors in other policy fields, such as development cooperation, poverty reduction, education, health and human rights;       promoting awareness-raising activities and training relating to early identification and protection of victims targeted at those who are or will be in contact with children in the countries of origin and transit;       promoting awareness-raising activities on the risks relating to irregular migration targeted at children and their families;       supporting the development of comprehensive child protection systems and birth registration systems.      EU and national external cooperation instruments should be used to support activities in these areas. At the same time, it is essential that protection programmes close to countries of origin continue to be financed.     Upon detection at the border or on the territory of the EU, an unaccompanied minor must be placed under appropriate       protection      . While provisions on reinforced protection are included in the relevant EU migration instruments, they are context-specific and do not provide the same standards of reception and assistance. The appointment of a representative for an unaccompanied minor should be guaranteed. It is also paramount to separate minors from adults to prevent (re)victimisation. In addition, minors should be provided with appropriate accommodation; detention should only be used in exceptional cases.     Early profiling of the type of minor, building trust and the use of measures provided by EU legislation are important for:      identifying the minor, assessing his/her age and tracing his/her family;       preventing the minor’s disappearance form care;       identifying/prosecuting the traffickers/smugglers.      In order to find       durable solutions      , each case should be assessed individually, keeping in mind the best interests of the child. An unaccompanied minor may either be:      returned and reintegrated in his/her country of origin, with priority given to voluntary return, in full respect of the safeguards provided by the “         Return Directive        ”;       granted an international protection or other legal status and integrated in the host country;       resettled to an EU country.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 638/2004 on statistics relating to the trading of goods between EU countries   what is the aim of the regulation   It sets up systems and procedures to simplify the operation of Intrastata system originally established in 1993, to collect information on the intra-European Union (EU) trade of goods.   It seeks to ensure that EU countries gather comparable and reliable data for transmission to Eurostat, the EU’s statistics office. The supply of such trading statistics is essential for the development of policies on the EU’s single market and for market analysis.   key points    Scope    The regulation covers trade in  goods  . ‘Trading of goods’ means any movement of merchandise from one EU country to another and ‘merchandise’ means all movable property, including electric current.   EU businesses that are registered for value added tax (VAT) purposes and whose annual trade amount exceeds a certain  threshold  must provide details of their transactions with other EU countries. These data relate both to  arrivals  (acquisitions, purchases or imports) and  dispatches  (removals, sales or exports). Other businesses are exempt from the requirement.   EU countries redefine the threshold value each year and fix a separate value for dispatches and arrivals (allowing for a minimum amount of data to be collected for each trade flow).    Registration   Each EU country’s national statistical authorities manage a  register of intra-EU operators  (i.e. businesses) made up of  consignors  and  consignees  .   Data collected for Intrastat   Businesses that are required to submit declarations for Intrastat purposes must provide the following information:   their identification number;   the reference period;   the flow (arrival/dispatch);   the commodity concerned (using the eight-digit code of the EU’s  combined nomenclature  );   the partner EU country;   the value of the goods in the national currency;   the quantity of the goods in net mass (weight excluding packaging) and the supplementary unit (litre, m  2  , number of items, etc.), if relevant;   the nature of the transaction.    Confidentiality   A party that provides information may request that their data receive statistical confidentiality. In this case, national authorities must decide whether the statistical results which make it possible to identify the said provider are to be disseminated or are to be amended so that their dissemination does not prejudice statistical confidentiality.   Transmission of data to Eurostat    EU countries transmit the monthly results of their statistics on the trading of goods between EU countries to Eurostat.   They are responsible for ensuring the  quality  of the data transmitted in accordance with the standards in force. The statistics must fulfil certain criteria:   relevance;   accuracy;   timeliness;   punctuality;   accessibility and clarity;   comparability;   coherence.     The  European Commission  , with the assistance of the  European Statistical System Committee  comprising EU countries’ representatives, is able to adopt certain technical changes in respect of this regulation.   when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 1 January 2005.   background    Intrastat was set up on 1 January 1993, the date on which the EU’s single market came into effect. It replaced customs declarations as a source of trade data.   For more information, see the  Eurostat  website.
summary of   Decision 2001/539/EC on the conclusion by the European Community of the Montreal Convention    Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air (the Montreal Convention)   what is the aim of the convention and of the decision   The convention aims to introduce uniform legal rules to govern air carrier liability in the event of damage caused to passengers, baggage or goods during international journeys.   The decision concludes the convention on behalf of the European Community (now the EU).   key points   The convention introduces comprehensive legal principles and rules the most important of which are:   the principle of an air carrier’s unlimited civil liability in the event of bodily injury; this splits into two tiers:   a  first tier of strict carrier liability  for damages of up to 100,000 SDRs (special drawing rights, as defined by the  International Monetary Fund  , i.e. around €120,000);   in excess of that amount, a  second tier of liability  based on the presumed fault of the carrier, which the latter may avoid only by proving that it was not at fault (the burden of proof is on the carrier);     the principle of making  advance payments  , in the event of bodily injury, to enable victims or the persons entitled to compensation to cover their immediate economic needs;   the possibility for the victim, or the persons entitled to compensation, to bring suits before the courts in the passenger’s principal place of residence;   an increase in the air carrier’s liability limits in the event of delay, and in the event of damage caused to baggage (delay, loss or damage);   modernisation of transport documents (electronic airway bills and tickets);   clarification of the rules on the respective liability of the contracting carrier (the air carrier whose name or code is on the air ticket) and the actual carrier (the carrier performing the flight may not be the same as the contracting air carrier);   generalised institution of the obligation for air carriers to maintain adequate insurance;   introduction of the so-called ‘regional’ clause allowing economic integration organisations, such as the EU, to accede to the convention.   In 1997, the EU adopted Regulation (EC) No 2027/97 (on  air carrier liability in the event of accidents  ) which imposes unlimited liability on EU air carriers in the event of death or injury to passengers.  Regulation (EC) No 889/2002  amends Regulation (EC) No 2027/97 and applies the rules of the Montreal Convention to all flights, whether domestic or international, operated by EU air carriers.   from when do the convention and the decision apply  The Montreal Convention entered into force on 4 November 2003. The decision has applied since 5 April 2001.   background   The inadequacy of the 1929  Warsaw Convention  , which governed air carriers’ liability for death and injury, and of its subsequent revisions led to the need to modernise and unify the rules on liability.  In May 1999, the Contracting States of the  International Civil Aviation Organisation  negotiated an agreement to modernise the Warsaw Convention rules, adapting them into a single legal instrument offering an appropriate level of compensation in the event of damage caused to passengers during international air transport.

   European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection     European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection     The European Commission sets out the principles and instruments needed to implement the European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP), aimed at both European and national infrastructure.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 12 December 2006 on a European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection [       COM(2006) 786      final – Official Journal C 126 of 7.6.2007].     SUMMARY     In December 2005, the Justice and Home Affairs Council called on the Commission to make a proposal for a European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection       *      (EPCIP). In response, the Commission adopted this communication and a proposal for a directive on the identification and designation of European critical infrastructure with a view to improving the protection of the latter.     The communication sets out the principles, processes and instruments proposed to implement EPCIP. The threats to which the programme aims to respond are not confined to terrorism, but also include criminal activities, natural hazards and other causes of accidents, using an all-hazards approach.     The general objective of EPCIP is to improve the protection of critical infrastructure in the European Union (EU). This will be achieved by implementing the European legislation set out in this communication.     The legislative framework for the EPCIP consists of the following:      a procedure for identifying and designating European critical infrastructure and a common approach to assessing the need to improve the protection of such infrastructure. This will be implemented by means of a         directive        ;       measures designed to facilitate the implementation of EPCIP, including an EPCIP action plan, the Critical Infrastructure Warning Information Network (CIWIN), the setting up of Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) expert groups at EU level, CIP information sharing processes, and the identification and analysis of interdependencies;       support for EU countries regarding National Critical Infrastructures (NCIs) that may optionally be used by a particular EU country, and contingency planning;       an external dimension;       accompanying financial measures, and in particular the Specific EU Programme on "         Prevention, Preparedness and Consequence Management of Terrorism and other Security Related Risks        " for the period 2007-13, which will provide funding opportunities for CIP related measures.       EPCIP action plan      The ECPIP action plan has three main work streams:      the first relates to the strategic aspects of EPCIP and the development of measures horizontally applicable to all CIP work;       the second concerns the protection of European critical infrastructures and aims to reduce their vulnerability;       the third is a national framework to assist EU countries in the protection of their NCIs.      The action plan is an ongoing process and regular reviews will be carried out.      Critical Infrastructure Warning Information Network (CIWIN)      A warning network (the CIWIN) will be set up by a specific Commission proposal for the purposes of exchanging best practices and providing an optional platform for the exchange of rapid alerts linked to the Commission's ARGUS system.      Expert groups      Where specific expertise is needed, the Commission may set up CIP expert groups at EU level to address clearly defined issues. Depending on the sector of critical infrastructure, the functions of experts may include:      assistance in identifying vulnerabilities, interdependencies and sectoral best practices;       development of measures to reduce vulnerabilities and of performance metrics;       formulation of case studies.       Information sharing on Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP)      Stakeholders must share information on CIP, particularly on measures concerning the security of critical infrastructure and protected systems, interdependency studies and CIP related vulnerability, threat and risk assessments. At the same time, there must be assurance that shared information of a proprietary, sensitive or personal nature is not publicly disclosed and that any personnel handling classified information will have an appropriate level of security vetting by their EU country.      Identification of interdependencies      To make a better assessment of the weak points, threats or risks relating to critical infrastructures, interdependencies of a geographic or sectoral nature must be identified and analysed.      CIP Contact Group      The Commission plans to set up a contact group for the protection of critical infrastructure. The contact points will be designated by each EU country and will be responsible for coordinating national CIP issues with other EU countries, the Council and the Commission.      Protection of National Critical Infrastructures (NCIs)      While recognising that the protection of NCIs is the responsibility of owners, operators and of EU countries themselves, the Commission does provide support in this area at the request of EU countries. Each EU country is encouraged to draw up a national protection programme including:      classification of NCIs, taking account of the effects of disruption or destruction of a particular infrastructure (geographic extent of the damage and seriousness of the consequences);       identification of geographic and sectoral interdependencies;       contingency planning.       External dimension      An important aspect of EPCIP is the external dimension of CIP. The interconnected and interdependent nature of modern economies means that disruption to or destruction of a particular infrastructure may have consequences for countries outside the Union and vice versa. It is therefore essential to strengthen international cooperation in this area through sectoral agreements.      Accompanying financial measures      The EPCIP will be co-financed by the Community Programme "Prevention, Preparedness and Consequence Management of Terrorism and other Security Related Risks" for the period 2007-13.      Historical background      On 17 and 18 June 2004, the European Council asked the Commission to prepare an overall strategy to enhance the protection of critical infrastructure. In response, on 20 October 2004, the Commission published the communication "       Critical infrastructure protection in the fight against terrorism      ".     The Commission's intention to propose a European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP) and a Critical Infrastructure Warning Information Network (CIWIN) was accepted by the European Council of 16 and 17 December 2004, both in its conclusions on prevention, preparedness and response to terrorist attacks and in the Solidarity Programme adopted by the Council on 2 December 2004.     Throughout 2005, intensive work was carried out on EPCIP. On 17 November 2005, the Commission adopted a Green Paper on a European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection.     On 15 September 2005, a decision on the financing of a pilot project containing a set of preparatory actions with a view to strengthening the fight against terrorism was adopted. This was followed by a second decision on 26 October 2006 on financing the EPCIP pilot project.     On 12 December 2006, the Commission presented a proposal for a directive on the identification and designation of European critical infrastructures and a common approach to assess the need to improve their protection. On the same day, the Commission also adopted this communication. These documents give a clear idea of how the Commission proposes to address the issue of critical infrastructure protection in the EU.     Finally, the proposed EU Programme on "Prevention, Preparedness and Consequence Management of Terrorism and other Security Related Risks" was adopted on 12 February 2007.       Key terms used in the act         Critical infrastructure: the physical and information technology facilities, networks, services and assets that, if disrupted or destroyed, would have a serious impact on the health, safety, security or economic well-being of citizens or the effective functioning of governments in EU countries.       RELATED ACTS      Proposal for a Council Decision of 27 October 2008 on a Critical Infrastructure Warning Information Network (CIWIN) [         COM(2008) 676        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      As foreseen in the communication above, this separate proposal aims to establish the Critical Infrastructure Warning Information Network (CIWIN). The CIWIN would provide EU countries with a secure information, communication and alert system for exchanging information relating to CIP. The system would facilitate cooperation between EU countries, allowing for exchanges on threats and vulnerabilities, as well as on strategies for improving the protection of critical infrastructure. EU countries’ participation in the network would remain voluntary. The CIWIN would consist of an electronic forum and a rapid alert system, the first for exchanging information and the latter for alerts on risks and threats. It would be a secure classified system, where access to information is regulated accordingly. The development of the technical aspects of the CIWIN is the responsibility of the Commission.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 437/2003 on collecting statistics about air passengers, freight and mail    Regulation (EC) No 1358/2003 implementing and amending Regulation (EC) No 437/2003   what is the aim of the regulations  In order to formulate the EU’s aviation policy, it needs to have comparable, consistent, synchronised and regular statistical data on the scale and development of the carriage of passengers, freight and mail by air within the EU. Regulation (EC) No 437/2003, therefore, aims to establish a solid statistical base for this purpose.  It is complemented by Implementing Regulation (EC) No 1358/2003 which contains important methodological information, such as airport categories on which reporting obligations are based, further definitions and coding guidelines.   key points   The objective of Regulation (EC) No 437/2003 is to collect reliable, regular, up-to-date, harmonised and comparable information on the carriage of passengers, freight and mail by air. Collecting common data on a comparable or harmonised basis makes it possible to provide an integrated system supplying reliable, consistent and prompt information.  Each EU country must collect statistical data on:   passengers;   freight and mail;   flights;   passenger seats available;   aircraft movements.   Each EU country must also collect all the specified data for all EU airports in its territory with more than150,000 passengers per year. Less-detailed statistics must be collected for airports with between 15,000 and 150,000 passengers, while airports with fewer than 15,000 passengers do not have to report.  Where possible, the collection of data must be based on available sources so as to minimise the burden on respondents. Where an EU country calls upon a respondent to provide information, the respondent is obliged to give true and complete information within the given deadline.  The collection of data must be based on complete returns unless other standards of accuracy are established by the  European Commission  . EU countries must transmit the results of the data processing, including data declared confidential, to  Eurostat  .  At the request of the Commission, EU countries must communicate all information concerning the methods used in the collection of data, as well as any substantive changes to those methods.  Regulation (EC) No 1358/2003 establishes the list of EU airports (apart from those having only occasional commercial traffic).  It contains very important methodological information — such as categories of airports — based on which the reporting obligations are set up, as well as additional definitions and codification guidelines.   from when do the regulations apply  Regulation (EC) No 437/2003 has applied since 31 March 2003.  Regulation (EC) No 1358/2003 has applied since 21 August 2003.   background   For more information, see:    Reference Manual on Air Transport Statistics  (  Eurostat  )    Eurostat transport database  (  Eurostat  )    Air transport statistics  (  Eurostat  ).   main documents   Regulation (EC) No  437/2003  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 February 2003 on statistical returns in respect of the carriage of passengers, freight and mail by air (OJ L 66, 11.3.2003, pp. 1-8)  Successive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 437/2003 have been incorporated into the basic text.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006 — establishing the statistical classification of economic activities   what is the aim of the regulation  It establishes a common statistical classification, covering all economic activities in the European Union (EU). This is known as NACE Rev. 2  *  (see key terms) and ensures compatibility between global, EU and national systems and statistics.   key points    NACE Rev. 2 contains 4 different levels (sections, divisions, groups and classes). Each is identified by 1 or 2 alphabetical letters and between 2 to 4 digits.   The 21 different sections are subdivided as follows:   agriculture, forestry and fishing;   mining and quarrying;   manufacturing;   electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply;   water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities   construction;   wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles, motorcycles;   transportation and storage;   accommodation and food service activities;   information and communication;   financial and insurance activities;   real estate activities;   professional, scientific and technical activities;   administrative and support service activities;   public administration and defence; compulsory social security;   education;   human health and social work activities;   arts, entertainment and recreation;   other service activities;   activities of households as employers; undifferentiated goods- and services-producing activities of households for their own use;   activities of extra-territorial organisations and bodies.     The  European Statistical System Committee  of national experts:   assists, and is chaired by, the  European Commission  ;   deals with issues linked to the classification system, such as interpretation, amendments, coordination, drafting explanatory notes and guidelines and cooperation with international organisations.     The legislation:   only applies to the use of the classifications for statistical purposes;   does not, as such, oblige EU countries to collect, publish or supply data.     from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 1 January 2008.   background    The smooth running of the single market requires EU-wide standards on the collection, transmission and publication of national and EU statistics. This ensures that companies, financial institutions, governments and other single market players have access to reliable and comparable statistical data.   The information helps companies to assess their competitiveness and EU institutions to prevent distortions of competition.   For more information, see:    ‘Glossary: Statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community (NACE)’  on Eurostat's website.   * key terms     NACE:  the acronym comes from the French  Nomenclature statistique des activités économiques dans la Communauté européenne  . Various versions have been developed since 1970.
act   Directive  2001/37/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2001 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products [  See amending act(s)  ].   summary   This Directive aims to approximate the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning:   the maximum tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide yields of cigarettes;   the warnings regarding health and other information to appear on unit packets of tobacco products;   certain measures concerning the ingredients and the descriptions of tobacco products.    Cigarettes: maximum yields   The Directive lays down maximum tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide yields for cigarettes released for free circulation, marketed or manufactured in the Member States. These maximum yields are lower than those laid down by Directive  90/239/EEC  concerning maximum tar yields and are extended to two other substances (nicotine and carbon monoxide).  From 1 January 2004, the maximum yields for cigarettes released for free circulation, marketed or manufactured in the Member States will be as follows:   10 mg per cigarette for tar;   1 mg per cigarette for nicotine;   10 mg per cigarette for carbon monoxide.   As regards measurement methods, tests are carried out on the basis of standards specified by approved laboratories designated by the Member States. The information must be submitted on an annual basis to the competent authorities in the Member States, which will forward it to the European Commission.  The Member States must also disseminate this information to consumers, taking account of any information which constitutes a trade secret.   Labelling   With regard to labelling, this Directive lays down the following provisions:    Maximum yields:  the information on the maximum yields for cigarettes must cover at least 10 % of the surface of the packet (12 % for a Member State with two official languages and 15 % for a Member State with three official languages). The Directive also specifies where this information is to be placed on the packet.    Warnings:  there are two types of compulsory warnings for all products (except for tobacco for oral use and other smokeless tobacco products): general warnings (Smoking kills/can kill or Smoking seriously harms you and those around you) and additional warnings (Smoking causes 90% of lung cancers, Smoking causes mouth and throat cancer, Smoking destroys your lungs, etc.), which vary on packets and whose list was updated in 2012.    Tobacco products for oral use and smokeless tobacco products:  there are separate provisions for these two categories of products, i.e. the following warning: This tobacco product can damage your health and is addictive.    Product identification and traceability:  the Directive provides for identification of the place and time of manufacture of the product by means of batch numbering or equivalent.    List of ingredients   Manufacturers and importers are required to submit to the Member States, on a yearly basis a list of all ingredients, and quantities thereof, used in the manufacture of tobacco products, together with toxicological data on their effects on health and any addictive effects. This list must be accompanied by a statement setting out the reasons for their inclusion. It must also be made public and be submitted to the Commission on a yearly basis.   Product descriptions   Since 30 September 2003, it is prohibited to describe a product as less harmful than another (by using names, figurative signs, etc.).   Tobacco for oral use   Member States shall prohibit the placing on the market of tobacco for oral use without prejudice to Article 151 of the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, which stipulates that the placing on the market in Sweden of tobacco for oral use may continue.   Effects on trade   As harmonisation and approximation of the rules relating to the internal market will lead to greater clarity and increased security for market operators, the overall economic effects are considered to be positive.   Implementation   The Directive provides for transitional periods for the application of its specific provisions (on maximum yields etc.). It also provides for a second transitional period in respect of the presentation and sale of products. In actual fact, products which do not comply with the provisions of the Directive may continue to be marketed for one year after the deadline for implementation in the Member States. For products other than cigarettes, the transitional period is increased to two years.  Adaptations of the Directive to scientific and technical progress will be taken into account by the Commission, assisted by a committee. The Commission will also be assisted by a group of experts for the control of tobacco, set up within its Advisory Committee on Cancer Prevention, particularly in connection with the preparation of a report on the application of the Directive.   Evaluation   Every two years, the Commission has to submit to the European Parliament, the Council and the Economic and Social Committee a report on the application of the Directive.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 introducing exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the EU’s stabilisation and association process   what is the aim of the regulation   The western Balkans (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo  *  , Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia) benefit from exceptional trade measures for their imports into the EU. These countries and territories are part of the  stabilisation and association process  .   Under the bilateral agreements concluded with the western Balkans, nearly all products originating from those countries and territories already have unlimited duty-free access to the EU market.   The regulation provides additional trade preferences for some agricultural products (fruits, vegetables and wine) originating from the region. The measures which originally applied until 31 December 2010 were extended until 31 December 2020 by Regulation (EU)  2015/2423  , which amends Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009.    Trade preferences    Products originating  in the western Balkans and covered in Chapters 7 and 8 of the EU’s  Combined Nomenclature   *  (fruits and vegetables) may be imported into the EU without customs duties  *  or charges having equivalent effect and without quantitative restrictions  *  or measures having equivalent effect. The exceptional preferences also include a global wine quota of 30.000 hl which can be used by each country or territory after exhaustion of its national quota under its bilateral agreement concluded with the EU.   Conditions for entitlement   To benefit from the preferential measures, countries and territories must:    comply with the definition of originating products  provided for in Regulation (EU) No  952/2013  in the  EU Customs Code  — the products must have been wholly manufactured or have undergone sufficient processing in the country or territory;   undertake  not to increase the level of taxes or restrictions  on products imported from the EU;    combat fraud  by means of administrative cooperation with the EU;   not engage in serious and systematic violations of  human rights  , including core labour rights, and respect the principles of democracy and the  rule of law  .   Beneficiaries should also engage in effective economic reforms and in cooperation with other countries concerned by the stabilisation and association process, in particular through the  creation of a regional free-trade area  .  The  European Commission  may propose that trade preferences be suspended  in whole or in part  if a country or territory fails to comply with its obligations.  Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 sets out  procedures for the implementation of tariff quotas   *  in relation to agricultural products. Currently, the system applies to wine of fresh grapes not exceeding 15% volume, other than sparkling wine for which there is an exemption in relation to a quota of  30.000 hl  shared between the various western Balkan countries and territories. The share of this quota per country is laid down in the protocols on wine signed with each of them when they signed their respective stabilisation and association agreements with the EU.  The Commission may take  protective measures  if imports of agricultural products cause serious disturbance to the EU’s internal market.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 4 January 2010. Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009  codifies  and replaces Regulation (EC) No  2007/2000  (and its subsequent amendments).   background   For more information, see:    Enhanced EU engagement with the western Balkans  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Combined Nomenclature:  a means of classifying goods to determine which rate of customs duty applies and how the goods are treated for statistical purposes or for other EU policies.   Customs duties:  a duty which alters the price of an imported product, irrespective of its name or technique, which results in a restriction on the free movement of goods.   Quantitative restriction:  any trade regulation which may have the effect of limiting imports of goods, in terms of quantity or value (e.g. import quota).   Tariff quota:  a trade measure which permits the total or partial suspension of the duties normally paid on an imported product, during a period of time or for a limited volume.

   Integration of the environmental dimension in developing countries     Integration of the environmental dimension in developing countries     The European Union lays down the procedure for allocating Community economic and technical aid to promote the full integration of the environmental dimension in cooperation projects between the Community and developing countries (DCs). As of 1 January 2007 those rules have been replaced by the Regulation establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation.     ACT     Regulation (EC) No       2493/2000      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 November 2000 on measures to promote the full integration of the environmental dimension in the development process of developing countries.     SUMMARY     1. Because of the direct impact they have on economic development, the depletion of natural resources and the impairment of the environment may thwart efforts to alleviate poverty in developing countries.     2. This has been recognised in several agreements concluded, with the Community's participation, in the framework of the United Nations (Framework Convention on climate change, Convention on biological diversity, etc.) and the OECD (Shaping the 21st century strategy).     3. The Regulation lays down the rules under which cooperation projects initiated by various players (governments, public bodies, regional authorities, traditional or local communities, cooperatives, international organisations, non-governmental organisations and private stakeholders) in developing countries and intended to promote sustainable development may receive financial aid and technical assistance from the Community.     4. Activities eligible for aid and assistance address, in particular:      global environmental issues (climate change, desertification, biological diversity, etc.);       transboundary issues (air, water and soil pollution);       the environmental impact of the integration of developing countries into the world economy and of their macroeconomic and sectoral policies;       the inclusion in development cooperation projects of environmental considerations for evaluating the sustainable management of such activities;       conservation of biological diversity, sustainable management and use of natural resources, and fair and equitable sharing of the benefits drawn from these resources;       issues relating to fishing and the management of coastal zones, estuaries and wetlands;       desertification;       urban environment problems (waste, noise and air pollution, water quality, etc.);       sustainable production and use of energy;       sustainable production and use of chemical products;       environmental problems related to industrial activities;       sustainable patterns of production and consumption.      5. They may take the following forms:      pilot projects in the field;       schemes to build up the institutional and operational capacities of actors in the development process (governments, civil society, NGOs, etc.);       drawing up of policies, plans, strategies and programmes for sustainable development;       formulation of guidelines, operating manuals and instruments aimed at promoting sustainable development (databases on the Internet);       support for the development and application of environment assessment tools;       inventory, accounting and statistical work to improve the quality of environmental data;       making local populations and key actors in the development process aware of sustainable development issues;       promotion of trade in environment-friendly products;       support for multilateral processes.      6. In selecting activities eligible for support, particular attention is given to the following criteria:      linkage with the overall objective of eradicating poverty;       local initiatives involving innovative measures;       active involvement of indigenous communities;       the specific role and contribution of women in the sustainable management and use of natural resources;       consistency with other development cooperation programmes;       strengthening of regional cooperation on sustainable development;       internalisation of environmental costs.      7. For each cooperation activity, the Community requires a contribution from the actors concerned according to their means. Community financial support is provided in the form of non-refundable aid. Such funding may cover technical assistance, studies, training, supplies, minor works, missions and small grant funds.     8. The Regulation emphasises that participation in invitations to tender and the award of contracts is open to all persons and all companies of the Member States and of the recipient country on equal terms. It may also be extended to other developing countries and, in exceptional cases, to other third countries. A guide setting out the criteria applicable in the selection of projects will be published and provided to interested parties.     9. The Commission is responsible for decisions and management relating to projects undertaken pursuant to the Regulation and will take all necessary coordination measures. It reports to the European Parliament every two years on strategic guidelines and priorities for the years ahead. It must also submit an annual report to Parliament and the Council summarising the activities financed during that year and evaluating the implementation of the Regulation. The Commission must regularly inform the Member States of the activities that have been approved, stating their cost and nature, the country concerned and the cooperation partners.     10. In the case of projects involving financing of EUR 2.5 million or more, the Commission is assisted in its management tasks and its decision-making by the geographically determined committee responsible for development.     11. The budget for applying the Regulation over the period 2000-2006 is EUR 93 million.     12. As of 1 January 2007 the Regulation has been repealed and replaced by the Regulation establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation (see "Related acts" below).      BACKGROUND      13. In Council Regulation (EC) No       722/97      on environmental measures in developing countries in the context of sustainable development [Official Journal L 108, 25.4.1997], the Council lays down a framework for Community aid to help developing countries integrate the environmental dimension into their development process. As Regulation (EC) No       722/1997      ceased to apply on 31 December 1999, the purpose of Regulation (EC) No       1905/2006      is to continue the Community action on the basis of experience acquired during the implementation of the former Regulation.

In the context of the 2007-2013 financial perspective, this Regulation establishes a financing instrument for development cooperation providing direct support for the Community's policy in this field. The policy is aimed at achieving the objectives of poverty reduction, sustainable economic and social development and the smooth and gradual integration of developing countries into the world economy. The Regulation repeals and replaces Regulation (EC) No       2493/2000      as of 1 January 2007.      Council Conclusions of 31 May 2001: Strategy for the integration of environmental considerations into development policy to promote sustainable development.      In this strategy, the Council underlines the importance of integrating environmental considerations into all Community initiatives in the field of development cooperation. Priority should be given to:      enhanced policy dialogue with partner countries on environmental issues;       systematically incorporating environmental considerations into the preparation of all strategic plans and programmes for EC development cooperation;       mainstreaming environmental considerations into the six priority themes for EC development cooperation, namely trade and development, regional cooperation, poverty reduction, transport, food security and institutional capacity building;       monitoring the progress made.

summary of   Decision No 70/2008/EC replacing paper-format customs procedures with EU-wide electronic ones   what is the aim of the decision  It aims to promote  electronic customs (e-customs)  in the  European Commission  . Such systems facilitate trade by reducing costs and coordinating procedures. They also permit the exchange of data between the customs administrations of EU countries, traders and the Commission. In this way, they improve and facilitate supply chain logistics and customs processes.   key points   Following on from the 2003  communication on creating a simple and paperless environment for customs and trade  , it was agreed under this decision that the Commission and the EU countries would set up:   secure;   integrated;   interoperable; and   accessible e-customs systems for the exchange of   data contained in customs declarations   documents accompanying customs declarations and certificates and   other relevant information.     The Commission and the EU countries are to establish the structure and means for the operation of those e-customs systems.   Measures   To meet the objectives set out in the decision, the EU needs to:   harmonise the exchange of information;   review customs processes with a view to optimising their efficiency and effectiveness;   offer traders a wide range of e-customs services.    The Commission’s role   The  Commission  must coordinate:   the setting-up, testing, operation and maintenance of the EU components of the computerised systems;   the systems and services set out in this proposal with other projects concerning e-government services;   the parallel development of national and EU elements;   automatic customs services and single-window services  *  at EU level;   the completion of the tasks allocated to it under a multiannual strategic plan;   training needs.   The Commission must also monitor progress with regard to the Customs Policy Group. It must also initiate  regular consultations  with the economic stakeholders concerned.   Role of EU countries   EU countries must ensure the following:   the setting-up, testing, operation and maintenance of the  national components  of the computerised systems;   the coordination of the systems and services provided for in this decision with other relevant projects relating to e-government at national level;   the completion of the tasks allocated to them under the multiannual strategic plan and work programmes — the latest work programme is contained in Commission Implementing Decision (EU)  2016/578  on developing and deploying the electronic systems needed to implement the  EU Customs Code  (which replaced the  Community Customs Code  );   the promotion and implementation at national level of  e-customs services  and  single-window services  ;   training for officials.    Timetable for automated customs services   The decision contains a list of systems and databases and sets out the timetable for their implementation.  Single-window services  should be available within 6 years.   Financing   The decision states that the costs of its implementation were to be shared between the EU and EU countries based on their EU or national character. EU countries were to develop cost-sharing models. Currently, EU aspects of the work to modernise customs receive funding under the  Customs 2020 action programme  .   from when does the decision apply  It has applied since 15 February 2008.   background   For more information, see:    Electronic customs  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Single-window services:  a facility which allows parties involved in trade and transport to lodge standardised information and documents with a single entry point to fulfil all import, export and transit-related regulatory requirements. If information is electronic, individual data elements only need to be submitted once.
summary of   Directive 2014/45/EU on periodic roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers   what is the aim of the directive  It aims to improve road safety by setting minimum requirements for periodic roadworthiness tests of vehicles and trailers in the EU.   key points    Scope   The law applies to vehicles capable of more than 25 km/hour in the following categories:    passenger cars and light commercial vehicles  (categories M  1  and N  1  ): to be tested 4 years after the date when first registered, and thereafter every 2 years;   vehicles in category M  1  used as taxis or ambulances, buses or minibuses (M  2  , M  3  ), heavy goods vehicles (N  2  , N  3  ) and heavy trailers (O  3  , O  4  ): to be tested 1 year after first registration, and thereafter yearly;    fast tractors  with a design speed above 40km/h (T  5  ) and used commercially: to be tested 4 years after registration, and thereafter every 2 years.    Powerful motorcycles   Category L vehicles with an engine larger than 125 cm  3  will be tested from 2022 unless road safety statistics for the previous 5 years show that the same level of road safety could be achieved by alternative measures.   Roadworthiness tests prior to the due dates   In certain circumstances, vehicles may be required to undergo a test  before  the due dates:   after an accident;   where the holder of the registration certificate has changed;   on reaching 160,000 km;   in cases where road safety is seriously affected.    Exemptions   The following types of vehicle are exempted from roadworthiness tests:   vehicles of historic interest,   diplomatic vehicles,   vehicles used by the armed forces, police, customs, fire services or for agricultural and forestry purposes only, as well as   vehicles used exclusively on small islands.    Approved testing centres   Each EU country must have approved and compliant testing centres, while inspectors must meet competence criteria and be free from any conflict of interest.   Assessment of defects    Defects are classified as minor, major or dangerous, with minor defects insufficient to fail vehicles.   Where defects are dangerous, the use of the vehicle on public roads may be suspended until the fault is rectified.    Roadworthiness certificate   Where a vehicle already registered in another EU country is re-registered, its certificate must be recognised by other EU countries, even where ownership has changed. By 2021, testing centres will be required to share relevant information with the competent authority of their country.   European electronic vehicle information platform   The feasibility, costs and benefits of setting up a  European electronic vehicle information platform  are to be examined.   Fraud    To detect odometer fraud, data from the preceding test is to be made available to the inspectors.   Misrepresenting the distance a vehicle has covered is a punishable offence.    COVID-19 pandemic    Regulation (EU)  2020/698  lays down specific and temporary measures in view of the COVID‐19 outbreak concerning the renewal or extension of certain certificates, licences and authorisations and the postponement of certain periodic checks and periodic training in certain areas of transport legislation.   The regulation extends the time limits provided for in Directive 2014/45/EU with regard to:   roadworthiness tests which should have been be carried out between 1 February 2020 and 31 August 2020 by a period of 7 months;   roadworthiness certificates, which should have been be carried out between 1 February 2020 and 31 August 2020 by a period of 7 months;   where an EU country considers that the carrying out of roadworthiness tests or the certification thereof is likely to remain impracticable beyond 31 August 2020, due to the COVID-19-related measures that it has taken, it may submit a reasoned request to the European Commission by 1 August 2020 for an authorisation to extend the periods.That request may concern the period between 1 February 2020 and 31 August 2020 or the period of seven months, or both.     from when does the directive apply  The directive had to become law in the EU countries by 20 May 2017. EU countries have to apply the rules as of 20 May 2018.   background   For further information, see:    Road safety  (  European Commission  ).
   The future of health care and care for the elderly: guaranteeing accessibility, quality and financial viability     The future of health care and care for the elderly: guaranteeing accessibility, quality and financial viability     All national health care systems are today faced with three major challenges, as the population of Europe is ageing, health care is increasingly effective but also becoming more expensive, and patients, having become true consumers, are also more demanding. Faced with these three challenges, the Commission has proposed three long-term objectives: access to health care for all, a high level of quality in health care and ensuring the financial viability of health care systems.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 5 December 2001 - The future of health care and care for the elderly: guaranteeing accessibility, quality and financial viability [       COM(2001) 723      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The EU's overall health situation and health care systems are among the best in the world, thanks to the widespread extension of cover against sickness and invalidity, the rise in the standard of living, improved living conditions and better health education.     Total health care spending rose from around 5 % of GDP in 1970 to over 8 % in 1998. Public health care spending followed the same trend of growing faster than GDP in most countries.      ISSUES COMMON TO ALL EU HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS       The impact of demographic ageing on health care systems and expenditure      The ageing of the population in Europe involves two aspects:      since 1970, life expectancy at birth has risen by 5.5 years for women and almost 5 years for men. This trend also means higher life expectancy in "good health" and in the absence of disability;       there are more elderly people. The proportion of the total European population older than 65 is set to increase from 16.1 % in 2000 to 27.5 % by 2050, while the proportion of the population aged over 80 years (3.6 % in 2000) is expected to reach 10 % by 2050.      If Eurostat's basic scenarios are confirmed, public expenditure on health care could increase by between 0.7 and 2.3 GDP points in the period 2000-2050.     The increase in the numbers of elderly people will thus increase the pressure on the public sector for long-term care.     In light of these needs, health care structures, methods of financing and the organisation of services will have to evolve. It will be particularly important to deal with the increased need for skilled manpower, as smaller and more unstable family structures make it increasingly difficult to rely on the support of family networks.      The growth of new technologies and treatments      Developments in medical technology (gene therapies, growing replacement organs, new medicinal substances, etc.) provide benefits for patients, for example by reducing the risks of serious illness by means of preventive treatment. However, these innovations come at a cost, and financing is an issue that must be considered. In the context of prudent budget management, clear, transparent and effective evaluation mechanisms must be developed, as this is the only way to guarantee greater accessibility to these new products and treatments.      The increase in patients' demands      It has been observed for half a century that the demand for health care tends to increase more than proportionally to the per capita income. Demand is determined by standard of living and level of education. This has three main consequences:      patients are better educated and are able to adopt healthier lifestyles and a prevention-based attitude which in the long run makes it possible to avoid the need for costly care. This is why health care systems are focusing increasingly on education and prevention;       patients expect ever better quality and efficiency from health care systems. The spread of information technologies gives patients access to more information on services available at European level and allows them to make an increasingly well-informed choice;       health care consumers feel that they need to be considered as partners and players in health care systems, not only by health professionals but also by the public authorities. They also expect greater transparency on the performance and quality of care services.       THREE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES: ACCESSIBLITY, QUALITY, VIABILITY      While the organisation of health care systems, their funding (ratio of public/private funding) and planning as a function of the needs of the population are a matter for the Member States, this responsibility is exercised increasingly within a general framework on which many Community policies have a bearing (research, public health policy, free movement of persons and services, viability of public funds). This is an argument for strengthening European cooperation.     The Communication identifies three long-term objectives for national systems, which should be pursued in parallel.      Accessibility      Access to health care is a right enshrined in the       Charter of Fundamental Rights      of the European Union. However, it is often affected by an individual's social status. It is therefore particularly important to ensure that access to health care for disadvantaged groups and for the poorest members of society is guaranteed.     The joint report to evaluate the national action plans for social inclusion proposes three categories of measures:      measures to develop disease prevention and promote health education (mother and child care, medical care at school and medical care at work);       providing less expensive and even free care for those in low-income brackets;       measures aimed at disadvantaged groups, e.g. the mentally ill, migrants, the homeless, alcoholics and drug addicts.       Quality      In order to provide quality health care, national governments are required to achieve an optimum balance between the health benefits and the cost of medication and treatment. Ascertaining quality in this way is made complex by:      the diversity of the structures and levels of health care, which often influence demand for health care and consequently the level of expenditure;       the different approaches to medical treatment.      Comparative analysis of health care systems and medical treatment should make it possible to identify "best practice" and thus to help improve the quality of health care systems.      Financial viability      A certain level of financing is required to ensure the availability of high-quality health care that is accessible to the population. There is upward pressure on these health care costs, irrespective of the way in which Member States' health care systems are organised. Member States have been undertaking reforms since the early 1990s, based mainly on two methods:      regulation of demand, by increasing contributions or by ensuring that the final consumer bears an increasingly large share of the costs;       regulation of supply, by determining budgets or resource envelopes for health care providers, creating a contractual relationship between "buyers" and "providers" of health care.      It is often difficult, however, to distinguish the short-term effects from the more structural effects of these reforms, which allow spending to develop at a sustainable pace. This Communication recommends more exchanges of experience, which would help to keep track of the policies introduced and would be a useful way of comparing health care systems and encouraging progress.     In order to achieve these objectives it is essential that all parties concerned (local authorities, health care professionals, social protection bodies, supplementary insurance companies, consumers) work together to build strong partnerships.      Background      This Communication is a response to the conclusions of the       Lisbon European Council      of March 2000, which stressed that social protection systems needed to be reformed in order to be able to provide high-quality health care services. It also takes up the request made by the Gothenburg summit (June 2001) to prepare a progress report for the Spring 2002 European Council suggesting guidelines in the field of health and care for the elderly.       Key figures         life expectancy in 2000: 74.7 for men and 81.1 for women         life expectancy in 2050 (Eurostat forecast): 79.7 for men and 85.1 for women         percentage of people aged over 65 in Europe in 2000: 16.1 %         percentage of people aged over 65 in Europe in 2050: 27.5 %         percentage of people aged over 80 in Europe in 2000: 3.6 %         percentage of people aged over 80 in Europe in 2050: 10 %       RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission of 20 April 2004 - Modernising social protection for the development of high-quality, accessible and sustainable health care and long-term care: support for the national strategies using the "open method of coordination" [         COM(2004) 304        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      This Communication proposes that the "open method of coordination" be extended to the health and long-term care sector. This will allow a framework to be established to promote exchanges of experience and best practices and support the Member States in the reform of health care and long-term care.      Joint report from the Commission and the Council on health care and care for the elderly:         Supporting national strategies for ensuring a high level of social protection        .      The Barcelona European Council (2002) invited the Commission and the Council to examine more thoroughly the questions of access, quality and financial sustainability. A questionnaire was sent to the Member States in 2002 in order to collect information on their approaches to these three objectives. The joint report is based on the responses received.     This joint report was adopted by the "Employment, Social Affairs, Health and Consumer Affairs" Council on 6 March and by the "Economic and Financial Affairs" Council on 7 March as a contribution to the March 2003 European Council.

   Trans-European networks: towards an integrated approach     Trans-European networks: towards an integrated approach     The transport, energy and telecommunications infrastructures have been designed on national lines and need to be harmonised, connected and integrated into the wider European context via the Trans-European Networks (TENs). At the same time, environmental concerns require the design and layout of the infrastructures to be reworked. Consequently, the European Commission assessed the TENs in 2006 and is now delivering the findings of the steering group responsible for examining a possible joint approach to TENs.     ACT     Commission Communication of 21 March 2007 to the Council and the European Parliament entitled: "Trans-European Networks: Towards an integrated approach" [       COM(2007) 135      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The trans-European networks (TENs) constitute an ambitious and essential objective for the competitiveness of the European Union and therefore for growth and jobs. Several major industrial programmes such as       GALILEO      ,       ERTMS      and       SESAR      are following the logic of Europeanisation of transport infrastructures, often designed only according to national requirements.     Sustainable use of resources is a key element in TEN policy, since the most environmentally-friendly procedures enjoy a privileged status amongst the priority projects.      Assessment of TENs in 2006      The completion of 30 priority       transport      projects is behind schedule as the new, very costly infrastructures required have not been granted sufficient resources. The network is still incomplete, with investments of EUR 160 billion needed to finance the priority projects alone for the financial programming period 2007-2013. The European Regional Development Fund (       ERDF      ) and the       Cohesion Fund      remain the principal sources of Community intervention, and the European Investment Bank (       EIB      ) will continue to fund the infrastructures via its loans and a specific Guarantee Instrument.     The Community has recently adopted guidelines aimed at updating the trans-European energy networks (Decision No       1364/2006/EC)      . Some 42 projects, including 10 relating to gas networks, have been declared of European interest. The EU must invest at least EUR 30 billion in infrastructures between now and 2013. Between 2000 and 2006, approximately EUR 140 million was invested in the trans-European energy networks under the TEN budget. A figure of EUR 155 million has been earmarked for the financial period 2007-2013. The Commission has stressed here again, however, that the allocated amounts are limited in light of the issues at stake and actual requirements.     Investments in       telecommunications      are currently focused on modernising existing networks. The Commission has highlighted the disparities between urban and rural areas (already identified in its communication entitled       Bridging the Broadband Gap      ) and invites the Member States to take concrete measures and define goals for reducing these differences by 2010. Public aid is encouraged in the event of market failure, in strict compliance with telecommunications and State aid regulations. A map of the infrastructures is needed to help the competent authorities assess their requirements and take advantage of ongoing civil engineering work.      Towards an integrated approach: the findings of the steering group      The steering group set up on 20 July 2005 at the request of the Commission has examined the possible synergies between the trans-European networks along with methods of funding and potential distribution. It has established that combinations of rail and road networks have shown themselves to be of significant value (more efficient use of space, reduced costs and environmental impact) and there are definite advantages in linking the two types of TEN. Synergies between the transport and telecommunications networks seem the most promising and ways of interconnecting the electricity networks are also worth exploring.     The steering group also underlined the potential environmental benefits of integrating the TEN. In fact, the 30 priority projects involving the trans-European transport network largely favour methods of transport which are more fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly, such as rail or water. Interconnections between the national energy networks and connections with renewable energy sources will also optimise the use of available capacities in each Member State, thus reducing the environmental impact.     The steering group recommends:      continuing research into synergies between the TENs with the aim of producing and circulating a manual of good practices, and developing synergies between the objectives of cohesion policy and the priorities adopted in the TEN context;       evaluating the need for alternative solutions for availability payments over several financial periods and making appropriate legislative proposals if necessary;       monitoring the development of public-private partnerships and promoting this type of funding;       completing TEN priority projects on schedule while ensuring the application of environmental law.       New technologies      A midterm review of the       2001 White Paper on transport policy      acknowledges the role of new information and communication technologies in ensuring that people and goods can travel safely and sustainably. Numerous schemes, including the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITSs), the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) and the European satellite navigation project GALILEO, represent effective tools for increasing safety and reducing congestion and environmental impact.     The group thus recommends that investments in the ITSs be integrated, from the early planning stages, into all new trans-European transport network (TEN-T) projects.      Legal clarification on non-cumulation of Community funds       The steering group concluded that there must be no possibility of cumulation of subsidies from several Community funds and has confirmed the need to maintain a consistent approach across the various legal instruments. Thus, when granting aid under the TEN arrangements, the Commission will check whether or not the projects have already received aid from the Structural or Cohesion Funds      .     According to the steering group, delays in the priority transport projects are largely due to difficulties in reconciling the rules for granting Community subsidies from the TEN budget with the actual financial needs of the projects. The new TEN regulation should make it easier to part-finance the major cross-border projects, which are technically and financially complex.     The steering group also stressed the advantages of funding by public-private partnerships (       PPP      ), and the benefits of a European Guarantee Instrument (provided by the EIB) to encourage the PPPs to fund the TEN-Ts. Such a system could help to lessen the risks linked to insufficient revenue during the initial years of operation of a project, and generate a considerable lever effect.     Based on the availability risk, PPPs will also form an integral part of the forms of subsidies eligible for Community financial support under the new regulation on transport and energy TENs.

Its main purpose is to implement the Kimberley Process certification scheme (KPCS)  *  , which aims to ensure that rough diamond purchases are not used for financing violence by rebel movements seeking to undermine legitimate governments.   key points    The KPCS currently has 54 members representing 81 countries. The EU acts as a single participant and has the  Service for Foreign Policy Instruments  (FPI), a department of the  European Commission  , as its competent authority.   The Commission coordinates and monitors the implementation of Kimberley Process rules within the EU.   In order for a rough diamond shipment to be  imported  into the EU and Greenland, it must be transported in a tamper-resistant container and accompanied by a forgery-proof government-validated Kimberley Process certificate from the exporting country.  If those conditions are fulfilled  , the EU authority in the country will provide a confirmed certificate to the importer;  if not fulfilled  , the shipment will be detained.   In order for a rough diamond shipment to be  exported  from the EU and Greenland, it must be transported in a tamper-resistant container and accompanied by a forgery-proof certificate from the EU authority of the exporting country.   The competent authorities within EU countries must report monthly to the Commission and FPI on the import and export certificates issued and validated by them.   Rough diamond traders (listed in Annex V of this regulation) must ensure that they only sell diamonds purchased from legitimate sources not involved in funding conflict. They must guarantee in writing that the diamonds are conflict-free based on personal knowledge and/or written guarantees provided by the diamond suppliers.   from when does the regulation apply  It applies from 31 December 2002.  However, certain articles of this regulation dealing with the import/export regimes and transit apply from 1 February 2003.   background   The trade in conflict diamonds  *  is a matter of serious international concern, which can be directly linked to the fuelling of armed conflict, the activities of rebel movements aimed at undermining or overthrowing legitimate governments and the illicit traffic in, and proliferation of, armaments, especially small arms and light weapons.  The KPCS was developed after countries met in Kimberley, South Africa, in 2000 to explore ways to tackle the growing problems stemming from conflict diamonds.

   Road safety: cross-border application of the legislation     Road safety: cross-border application of the legislation     The European Union is implementing policy intended to improve road safety and reduce the number of fatalities and injuries on roads. The application of sanctions is an important instrument with which to attain this goal but sanctions are often not enforced when offences are committed with a vehicle registered in a different Member State to the one where the offence is committed. A system for exchange of information will help facilitate cross-border enforcement of sanctions against the most dangerous traffic offences.     ACT     Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council facilitating cross-border enforcement in the field of road safety [       COM(2008) 151      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Traffic offences committed in a Member State with a vehicle registered in another Member State often go unpunished. Bilateral agreements have been signed by several Member States to put an end to this impunity but these agreements have proved difficult to implement. Failure to enforce sanctions against non-resident offenders renders road safety policy carried out at the Member State level less effective and discriminates against resident drivers.     The objective of this proposal is to facilitate enforcement against drivers who commit an offence in a Member State different to the one where the vehicle is registered.     The proposal calls for the creation of an electronic data exchange system across all European Union countries which would allow the authorities of a Member State where a traffic offence has been committed to identify the offender and notify them of the sanction resulting from that offence.      Scope      The directive concerns offences:      which cause the greatest number of accidents and deaths on the roads (speeding         *        , not wearing a seat belt         *        , failing to stop at a red light         *        , driving under the influence of alcohol         *        )       for which the sanction concerned is or includes a financial penalty.       System for exchange of information      When an offence has been committed in a Member State with a vehicle registered in another Member State and the offender cannot be sanctioned by the authorities in charge of pursuing offences in the State of offence, the competent authority in that State shall send the vehicle registration number and information concerning the date and place of the offence to the competent authority in the State where the offender resides.     The competent authority in the State of residence       *      sends information pertaining to the vehicle and to the holder of the vehicle registration certificate to the competent authority in the State of offence       *      .      Offence notification      Upon receipt of this information, the competent authority in the State of offence sends an offence notification to the holder of the vehicle registration certificate. This notification contains the details of the offence and the amount of the financial penalty which is due, as well as the possibilities for contestation and appeal. The offence notification is written in the official language or languages of the State of residence.      Central authorities      Each Member State shall designate a central authority to assist with the application of this Directive. Any person whose personal data are transmitted using this system may request to access data, obtain the correction of any inaccurate personal data or the deletion of any data recorded unlawfully from the central authority of the State of residence.      Context      Launched in 2003, the European Road Safety Action Programme aims to halve the number of people killed on roads by 2010. In 2001, 54 000 people died on the roads of the 27 Member States. Between 2001 and 2007, the number of deaths decreased by 20%. While the number of road deaths fell by 6% in 2004 and 5% in 2006, it did not decrease in 2007, during which year 43 000 deaths occurred. The present proposal for a directive aims to encourage drivers to adopt better habits through a stricter observance of existing legislation.       Key terms of the act         State of offence: the Member State where the offence has been committed.         State of residence: Member State where the vehicle with which the offence has been committed is registered.         Speeding: exceeding speed limits in force in the State of offence for the road or type of vehicle concerned.         Drink-driving: driving with a blood alcohol level higher than the maximum level in force in the State of offence.         Non-use of a seat belt: failure to comply with the requirement to wear a seat belt or use a child restraint in accordance with Council Directive 91/671/ECC and with the national law in the State of offence.         Failure to stop at a red traffic light: the offence of driving through a red traffic light as it is defined in the law of the State of offence.

act   Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Central Bank, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and the European Investment Bank: An investment plan for Europe (  COM(2014) 903 final  of 26.11.2014).   summary    background   The communication sets out an investment plan to serve three policy objectives:   reverse downward investment trends and help boost job creation and economic recovery, without weighing on national public finances or creating new debt;   move towards meeting the long-term needs of the EU economy and increase competitiveness;   strengthen the European dimension of human capital, productive capacity, knowledge and physical infrastructure, with a special focus on aspects vital to the EU’s single market.   what will the plan do   Mobilise at least €315 billion in additional investment over 3 years, maximising the impact of public resources and unlocking private investment.   Target initiatives to ensure that this extra investment meets the needs of the real economy.   Put in place measures to provide simpler, better and more predictable regulation, in particular removing obstacles to growth.   Reinforce the level-playing field and remove barriers to investment in the single market.   Open up new sources of long-term financing.   key points   A new European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) is being set up in partnership between the European Commission and the  European Investment Bank  (EIB).  Initially, the EU budget will guarantee €16 billion, and the EIB will commit €5 billion. EU countries and private companies have the opportunity to contribute, with every €1 billion of funding resulting in at least €20 billion of capital.  A pipeline of projects will be established at EU level, and an investment advisory ‘hub’ will be set up to bring together expertise and strengthen technical assistance at all levels. The Commission will engage with investors, project promoters and institutional stakeholders to facilitate key investment projects and make sure projects access appropriate sources of funding.

   Disposal of titanium dioxide industrial waste     Disposal of titanium dioxide industrial waste     This directive aims to prevent, gradually reduce and ultimately eliminate pollution from titanium dioxide industrial waste.     ACT     Council Directive       78/176/EEC      of 20 February 1978 on titanium dioxide industrial waste [       See amending act(s      )].     SUMMARY     The Member States will take steps to ensure that waste-disposal procedures take due account of human-health and environmental considerations. They will actively encourage waste prevention and recycling and the re-use of waste as raw materials.     Any discharge, dumping, storage, accumulation or injection of waste will require prior authorization, for a limited but renewable period, by the competent Member State authority:      on whose territory the waste is produced;       on whose territory the waste is discharged or dumped;       from whose territory the waste is discharged or dumped.      Periodical checks will be carried out on the waste, and on the ambient environment in question, by bodies designated by the Member State responsible for issuing the licence, with a view to assessing the physical, chemical, biological and ecological aspects.     The Member States will draw up programmes for the gradual reduction, and ultimate elimination, of pollution caused by waste from old manufacturing facilities.     In the case of new manufacturing facilities, prior authorization must be obtained from the competent authorities in the Member State on whose territory it is planned to construct them. The issuing of any such authorization will be preceded by environmental impact studies and will be conditional on an undertaking by the companies concerned to use only those materials, procedures and technology that are least damaging to the environment.     Under the terms of the Directive, Member States are empowered to introduce more stringent rules.

   Ensuring the safety and performance of medical devices     Ensuring the safety and performance of medical devices     SUMMARY OF:      Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices      WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?      It updates the rules on placing on the EU market, making available and putting into service         medical devices         *         for human use and their accessories        .       It also contains rules on how clinical investigations         *        concerning such devices and accessories are carried out in the EU.       It aims to improve         patient safety        by introducing more stringent procedures for         conformity assessment        (to ensure that unsafe or non-compliant devices do not end up on the market) and         post-market surveillance        .       Amending Regulation (EU)         2020/561        was adopted to allow EU countries and their authorities and institutions to give priority to the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. To ensure the smooth functioning of the EU’s         internal market        , to maintain a high level of protection of         public health        and patient safety, to provide legal certainty and to avoid potential market disruption during the COVID-19 health crisis, it defers the application of certain rules of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 by 1 year.      KEY POINTS      Scope      Besides the variety of medical devices, the regulation also covers certain groups of products which do not have an intended medical purpose. These include coloured contact lenses (i.e. lenses that do not correct vision) and equipment for liposuction. For more details about the list of those groups of products, see Annex XVI to the regulation.      Classification      Medical devices are classified according to their intended purpose and their inherent risks (classes I, IIa, IIb and III — for more details, see Annex VIII to the regulation).      Notified bodies       The regulation tightens the rules concerning how the independent          notified bodies         — which assess the conformity of medium- and high-risk medical devices before they are placed on the market — are designated, organised and monitored.       These bodies have to meet the same high-quality standards throughout the EU and must have the required competences, resources and staff to successfully perform their conformity assessment tasks.       On-site inspections of manufacturers, of which some are unannounced, must be carried out.       Assessments of certain high-risk devices (e.g. implants) might also involve EU-level panels of independent experts (          expert panels         ).       Clinical data       The regulation specifies what is required in the data collection of clinical investigations on medical devices. These requirements have been to a large extent aligned with those applicable for clinical trials on medicinal products. They include rules on informed consent and protecting vulnerable subjects (e.g. people under the age of 18, pregnant women or the incapacitated).       Clinical investigations conducted in more than 1 EU country will be subject to a         single coordinated assessment        .       Manufacturers’ and other economic operators’ obligations       Manufacturers have clearer and more stringent obligations to monitor the quality, performance and safety of devices.       They must ensure they have sufficient financial coverage with respect to their potential liability under Directive         85/374/EEC        on product liability (see         summary        ) and the related measures must be proportionate to the risk class, the type of device and the size of the enterprise.       Manufacturers have to put in place         quality management and post-market surveillance systems        proportionate to the risk class and the type of device.       In the event of damages due to a defective device, a manufacturer’s authorised representative is jointly and severally liable.       Where         hazardous substances        , which are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction or which can interfere with endocrine systems, are contained in         invasive medical devices beyond a certain threshold        , manufacturers must provide a justification to the notified body regarding their presence.       Specific obligations are also established for the other economic operators: authorised representatives, importers, distributors and those dealing with systems and procedure packs.       Traceability      The regulation introduces a system for registering devices and manufacturers, importers and authorised representatives to ensure the traceability of devices throughout the supply chain by means of a        unique device identifier       (UDI)       system      . This will ensure that, if problems arise, measures can be taken more rapidly.      Single-use devices      These devices may only be reprocessed (cleaned, disinfected, tested, restored for technical and functional safety and sterilised) if permitted under national law and if they meet certain conditions laid down in this regulation. The manufacturer is responsible for the       reprocessing      of the single-use device and assumes the obligations of a manufacturer. In certain cases, EU countries may allow for exceptions to the general rules where the single-use device is reprocessed and used within a health institution, provided that certain specific requirements laid down in the regulation are fulfilled.      Incident reporting      In addition to the obligation for manufacturers to report serious incidents and trends in non-serious incidents, the regulation introduces obligations for EU countries to encourage and enable healthcare professionals, users and patients to report suspected incidents at national level using harmonised formats.      Market surveillance      EU competent authorities are responsible for ensuring that any unsafe or non-compliant device is not placed on (or is withdrawn from) the market.      Eudamed      A centralised system, called the       European database on medical devices      (Eudamed) will be developed to provide EU countries, economic operators, patients, healthcare professionals and the public with information on medical devices available in the EU.      Implant card      In the case of       implantable devices      , manufacturers must provide patients with key information on an       implant card      delivered with the device. This includes:      the identification of the device, its name, serial number, lot number, the UDI and the manufacturer’s details;       measures or precautions to be taken concerning reciprocal interference with ‘reasonably foreseeable external influences’, medical examinations or environmental conditions;       the expected lifetime of the device and any necessary follow-up.       Repeal of existing legislation — Directives 90/385/EEC and 93/42/EEC      The regulation, as amended by Regulation (EU) 2020/561, postpones the repeal of Directives       90/385/EEC      and       93/42/EEC      by 1 year to 26 May 2021, with specific transitional provisions and some exceptions laid down in Articles 120 and 122.     FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?     It entered into force on 25 May 2017 and, further to amending Regulation (EU) 2020/561, will apply from 26 May 2021, 1 year later than originally intended. However, the dates of application for some of the regulation’s rules vary and are detailed in Articles 120, 122 and 123, as amended.     BACKGROUND      This regulation is one of two adopted by the EU to overhaul its laws on medical devices. The second regulation (Regulation (EU)         2017/746        , see         summary        ) concerns          in vitro         diagnostic medical devices.       For more information, see:           Medical devices            (             European Commission            ).        KEY TERMS      Medical device:      term covering a wide variety of products used, for instance, for: diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, prognosis, treatment or alleviation of diseases, injuries or disabilities; investigation, replacement or modification of the anatomy or of a physiological or pathological process or state; control or support for conception; support or sustaining of life, etc. It does not achieve its principal intended action by pharmacological, immunological or metabolic means, but the latter may assist in its function. Examples range from bandages through hip replacements to pacemakers.       The complete definition of the term ‘medical device’ is laid down in Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) 2017/745.       Clinical investigation:      any systematic investigation involving one or more human subjects, undertaken to assess the safety or performance of a device.

SUMMARY     At the Laeken European Council, the Member States undertook to step up cooperation between departments specialising in counter terrorism and to find a common definition of terrorist crimes (cf. point 17 of the Conclusions). In June 2002, the Council adopted a framework decision designed to approximate legislative provisions establishing minimum rules at European level relating to the       constituent elements      of offences and penalties in the field of terrorism.     In addition, it is necessary to improve the       Schengen Information System's      operational capacity so as to facilitate effective cooperation with other agencies, such as       Europol      and       Eurojust      , which will be authorised under these measures to access a limited number of categories of SIS data.     The Regulation and Decision discussed here were adopted on a Spanish initiative and aim to improve the operation of SIS-I as a useful instrument in combating illegal immigration, crime and terrorism by introducing new functions.     At present, the       SIS      allows the competent authorities of the Member States to access data on certain categories of persons and objects. As such, it is vital to the smooth operation of the area of security, freedom and justice. It helps to implement the provisions concerning free movement of persons (Title IV of the EC Treaty) and those concerning police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters (Title VI of the EU Treaty).     Cf. Article 93 of the 1990 Schengen Convention states that the purpose of the SIS is to maintain public order and security, including state security, and to apply the provisions of this Convention relating to the movement of persons.     Since certain provisions of the 1990 Schengen Convention serve both purposes, they have to be amended in identical terms by parallel instruments based on each of the two Treaties. The amendments to the Schengen       acquis      required for that purpose come in two forms:      the Regulation, based on Articles 62, 63 and 66 of the EC Treaty;       the Decision, based on Articles 30(1)(a) and (b), 31(a) and (b) and 34(2)(c) of the EU Treaty.      These initiatives are without prejudice to the future development of a second generation Schengen Information System, referred to as " SIS II ", which will be set up with a view to enlargement and will provide for major innovations in information technology.     The main amendments made to the SIS by the Regulation and the Decision concern:      access for Europol and the national members of Eurojust to the data stored in the SIS;       extending the list of missing objects for which alerts can be entered - boats, aircraft, containers, residence permits, registration certificates, etc. (category added by Regulation No         1160/2005        ) and means of payment.      So as to provide the authorities designated to exchange any additional information with a legal basis and to establish rules applicable to deletion of data held by them, other amendments relate to:      access to the SIS for the national judicial authorities responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime;       the obligation for the Member States to record all transmissions of personal data (in place of the current rule requiring one transmission in ten to be recorded) and extending the period for which records must be kept to up to three years;       determination of a common legal basis for the existence and operation of SIRENE (Supplementary Information Request at National Entry) offices - the SIRENE network.

   Release of N-nitrosamines from rubber teats     Release of N-nitrosamines from rubber teats     Community legislation is harmonising the provisions relating to the release of N-nitrosamines and N-nitrosable substances from elastomer or rubber teats and soothers.     ACT     Commission Directive       93/11/EEC      of 15 March 1993 concerning the release of N-nitrosamines and N-nitrosatable substances from elastomer or rubber teats and soothers.     SUMMARY     This Directive is a       specific       measure      within the meaning of Article 5 of       Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004      on materials and articles intended to come into contact with food.      Elastomer or rubber teats and soothers      are capable of releasing       N-nitrosamines      and       N-nitrosable substances      (substances likely to be transformed into N-nitrosamines) which, by virtue of their toxicity, pose a threat to human health.     Accordingly, the       migration of substances must not exceed the following limits      :      0.01 mg of the total quantity of N-nitrosamines released per kg (parts of elastomer or rubber teats and soothers)       0.1 mg of the total quantity of N-nitrosatable substances (parts of elastomer or rubber teats and soothers).      These       limits must be checked      by means of a test, subject to the conditions set out in the annex to this Directive. The analytical method to be employed is also laid down in this annex.     Teats and soothers which do not comply with this Directive are       prohibited from 1 April 1995.

summary of   Information to accompany money transfers — Regulation (EU) 2015/847   summary    what does this regulation do  It sets out rules on the information on payers* and payees*, accompanying transfers of funds*, in order to help prevent, detect and investigate  money laundering  * and terrorist financing*.  EU rules in this area are largely based on  international recommendations  adopted by the  Financial Action Task Force  (FATF*).   key points   As regards  scope  , the regulation applies to transfers of funds, in any currency, sent or received by a payment service provider (PSP)* or an intermediary PSP* established in the EU.  The PSP of the  payer  is required to provide specific information on both payer and payee, for example, the name of the payee and the payee’s payment account number and to check the accuracy of the information provided.  The PSP of the  payee  and any  intermediary PSP  are required to have effective procedures in place for detecting whether the information provided on payer or payee is  missing or incomplete  . In the case of missing or incomplete information, the PSPs must have effective risk-based procedures for deciding whether to  execute, reject or suspend a transfer of funds  lacking the required information.   Personal data  obtained by PSPs should be used only for the purpose of preventing money laundering and terrorist financing, and PSPs should ensure the confidentiality of such data.  Any  record  of information on payer/payee should not be kept longer than is necessary for the purposes of preventing, detecting and investigating money laundering and terrorist financing. That period should be limited to 5 years, after which all personal data should be deleted unless national law provides otherwise.  EU countries are required to establish effective, proportionate and dissuasive  sanctions  for breach of this Regulation.  The regulation is part of a  package  of EU legislative measures aimed at preventing money laundering and terrorist financing, including  Directive 2015/849  on preventing the use of the financial system for money laundering or terrorist financing (fourth anti-money laundering directive).  The regulation is part of a broad EU strategy to tackle financial crime that also includes the work of:        —     an  Expert group on Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing  which meets regularly to exchange views and assist the Commission in the preparation of legislation or in policy definition,            —     a Committee on the Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing which may provide opinions on implementing measures proposed by the Commission,            —     an informal network of  financial intelligence units (the EU FIUs Platform)  ,            —     the  Joint Committee of European Supervisory Authorities.       when does this regulation apply  From 26 June 2017. It repeals  Regulation (EC) No 1781/2006  .   background         —      Financial crime             —      Terrorist financing       key terms    * Payer  : a natural or legal person who is the account holder and who allows a transfer of funds to leave that account, or in the absence of an account, the natural or legal person who gives the order to carry out a transfer of funds.   * Payee  : a natural or legal person who is the intended final recipient of transferred funds.   * Transfer of funds  : any transaction carried out on behalf of a payer through a payment service provider by electronic means with a view to making funds available to a payee at another payment service provider, irrespective of whether the payer and the payee are the same person.   * Money laundering  : the conversion of the proceeds of crime into apparently clean funds, usually via the financial system. This may be achieved for instance by disguising the sources of the money, changing its form, or moving the funds to a place where they are less likely to attract attention   * Terrorist financing  is the provision or collection of funds intended to be used to carry out terrorist offences   * FAFT  : the intergovernmental body responsible for designing and promoting, at both national and international level, strategies to combat money laundering and terrorism financing.   * Payment service provider (PSP)  : a natural or legal person whose business includes the provision of fund transfer services.   * Intermediary payment service provider  : a payment service provider which is neither that of the payer nor that of the payee and which participates in the execution of transfers of funds.   act   Regulation (EU)  2015/847  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on information accompanying transfers of funds and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1781/2006   REFERENCES           Act     Entry into force     Deadline for transposition in the Member States     Official Journal       Regulation (EU)  2015/847      25.6.2015     —      OJ L 141, 5.6.2015, pp. 1–18
summary of   Directive 2005/44/EC on harmonised river information services (RIS) on the EU’s inland waterways   what does this directive do  It establishes rules on the use of harmonised river information services (RIS)*. These rules are designed to ensure the safety, efficiency and environmental friendliness of inland waterways in the EU. They apply to canals, rivers, lakes and ports able to take vessels between 1,000 and 1,500 tonnes.   key points    River information services include:   geographical, hydrological and administrative data on waterways (‘fairway information’);   data relevant to navigation in the short, medium and long term (‘tactical and strategic traffic information’);   action in the event of an accident (‘calamity abatement support’);   statistics, customs services, waterway charges and port dues.     EU countries must:   ensure their RIS are efficient, allow for expansion and can coordinate with other systems;   supply all RIS users with the relevant data on navigational and voyage planning;   establish RIS centres according to regional needs;   designate authorities to oversee RIS application and the exchange of international data.     The  European Commission  is responsible for setting out, by agreed deadlines, the technical guidelines for the planning, implementation and operational use of RIS. These include:   an electronic chart display and information system;   electronic ship reporting;   notices to skippers;   vessel tracking and tracing systems;   compatibility of RIS equipment.     The Commission, assisted by a committee of national experts, has developed RIS technical requirements.    Action programme   In 2006, the Commission presented a communication on an  integrated EU action programme for inland waterway transport  . Known as Naiades (Navigation and inland waterway action and development in Europe), the programme was updated in 2013 (Naiades II) and set out specific objectives up to 2020. The Commission’s Naiades II  communication  aims to create the conditions for inland navigation transport to become a quality mode of transport.   from when does the directive apply  It entered into force on 20 October 2005. EU countries had to incorporate it in their national law by 20 October 2007.   background    The EU has over 37,000 km of canals and rivers linking key towns and economic areas. These inland waterways make a major contribution to a sustainable transport system, reducing congestion and pollution on the EU's roads.    River Information Services portal    key terms    * River information services (RIS)  : these support inland navigation traffic and transport management and, where feasible, coordination with other forms of transport.   act   Directive  2005/44/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on harmonised river information services (RIS) on inland waterways in the Community (OJ L 255, 30.9.2005, pp. 152–159)  Successive amendments and corrections to Directive 2005/44/EC have been incorporated in the basic text.

summary of   Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 with regard to liquidity coverage requirement for Credit Institutions   what is the aim of the regulation  This  delegated  regulation sets out in detail how to apply the general principle introduced in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the  Capital Requirements Regulation  , that credit institutions must have enough funds to meet withdrawal demands over a 30-day period.  Known as the  LCR  (liquidity coverage ratio)  delegated regulation  , it specifies which assets are to be considered as  liquid assets   *  . It sets out how expected cash outflows and inflows over a 30-day period should be calculated.   key points   Credit institutions must maintain a liquidity coverage ratio of at least 100%. This is equal to the ratio between its  liquidity buffer   *  and  net liquidity outflows   *  over 30 days.  A credit institution is under  stress   *  in the following situations (non-exhaustive list):   run-off of a significant amount of its retail deposits;   partial or total loss of its unsecured wholesale funding capacity or its secured short-term funding;   additional liquidity outflows from credit rating downgrade;   impact of increased market volatility on the value of its collateral;   unscheduled drawing on its liquidity and credit facilities;   potential obligation to buy back debt or honour non-contractual obligations.    Liquid assets  must:   be a property, right, entitlement or interest, held by a credit institution, that may provide cash within 30 days;   not be issued by the credit institution itself or by other bodies such as investment firms, insurance undertakings or financial holding companies;   be able to have their value determined on the basis of easily available market prices;   be listed on a recognised exchange, or tradable by a direct sale or simple  repurchase agreement   *  ;   Liquid assets are divided into various  categories  :    Level 1  (the most liquid), such as coins and banknotes or assets guaranteed by the  European Central Bank  , national central banks or regional governments and local authorities;    Level 2A  , such as assets guaranteed by regional governments, local authorities or public sector bodies in the EU with a weighted risk of 20%;    Level 2B  , such as asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, shares provided they meet certain requirements and certain  securitisations   *  which must satisfy a range of strict conditions to be accepted as a Level 2B asset.    Credit institutions  must ensure:   the assets in their liquidity buffer are always sufficiently diversified, readily accessible and can be turned into cash within 30 days;   they hold a minimum of 60% of the buffer in level 1 assets and a maximum of 15% in level 2B assets;   within 30 days, they do not treat as liquid assets those that no longer meet the criteria.   Detailed rules and calculations are used to determine and measure liquidity outflows and inflows and the procedures to be taken.  Commission Delegated Regulation (EU)  2018/1620  made certain amendments to the 2015 legislation to improve its practical application. The most important are:   align fully the calculation of expected liquidity outflows and inflows on repurchase agreements,  reverse repurchase agreements   *  and  collateral swap transactions   *  with the  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision  ’s international liquidity standard;   specify the treatment of central banks’ reserves held by subsidiaries or branches;   adjust the waiver of the minimum issue size for certain non-EU-country assets;   improve the  unwind mechanism   *  for calculating the liquid buffer;   integrate the new simple, transparent and standardised criteria for securitisation.   Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/1620 applies from 30 April 2020.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 1 October 2015.   background   For more information, see:    Prudential requirements  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Liquid asset:  an asset that can be easily converted into cash.   Liquidity buffer:  amount of liquid assets a credit institution holds.   Net liquidity outflows:  amount that remains after subtracting incoming from outgoing cash.   Stress:  sudden or severe deterioration in a credit institution’s solvency or liquidity.   Repurchase agreement:  also known as ‘repo’, this is a short-term loan whereby the seller of the security agrees to buy it back at a specified price and time.   Securitisation:  a procedure where various financial assets or contractual debts, such as car loans or mortgages, are repackaged and sold to investors.   Reverse repurchase agreements:  also known as 'reverse repo', purchase of securities with agreement to sell them at a higher price at a specific future date.   Collateral swap transactions:  loan of liquid assets in return for less liquid collateral. The borrower pays a fee to the lender for the risks involved.   Unwind mechanism:  closing down of transactions (such as repurchase or reverse repurchase transactions) which mature in the next 30 days.
summary of   Regulation (EU) No 524/2013 on online dispute resolution for consumer disputes   what is the aim of the regulation   It aims to create an  online dispute resolution (ODR) platform  (website) at EU level.   Consumers and traders will be able to use the platform to resolve disputes when they have a problem with a product or service that they have bought anywhere in the European Union (EU).   key points   The complaint procedure involves both parties and the  mediationbody  (alternative dispute resolution (ADR)) they agree to use. These bodies — some of which operate online — offer a neutral party such as an ombudsman or mediator. Their job is to propose or impose a solution or to bring the parties together so they can find a solution.  The entire procedure can be handled quickly online, so most disputes should be settled within 90 days.   ODR platform   The European Commission will develop, operate and maintain the ODR platform. It will be launched in January 2016 and will be:    an interactive and user-friendly website  ;    open to any customer or trader in the EU  ;    available in all EU official languages;     free of charge.    The platform has several functions. These include offering an electronic complaint form, informing the respondent party about the complaint, identifying national mediation bodies and electronic case management.  Each EU country must designate one ODR contact point, hosting at least two ODR advisers. The Commission will also set up a  network of ODR contact points  .  Once the electronic complaint form has been submitted to the ODR platform, the platform will quickly contact and seek a response from the respondent party. It will also transmit the complaint to the mediation body that the parties agree to use. If the mediation body agrees to deal with the dispute, it will strive to resolve the dispute quickly and inform the ODR platform of the results of the procedure.   Alternative dispute resolution   The ODR platform can be accessed through the  Your Europe  portal. It will also be connected to all the national mediation bodies that have been set up and notified to the European Commission, in line with the EU  alternative dispute resolution (ADR) directive  .  The ODR regulation and ADR directive were both adopted in May 2013.  The ODR platform is accessible to consumers and traders since 15 February 2016.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 9 January 2016.   background   For more information, see:    Alternative and Online Dispute Resolution (ADR/ODR)  on the European Commission’s website    Consumer dispute resolution  on the Your Europe website.
summary of   Directive (EU) 2019/944 on common rules for the internal market for electricity   what is the aim of the directive   It outlines rules for the generation, transmission, distribution, supply and storage of electricity, together with consumer protection aspects, aiming to create integrated competitive, consumer-centred, flexible, fair and transparent electricity markets in the EU.   Among other things, it contains rules on retail markets for electricity, whereas Regulation (EU) 2019/943, which was adopted at the same time, mainly contains rules on the  wholesale market and network operation  .   It repeals Directive  2009/72/EC  (see summary  Internal market in electricity  ) as of 1 January 2021.   key points    Customer rights   The directive clarifies and reinforces existing customer rights and introduces new ones:   right to freely choose a supplier and restrictions on switching and exit fees, except where fixed-price fixed-term contracts are terminated before their end date;   right to access to at least one price comparison tool fulfilling certain trust requirements; compliant privately run tools may be issued a trust mark;   right to join a citizen energy community while retaining full consumer rights, including the right to leave the community without penalties;   right to a dynamic price contract (based on prices in the spot or day-ahead market) from at least one supplier and every supplier with more than 200,000 customers, and right to be provided information about the opportunities and risks involved;   right to an aggregation contract independent of electricity supply;   right to produce, consume, store and sell electricity, individually or through an aggregator  *  ;   right to request the installation of a smart meter within 4 months, while EU countries must ensure a roll-out of smart metering systems, except where it is not yet considered cost-effective;   right of energy-poor or vulnerable customers to targeted protection, but with regulated price-setting only allowed under certain conditions;   right of customers facing disconnection to be given information about alternatives, such as payment plans or a moratorium, well in advance.    Billing    Bills should be clear, correct, concise and presented in a way that makes comparisons easy.   Billing information should be provided at least every 6 months or once every 3 months, if requested, or, where the final customer has opted to receive electronic billing, and at least once a month if meters can be read remotely.    Aggregators   EU countries must:   ensure that aggregators can offer aggregation contracts to customers without those customers having to obtain the consent of their supplier;   ensure the fair participation of aggregators in all electricity markets and that transmission and distribution system operators treat aggregators equally with other market participants, including when they procure services;   establish transparent rules assigning roles and responsibilities to all market participants and set out rules for data exchange between market participants;   establish rules for compensation between aggregators and suppliers where the activation of demand response causes an imbalance; such compensation shall strictly cover resulting costs and the calculation of such compensation may take into account the systemic benefits of demand response.    Citizen energy communities    are shareholder- or member-controlled entities based on voluntary and open participation, which have the right to engage in generation, distribution, supply, consumption, energy efficiency services or charging services for electric vehicles, or provide other energy services to its members or shareholders;   have the right to be connected to distribution grids and be treated in a non-discriminatory manner in terms of regulation or access to all electricity markets;   have the right to share their own electricity production with their members in accordance with a cost-benefit analysis of distributed energy resources;   have the right, where so permitted by the EU country in question, to own, establish, purchase or lease distribution networks subject to the applicable regulations.    Access to data and interoperability    The directive updates rules on access to metering and consumption/generation data by network operators, consumers, suppliers and service providers. Moreover, it envisages that the  European Commission  will set up in secondary law interoperability rules to facilitate the exchange of data.   Data managers must ensure non-discriminatory access to data from smart metering systems while complying with the data protection rules.    Electromobility    EU countries must establish a regulatory framework to facilitate the connection of electric vehicle recharging points to the distribution network.   Distribution system operators  *  (DSOs) would only be allowed to own, develop, manage or operate recharging points if no other body has expressed interest in an open tendering procedure, subject to regulatory approval and in line with third-party access rules.    Distribution system operators (DSOs):    are responsible for ensuring the long-term ability of the system to meet demands for the distribution of electricity, including the cost-efficient integration of new electricity generation installations and especially the ones which produce electricity from renewable sources, as well as for providing system users with the information needed for efficient access and use of the system;   must publish network development plans setting out the planned investments for the following 5 to 10 years;   where part of a vertically integrated undertaking, must be independent at least in terms of its legal form, organisation and decision-making from other activities not relating to distribution;   are not allowed to own, develop, manage or operate storage facilities except where certain specific conditions are met.    Transmission system operators   *  (TSOs)  :    must ensure the long-term ability of the system to meet demands for the transmission of electricity, in close cooperation with neighbouring TSOs and DSOs.   shall manage the secure operation of the system including keeping the balance between electricity supply and demand.   are not allowed to own, develop, manage or operate energy storage facilities, under similar conditions as apply to DSOs.    National energy regulators:    must cooperate with neighbouring regulators and with the  Agency for cooperation between EU energy regulators  on issues including  risk-preparedness  , allocation of cross-border capacity and to ensure an adequate level of  interconnector capacities  .   have revised oversight responsibility for regional operating centres and other entities at regional level.    Clean energy   This directive is part of the  Clean Energy for all Europeans package  .   from when does the directive apply  It applies from 1 January 2021.  Directive (EU) 2019/944  revises  and replaces Directive  2009/72/EC  and has to become law in the EU countries by 31 December 2020.  The original Directive 2009/72/EC had to become law in the EU countries by 2011.   background   For more information, see:    Energy union for Europe  (  European Council  )    Clean energy for all Europeans  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Aggregator:  a natural or legal person who combines multiple customer loads or generated electricity for sale, purchase or auction in any electricity market.   Distribution system operator:  a natural or legal person responsible for operating and developing the electricity distribution system in an area, and its interconnections with other systems, and for ensuring the long-term ability of the system to meet reasonable demands for the distribution of electricity.   Transmission system operator:  a natural or legal person who is responsible for operating and developing the electricity transmission system in an area, and its interconnections with other systems, and for ensuring the long-term ability of the system to meet reasonable demands for the transmission of electricity.
act   Council Directive  2001/110/EC  of 20 December 2001 relating to honey.   summary    what does this directive do  Besides rules on the composition and definition of honey, it specifies the types of honey products which can be sold under given names and rules on labelling, presentation and information on origin.   key points   The directive supplements the general EU rules on food labelling set down in  Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011  . Essential consumer information must be included on labels and, in particular, labels must include the country of origin of the honey and the product names, as set out in Annex I.   Definition   Honey is a natural sweet substance produced by  Apis mellifera  bees from the nectar of plants or from secretions of living parts of plants or excretions of plant-sucking insects on plants. Bees collect it, transform it by combining with specific substances of their own, deposit it, dehydrate it, store it and leave it in honeycombs to ripen and mature.   Composition   When commercialised as honey or used in a product intended for human consumption, honey must meet the composition criteria set out in the directive’s Annex II.  Directive  2014/63/EU  clarifies that pollen is a natural constituent rather than an ingredient of honey.   Labels   Directive 2014/63/EU also clarifies the labelling requirements where honey originates in more than one EU country or a non-EU country. In these cases, the indicator of the country of origin may be replaced by one of the following indications, as appropriate:   ‘blend of EU honeys’;   ‘blend of non-EU honeys’,   ‘blend of EU and non-EU honeys’.   In certain cases, these names may be replaced by the simple product name ‘honey’ (except in the case of ‘filtered honey’*, ‘comb honey’** ‘chunk honey or cut comb in honey’*** or ‘baker's honey’****).  Information on regional, territorial or topographical origin, on floral or vegetable origin or on specific quality criteria may supplement this labelling (except for ‘filtered honey’ and ‘baker's honey’).  Directive 2014/63/EU allows the European Commission to adopt further laws (delegated acts) laying down two parameters for the criterion of ‘mainly’ as regards the floral or vegetable origin of honey and the minimal content of pollen in filtered honey following removal of foreign inorganic or organic matter.   when does this directive apply  Directive 2001/110/EC applies from 1 February 2002. Directive 2014/63/EU applies from 23 June 2014. Honeys for sale or labelled before 24 June 2015 may continue to be marketed until the exhaustion of stocks.   key terms    * Filtered honey  : honey obtained by removing foreign inorganic or organic matter in such a way as to result in the significant removal of pollen.   ** Comb honey  : honey stored by bees in the cells combs or thin comb foundation sheets made solely of beeswax and sold in sealed whole combs or sections of such combs.   *** Chunk honey or cut comb in honey  : honey which contains one or more pieces of comb honey.   **** Baker’s honey  : the words ‘intended for cooking only’ must appear on the label in close proximity to the product name.

   Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution     Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution     The European Union sets objectives for reducing certain pollutants and reinforces the legislative framework for combating air pollution via two main routes: improving Community environmental legislation and integrating air quality concerns into related policies.     ACT     Communication of 21 September 2005 from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament - Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution [       COM(2005) 446      - Not published in the Official Journal]     SUMMARY     In order to attain "levels of air quality that do not give rise to significant negative impacts on, and risks to human health and environment", this Thematic Strategy supplements the current legislation. It establishes objectives for air pollution and proposes measures for achieving them by 2020: modernising the existing legislation, placing the emphasis on the most harmful pollutants, and involving to a greater extent the sectors and policies that may have an impact on air pollution.      Air Pollution      Air pollution seriously damages human health and the environment: respiratory problems, premature deaths, eutrophication       *      and damage to ecosystems as a result of the deposition of nitrogen and acidic substances are some of the consequences of this problem which is both local and transfrontier in nature.     The pollutants causing the greatest concern where public health is concerned are tropospheric ozone       *      and especially particulate matter       *      (in particular fine particles or PM2.5).      The objectives of the Strategy      The Strategy chosen sets health and environmental objectives and emission reduction targets for the main pollutants. These objectives will be delivered in stages, and will make it possible to protect EU citizens from exposure to particulate matter and ozone in air, and protect European ecosystems more effectively from acid rain, excess nutrient nitrogen, and ozone     When drawing up the Strategy, it was impossible to determine a level of exposure to particulate matter and tropospheric ozone that does not constitute a danger to human beings. However, a significant reduction in these substances will have beneficial effects in terms of public health, and will also generate benefits for ecosystems.     Compared with the situation in 2000, the Strategy sets specific long-term objectives (for 2020):      47% reduction in loss of life expectancy as a result of exposure to particulate matter;       10 % reduction in acute mortalities from exposure to ozone;       reduction in excess acid deposition of 74% and 39% in forest areas and surface freshwater areas respectively;       43% reduction in areas or ecosystems exposed to eutrophication.      To achieve these objectives, SO2 emissions will need to decrease by 82%, NOx emissions by 60%, volatile organic compounds       *      (VOCs) by 51%, ammonia by 27%, and primary PM2.5 (particles emitted directly into the air) by 59% compared with the year 2000.     Implementing the Strategy will entail an incremental additional cost compared with spending on existing measures. This additional cost is likely to amount to EUR 7.1 billion per annum from 2020.     In terms of health, the savings that will be made as a result of the Strategy are estimated at EUR 42 billion per annum. The number of premature deaths should fall from 370 000 in 2000 to 230 000 in 2020 (compared with 293 000 in 2020 without the Strategy).     Where the environment is concerned, there is no agreed way to assign a monetary value to ecosystem damage or the likely benefits resulting from the Strategy. However, there should a be a favourable impact as a result of reducing acid rain and nutrient nitrogen inputs, resulting among other things in better protection for biodiversity.      Better European legislation on air quality      One of the crucial aspects in this respect is the simplification of legislation. A proposal to revise the legislation on       air quality      , which provides for merging the Framework Directive, the first, second, and third "Daughter Directives", and the       Exchange of Information Decision      , is therefore attached to the Strategy.     It is proposed that the legislation on       particulate matter      should be supplemented by setting a limit value of 25 g/m³ for fine particles (PM 2.5) and an interim reduction target of 20% to be attained between 2010 and 2020.     The Strategy also makes provision for revising the legislation on national       emission ceilings      , extending, subject to strict conditions, certain deadlines for the implementation of legislative provisions, modernising data communication, and improving coherence with other environmental policies.      Integrating air quality concerns into the sectors concerned      More efficient energy use can help to reduce harmful emissions. The targets set concerning the production of energy and electricity from renewable energy sources (12% and 21% respectively by 2010) and concerning biofuels are major factors in this connection. The Strategy makes provision for possible extension of the       IPPC Directive      and the       Energy Performance of Buildings Directive      to small combustion plants. The establishment of standards for small heating installations is also envisaged through the new       Energy-using Products Directive      . The Strategy also provides for examining how to reduce VOC emissions at filling stations.     Turning to transport, the Strategy envisages new proposals concerning the       reduction of emissions from new passenger cars and vans      , and heavy-duty vehicles. In addition, it envisages improvements in       vehicle approval procedures      and other measures concerning the scope for differentiated charging, and older vehicles.     The Commission is also planning to examine the impact of aviation on climate change in a forthcoming communication. Where shipping is concerned, the Strategy provides for the continuation of negotiations in the context of the International Maritime Organisation, the promotion of shore-side electricity for ships in port, and the consideration of pollution issues in relation to funding through programmes such as       Marco Polo      .     Where agriculture is concerned, the strategy calls for measures to be promoted to reduce the use of nitrogen in animal feedingstuffs and fertilisers. The rules and proposals concerning rural development also provide for possible ways of reducing ammonia emissions from agricultural sources, in particular through farm modernisation. The ongoing reform of the rules relating to the       cohesion instruments      also includes proposals that will help to meet the objectives of the Strategy.     The Strategy also calls for air quality concerns to be taken into account in international forums and bilateral relations.      Background      The Strategy on Air Pollution is one of the seven thematic strategies provided for in the       Sixth Environmental Action Programme      adopted in 2002. It is the first of these strategies to be adopted formally by the Commission.     It is based on research carried under by the       Clean Air For Europe      (CAFE) programme and the successive research framework programmes, and was adopted following a lengthy consultation process involving the European Parliament, Non-Governmental Organisations and industry and private individuals.       Key terms used in the act         Eutrophication: Excess nutrient nitrogen (in the form of ammonia and nitrogen oxides) which disrupts plant communities, and leaches into fresh waters, leading in each case to a loss of biodiversity.         Tropospheric ozone: Ozone which is formed through chemical reactions between volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the presence of sunlight and which accumulates at low altitudes.         Particulate matter: Fine dust emitted by certain human activities (primary particles) or which are formed in the atmosphere (secondary particles) from gases such as sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ammonia (NH3). Particles differ in size: large particles (PM10) are between 2.5 and 10         Volatile organic compounds (VOCs): Carbon-based chemical compounds emitted into the atmosphere from natural sources or as a result of human activities (e.g. the use of solvents, paints and varnishes, the storage of motor fuel and the use of motor fuel in filling stations, and vehicle exhaust gases).

   New skills for new jobs     New skills for new jobs     Europe is facing socio-economic changes which are affecting the structure of the labour market. By adopting a European perspective, Member States should improve their capacity to anticipate the changes and the skills needs of European citizens and employers.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 16 December 2008 – ‘New skills for New Jobs: Anticipating and matching labour market and skills needs’ [        COM(2008) 868        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      SUMMARY     As part of the       renewed Lisbon Strategy      for growth and jobs, the Commission proposes an initiative aimed at improving workers' qualifications in accordance with the needs of European employers. It is based on a prospective analysis of labour market trends up to 2020.     There is great       potential for the creation of jobs i      n Europe in the medium and long term, particularly replacement jobs due to the ageing population. In addition, the market for ecological services and products should bring new types of job.      Skills and qualification requirements      will increase for all types and levels of occupation. Employers are looking in particular for transversal competencies such as communication skills or analytical and problem-solving skills.     The level of qualifications of the European workforce should meet the new needs of the labour market. This objective can be achieved by introducing active policies and by improving the effectiveness of education and training systems. The modernisation of labour markets also implies the implementation of the integrated strategies in the area of       flexicurity      .     The Commission encourages Member States to improve       the assessment and anticipation of trends      in the labour market and skills requirements. It proposes four strands of action:      the dissemination of information on the trends and new opportunities in the labour market, primarily by the setting up of a “European Labour Market Monitor” but also via the Commission’s employment, training and mobility services (EURES, PLOTEUS and EURAXESS);       the development of forecasting tools in order to produce accurate and regular data for each sector of activity. New joint methodologies should be developed via the PROGRESS programme and the         Lifelong Learning        Programme. Employers will be involved in anticipating needs and developing partnerships with a view to meeting those needs;       deepening international cooperation, developing policy dialogue and the exchange of experience;       mobilising the Community's political and financial instruments.       Context      This initiative is part of the European Economic Recovery Plan adopted in December 2008. It should help to reduce the consequences of the financial crisis on the labour markets.     The Commission will present a first report on the results of this initiative in 2010.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 734/2008 — protecting vulnerable marine ecosystems   what is the aim of the regulation  It sets out the rules for fishing vessels, registered in European Union (EU) countries, using bottom fishing gears  *  on the high seas outside areas regulated by  regional fisheries management organisations  or where such organisations have not adopted measures for these fisheries.   key points    Regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs)    In line with the  UN Convention on the Law of the Sea  , RFMOs are international organisations through which coastal states and other states fishing on the high seas cooperate in the conservation and management of fish stocks, particularly highly migratory or straddling fish stocks  *  , in a particular geographic area.   RFMOs have management powers to establish conservation and management measures such as catch and fishing limits, technical measures and control measures.   The EU, represented by the  European Commission  , plays an active role in a number of RFMOs.    Scope   The regulation applies to vessels carrying out fishing activities with bottom fishing gears:   outside an RFMO area;   in an area where an RFMO is in the stages of development and interim measures for the protection of the marine environment have been adopted.    Special fishing permits   Bottom fishing activities are only authorised when they present no risk of damaging vulnerable marine ecosystems. EU-registered vessels using bottom fishing gears in these areas must obtain a special fishing permit. Applications must include a detailed fishing plan specifying:   the area of activity;   the targeted species;   the type of gears used and the depth at which they will be used;   a map of the seabed where the fishing activities will be carried out, if the issuing authority does not have it.   Permits are issued by the country in which the vessel is registered. The responsible authorities of that country must:   assess the data relating to vulnerable marine ecosystems in the area specified in the fishing plan before issuing a permit. Where no proper scientific assessment has been carried out and made available, the use of bottom fishing gears is forbidden;   be notified of any changes to the fishing plan in order to assess whether vulnerable marine ecosystems will be threatened;   withdraw the permit of any vessel not complying with their fishing plan.    Area closures   In line with  UN General Assembly Resolution 61/105  of 2006, EU countries must identify areas where vulnerable marine ecosystems occur or are likely to occur on the basis of the best scientific information available, and close these areas to fishing with bottom gears. The Commission must be informed of any closures and must then inform the other EU countries.   Monitoring   Observers monitor the activities of vessels granted a special fishing permit until the fishing plan is completed. During this period, observers must:   compile information on the catch;   note changes to the fishing plan;   note any encounters with vulnerable ecosystems; as well as   record the depth at which gear is used.   A report must be sent to the competent authorities in the EU country concerned within 20 days of the mission ending. A copy is sent to the Commission.   from when does the regulation apply   It has applied since 31 July 2008.   * key terms     Bottom gears:  gears used in the normal course of fishing operations in contact with the seabed, including bottom trawls, dredges, bottom-set gill nets, bottom-set longlines, pots and traps.     Straddling fish stocks:  fisheries resources that migrate between the economic exclusion zones (i.e. a sea zone over which a country has special rights regarding the exploration and use of marine resources) and the high seas.
   Industrial policy in an enlarged Europe     Industrial policy in an enlarged Europe     1) OBJECTIVE     To trigger a debate on how industrial policy can improve the competitiveness of industry and to refine the integration of the various policy instruments that have an impact on industrial competitiveness.     2) ACT     Commission Communication of 11 December 2002 on industrial policy in an enlarged Europe [       COM (2002) 714      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     3) SUMMARY      Background      The communication is to be seen in the context of the European Councils in Lisbon in 2000 and Gothenburg in 2001. The Commission had, in a previous communication, stated that the current economic recession could jeopardise the goal set at Lisbon of making the European Union (EU), by 2010, 'the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion'. In addition, the Gothenburg summit had emphasised the need to promote the objective of sustainable development, whilst aiming at the simultaneous pursuit of the objectives under the economic, social and environmental pillars.     Industrial policy has a key role to play in helping the European Union meet the objectives it set itself at Lisbon and Gothenburg.     The communication takes a brief look at the situation of industry in the EU, listing its assets and handicaps. It also examines the implications of the future enlargement of the EU. The document also gives an overview of the challenges which European industry will have to face and suggests a number of actions to be taken to make it more competitive.      Analysis of the situation      In the face of competition which is now conducted at a global level, most sectors of European industry have made substantial efforts to upgrade their production infrastructures and integrate new forms of organisation.     In addition, following the emergence of certain decisive factors such as the growing importance of the internal market and the introduction of the euro, EU industry, and especially the services sector, experienced significant mergers and acquisitions activity in the second half of the 1990s.     The European Union is a major force in international trade. The reduction in the EU's market share of world trade is relative, given that whilst its figures fell from 19.3% over the 1991-95 period to 18.4% in 2002, the falls experienced by its main competitors were greater. Over the same period, the US share went down from 15.1% to 12.1%, and Japan's from 12.2% to 8.2%. Furthermore, the trade balance for EU goods was in surplus in nine of the last ten years.     Despite enterprises' demands for a more highly skilled workforce, levels of educational attainment are not high enough. Whilst the average duration of education of the working population in the European Union is increasing, the figures fall below those recorded in the USA and Japan, with the average duration in the EU being 87% and 90% of the average US and Japan levels respectively. When it comes to the EU's public spending on education and training as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), the figure has actually fallen from 5.7% in 1990 to 5% in 2001.     In the EU, labour productivity growth (GDP growth divided by the number of persons in employment) between 1995 and 2001 was lower (1.2%) than in the United States (1.9%), whereas the comparison was still in the EU's favour between 1985 and 1990. More specifically, two main reasons for this adverse trend have been analysed: the fact that investment in information and communication technologies (ICT) is not sufficiently translated into productivity gains and a lack of innovative activity as illustrated by the EU's low share of patent and research and development (R&D) activity compared to the USA and Japan. Especially in some sectors of industry, such as electronics, biotechnology or nanotechnology, the EU is lagging behind its competitors.     Even though they account for about two thirds of employment and 60% of total value added, relatively few small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Europe grow to the necessary critical size to compete effectively with large dominant incumbents or to enter foreign markets.      Enlargement      There are sizeable differences between the structure of manufacturing industry in the existing Member States and in the candidate countries. This is due to the fact that industry in the candidate countries is less specialised and more centred on low-technology sectors, such as food and beverages, textiles, basic metal industries and wood products. Significant progress has, however, been made in recent years in increasing labour productivity, even if this is, in all cases, still below 50% of the EU average.     All sectors have to cope with a difficult environment for companies to flourish: the cost of complying with the Community       acqu      is, especially environmental legislation; difficulties in accessing finance; insufficient support from the public authorities, etc. On the other hand, some SMEs in the existing Member States, mainly in border regions, could be faced with competition.     EU enlargement should offer opportunities for competitive reorganisation. For example, given the increased heterogeneity of wage structures and technological skills, the candidate countries have tended to specialise in low-cost production, which is reflected in limited transfers of production from the current Member States to the candidate countries. In addition, many EU enterprises have acquired companies in the candidate countries on the basis of local technological inputs and skills.      The challenges for a new industrial policy      The main challenges which European Union industrial policy will have to face are analysed in this communication as being:      globalisation: geographical location remains a crucial factor for research and innovation. It is therefore vital to improve the attractiveness of the EU as a productive location;       technological change: the aim is to combine information and communication technologies, new managerial and organisational techniques and develop a skilled labour force to help substantially improve the competitiveness of industry;       innovation and entrepreneurship: the competitiveness of companies is based on factors such as the continuous creation of new firms, and the growth of existing ones, particularly in times of rapid technological progress. European industry also requires the development and economic exploitation of new or improved products and services, and the optimisation of business processes. There is also a need to increase R&D expenditure relative to GDP, as the European Union lags behind its main competitors in this area;       sustainability and new societal demands: there is also a need to face up to the growing demand for safety, health, consumer and social protection, which in part reflects public concerns about the environmental, ethical, or public health implications of some new technologies. A fair balance must be struck between the Lisbon and Gothenburg goals.       The way forward      The communication is largely focused on the future and the outlook for industrial policy and improving the competitiveness of industry.      The framework conditions      : framework conditions are essential for the competitiveness of enterprises. Despite monetary union, the internal market and the liberalisation of certain sectors such as telecommunications, energy and transport, the efforts to introduce a more business-friendly environment still fall short of the mark. The following factors are particularly damaging in this respect, as they limit the room for manoeuvre in companies' activities:      regulatory barriers;       technical barriers;       the poor financial environment;       shortcomings in intellectual property protection in that there is no Community patent;       differences in indirect taxation and national corporate tax systems;       an inadequate corporate governance framework.       A more systematic approach to industrial policy      : the European Union has developed a number of general approaches to improve the business environment:      at EU level, the aim is to limit regulation to essential requirements linked to product safety or interoperability, allow manufacturers to declare conformity with the essential requirements, ask standards organisation bodies to develop harmonised European standards, and carry out an assessment of the impact of legislative initiatives on various categories of stakeholders, as provided for by the Commission in its 2002 Action Plan (         FR        ) (pdf);       at Member State level, the new open method of coordination should be put into practice. This involves compiling scoreboards, comparing the performances of individual Member States, exchanging best practices and setting quantitative targets.       Improving the integration of EU policies      : the competitiveness of enterprises is determined by a large number of policies. The EC Treaty takes this into account when it stipulates in Article 157 that the Community shall contribute to the achievement of the objectives of industrial policy through its other policies. It is essential to ensure appropriate integration between all EU activities that can contribute to meeting these objectives. These are, in particular, trade policy, single market-related policies, energy and transport policies, R&D policy, competition policy, regional policy and macroeconomic policy. In order to reconcile the objectives of the Lisbon European Council with those of the Gothenburg European Council, and simultaneously pursue economic, social and environmental objectives within the framework of the sustainability strategy, other policies need to be taken into account. These include social, employment and vocational training policies, consumer protection and public health policy, environmental protection and corporate social responsibility.      Enlargement, global governance and the horizontal approach      : Some industrial policy instruments should be adapted to the specific needs of the candidate countries, such as skills upgrading and SME development.     In addition, it is very much in the interest of the European Union to continue to develop globally accepted principles in fields such as environmental protection, consumer safety and social and labour standards, so that European companies are not placed at a disadvantage vis-à-vis their global competitors.     Industrial policy will continue to follow a horizontal approach in, for instance, actions to foster entrepreneurship and innovation. A vertical approach will also, however, be required to take account of the specific characteristics of certain sectors of industry: the strong requirement for R&D in the steel industry, environmental and consumer protection aspects in the chemical and biotechnology sectors, the fact that the internal market is still incomplete in the aerospace industry, and over-capacity in the telecommunications sector.      Specific tasks for the European Union      : more specifically, the following activities should be pursued:      Promotion of innovation, knowledge and research:- achieve the objective set by the European Union at the Barcelona European Council of raising the level of R&D investment to 3% of GDP by 2010;- develop technological platforms in order to foster cooperation between stakeholders and work out a long-term strategy for R&D and innovation, thus ensuring synergy among public authorities, users, regulators, industry, consumers, and poles of excellence;- invest in intangible assets and human capital in order to make the most efficient use of existing knowledge and maximise its diffusion;- look closely at the defence industries, in view of the specific nature of their high record in terms of research and innovation and their dependence on orders from the State.       Entrepreneurship:- increase entrepreneurial activity by improving the environment in which companies operate:- easier access to finance in the earlier stages of a company's life cycle;- enhance skills;- reduce regulatory and tax burdens.       The marketing of more environmentally-friendly products that are increasingly demanded by regulators and consumers:- the promotion of a viable recycling industry;- the development of voluntary agreements;- the diffusion of clean technologies;- the use of environmental management schemes.       4) implementing measures       5) follow-up work        Communication from the Commission -           Fostering structural change: an industrial policy for an enlarged Europe          [           COM(2004) 274          final - Not published in the Official Journal]         Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament -           Some Key Issues in Europe's Competitiveness - Towards an Integrated Approach          [           COM(2003) 704          final - Not published in the Official Journal].

summary of   Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/417 — guidelines for the management of the European Union Rapid Information System ‘RAPEX’   what is the aim of the decision   This  implementing  decision sets out guidelines for the management of the  EU Rapid Information System (RAPEX)  on  product safety and its notification system  , set up by Directive  2001/95/EC  , the General Product Safety Directive (GPSD).   This implementing decision seeks in particular to update the scope of the system integrating certain aspects of Regulation (EC) No  765/2008  on the  market surveillance of harmonised products  , as well as to reference to new tools developed in recent years for the proper functioning of RAPEX (wiki, interface between RAPEX and  ICSMS  , the Information and Communication System on Market Surveillance platform set up under Regulation (EC) No 765/2008) and establish risk assessment methods and, in particular, criteria for identifying serious risks.   It repeals Decision  2010/15/EU  .   key points    Scope   These guidelines cover  2 sets of products  :   products covered by the GPSD;   products covered by Regulation (EC) No  765/2008  on the accreditation and market surveillance of non-food products.This implies the inclusion of professional products and the extension of the risks to other risks than those for the health and safety of consumers, e.g. environmental risks.   The decision does  not  cover the following:     food and feed  and other products  covered by Regulation (EC) No  178/2002  ;    medicinal products  covered by Directive  2001/83/EC  (  EU rules on the authorisation, import and production of medicines for humans  ) and Directive  2001/82/EC  (  EU rules on the authorisation, import and production of veterinary medicines  );     medical devices   covered by Regulation (EU)  2017/745  ;     active implantable medical devices   covered by Directive  90/385/EEC  ;    second-hand products  , antiques, or products to be repaired or reconditioned prior to use;    equipment used by professional service providers  to supply a service.    RAPEX   RAPEX was set up for the rapid exchange of information between EU countries and the  European Commission  on products posing a serious risk to the health and safety of consumers. Its main features are that it:   prevents and restricts the supply of dangerous products;   monitors the effectiveness and consistency of market surveillance and enforcement activities;   identifies needs and provides a basis for action at EU level; and   ensures consistent enforcement of the EU product safety requirements.    Risk    Before an authority of an EU country decides to submit a RAPEX notification, it assesses whether the product to be notified poses a risk to the health and safety of consumers or, in the case of products covered by Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, a serious risk to the health, safety or, for example, security or the environment, of the end-users, and thus whether one of the RAPEX notification criteria is met.   Risk assessment guidelines and case studies are included in an appendix to the decision.    Action notified through RAPEX   Action to prevent or restrict sales can be taken, in relation to products posing a risk, either voluntarily by manufacturers or distributors, or ordered by an authority of an EU country. Measures include, albeit not exclusively:   marking a product with warnings about risks;   making the marketing of a product subject to conditions;   warning consumers and end-users of risks;   temporary ban on the product’s supply or display;   ban on the marketing of a product;   withdrawal of a product from the market;   recall of a product from consumers;   destruction of a withdrawn or recalled product.    Notifications   Participation in RAPEX is mandatory for EU countries, who must notify the Commission where the following  4 criteria  are met for a product:   the product falls under the scope of application of the GPSD or under the scope of application of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008;   it is subject to measures that prevent, restrict or impose specific conditions on its possible marketing or use (‘preventive and restrictive measures’);   it poses a risk to the health and safety of consumers or, in case of products covered by Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, also to other relevant public interests of the end-users;   it cannot be ruled out that the effect of the serious risk to the health and safety of consumers or, in case of products covered by Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, also to other relevant public interests of the end-users, goes beyond the territory of the notifying EU country.   Additional provisions for notifications covered by the decision include:   streamlining the processes for notification;   setting out the notification criteria;   defining the content of notifications;   establishing follow-up requirements for EU countries;   describing how notifications and their follow-up are handled by the Commission;   setting deadlines for the various types of action taken under the notification mechanisms;   setting out the practical and technical arrangements needed at Commission and national level for the notification mechanisms to be employed effectively and efficiently.   from when does the implementing decision apply  It has applied since 12 November 2018.   background   For more information, see:    Product safety rules  (  European Commission  )    General Product Safety Directive  (  European Commission  )    Safety Gate  (  European Commission  )    Rapex (Rapid Alert System – Non-Food)  (  European Commission  ).
   Motor vehicles and their trailers: steering equipment (until 2014)     Motor vehicles and their trailers: steering equipment (until 2014)     The European Union is harmonising the technical requirements concerning steering equipment to permit the implementation of the Community type-approval procedure covered by Directive       70/156/EEC      . The technical requirements are contained in the Annex to the Directive.     ACT     Council Directive       70/311/EEC      of 8 June 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the steering equipment for motor vehicles and their trailers [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     "Steering equipment" means equipment used to alter the direction of movement of the vehicle.     No Member State may refuse to grant EC type approval or national type approval of a vehicle on grounds relating to its steering equipment, if this equipment satisfies the requirements set out in the Annex to the Directive.     Member States may not prohibit the sale, registration or entry into service of vehicles on grounds relating to the steering equipment if the vehicles comply with the requirements of Directive       70/311/EEC      .     However, from 1 October 2000, Member States may no longer grant EC type-approval, and may refuse to grant national type-approval for any type of vehicle on grounds relating to the steering equipment if the requirements of Directive       70/311/EEC      are not fulfilled.

act   Council Decision  2014/51/EU  of 28 January 2014 authorising Member States to ratify, in the interests of the European Union, the Convention concerning decent work for domestic workers, 2011, of the International Labour Organisation (Convention No 189).   summary   The European Union agreed in early 2014 a decision authorising EU countries to ratify the ILO’s convention of 2011 concerning decent work for domestic workers (Convention No 189). This decision is needed because parts of the convention fall within the EU’s competence. The EU itself cannot ratify any ILO convention, because only states can be parties to them.   Definition   A domestic worker is defined as any person engaged in domestic work (work performed in or for a household or households) within an employment relationship.   Main provisions   The convention requires ratifying states to:   establish a  minimum age  for domestic work and  safeguards for workers under age 18  ;   prevent  abuse  and  violence  ;   ensure  fair terms  and  decent conditions  of employment;   make certain that workers are  informed  of the terms and details of their employment;   regulate  foreign recruitment  and ensure freedom of movement;   mandate  equal treatment  between domestic workers and other workers with regard to  compensation and benefits, for example in the case of maternity  ; and   develop a specific  complaints mechanism  .    Similar approaches of the ILO and EU   EU law already addresses some aspects covered by the ILO convention. The provisions of the convention share the same approach as this legislation. On certain issues, EU law is more protective than the convention whereas the convention is more precise than EU law in the coverage of domestic workers by legislation and in other particular aspects of domestic work.   Background   In June 2012, in its  EU strategy towards the eradication of trafficking in human beings  , the Commission urged Member States to ratify all relevant international instruments, agreements and legal obligations which will contribute to addressing trafficking in human beings in a more effective, coordinated and coherent manner, including the domestic workers convention.

   Contribution to the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance     Contribution to the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance     The purpose of this communication is to contribute to the debate at the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance (hereafter referred to as the World Conference) by highlighting the measures taken to combat racism in the European Union (EU). To inspire the debate by reiterating the recommendations presented by the Commission at the Regional European Conference in October 2000.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 1 June 2001. Contribution to the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance [       COM(2001)291      final - Not published in the Official Journal]     SUMMARY      Context      The decision to hold a World Conference in 2001 was taken in 1997 by the United Nations General Assembly. Organised by the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, it focused on action-oriented and practical steps to eradicate racism. Its main objectives were to: assess the fight against racial discrimination and its future, increase the level of awareness about racism and its consequences, formulate recommendations to the United Nations (UN) on ways to increase the effectiveness of its actions, etc. The European Commission played an active part in the preparations for the World Conference. On the one hand, it attended the preparatory Conference entitled 'All Different - All Equal: From Principle to Practice' held at the Council of Europe. On the other hand, it contributed EUR 3.7 million to non-governmental organisations (NGOs), the least developed countries (to ensure their participation) and the World Conference itself. It also helped to draw up the political declaration and programme of action adopted at the Conference. It is in this context that this communication was drawn up. It aims to demonstrate the success of the fight against racism in the EU with a view to inspiring the Conference participants to work together within regional groupings.      Actions in the European Union      Action at European level has taken two general forms: a number of legislative acts have been adopted and the fight against racism has been mainstreamed into other policies.      The legislative measures      include efforts to harmonise legislation in the Member States as previously, although discrimination was banned, the scope, content and enforcement of the legislation varied considerably from one country to another. A package of proposals to combat discrimination including two directives and an action programme were thus adopted in 1999. These proposals included Directive       2000/43/EC      implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin. Aimed at preventing racial discrimination in the Union, the directive strengthens the position of victims and requires the establishment of independent bodies capable of conducting surveys and studies in the field. Moreover, in 1996, it was agreed that judicial cooperation should be established between the Member States, so as to prevent, in particular, those responsible for crimes from avoiding prosecution by moving from one Member State to another. Lastly, the Commission has presented five proposals for directives on immigration and asylum issues (since the end of 1999). These relate, in particular, to family reunification, temporary protection in case of mass influx of displaced persons, procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status, the status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents and reception conditions for asylum-seekers.      Mainstreaming in other Community policies      involves the employment policy, the external relations policy and programmes providing financial support.     The European employment strategy pursued by the EU since 1997 is an important instrument in the fight against racism. The employment guidelines which have, since 1999, included the principle of non-discrimination in the labour market, are the EU's own contribution. The Member States are required to pay particular attention to the needs of ethnic minorities and other groups and persons likely to be disadvantaged, and to formulate appropriate policies of prevention and action to promote their integration into the labour market.     The external relations policy deals with racism through the preparations for enlargement (whereby the candidate countries are required to satisfy the Copenhagen criteria and to       combat racism      , especially with regard to the Roma population), the agreements with the New Independent States (NIS), the Common Strategy on Russia and the development policy.     Many EU programmes that provide financial aid contain provisions on racism. These include:      the         Community action programme to combat discrimination        , which has a budget of EUR 100 million for 2001-2006;       the         Community initiative EQUAL        , which deals with discrimination on the labour market and has been allocated almost EUR 3 billion for the 2000-2006 period;       the programme relating to the Community framework strategy on gender equality, which focuses on the situation of women;       the         European Fund for Refugees        , which provides support for the reception, integration and voluntary repatriation of refugees;       the         Grotius programme        , which aims to foster legal cooperation on general and criminal issues between the Member States of the European Union;       external programmes such as those financed by the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (         EIDHR        ), which has a budget of EUR 110 million for 2002,         Phare        , which concentrates on the candidate countries, Tacis, which focuses on the NIS and Mongolia and, finally, projects relating to the Republics of Former Yugoslavia and those organised under the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe;       programmes in the field of education and youth, such as         Socrates        ,         Leonardo da Vinci        and         Youth        together with the Fifth framework programme for research and technological development.       Evaluation, monitoring and analysis of activities in the European Union      In addition to monitoring by the European Commission, which is responsible for ensuring respect for the Treaties and other Community laws, the       European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia      has established a European Racism and Xenophobia Information Network (Raxen). This network, whose task is to gather data and information on racism and xenophobia, incorporates research centres, NGOs and specialised centres, and its activities could be extended to the candidate countries.     Independent evaluation of Community actions and policies is also of importance, especially with a view to ensuring that the efforts made to combat racism are effective. This is a prerequisite for all the projects and actions supported by the programmes listed above.      Commission recommendations      The Commission hopes that the participants in the World Conference take account of the European Union's action against racism as well as the recommendations presented by the Commission at the Regional European Conference in October 2000. These call on all participants to establish or maintain:      a combination of legislation and practical action to combat racism;       cooperation with the NGOs and the social partners;       specific policies involving the host society in order to promote respect for cultural diversity;       practical measures concerning the labour market;       access without discrimination to education and measures to combat discrimination in the media, culture and sport;       research in this area;       systematic mainstreaming of the fight against racism in the external relations and human rights policies;       legislative protection against racial discrimination;       effective, proportionate and deterrent criminal penalties for racist and xenophobic behaviour.      RELATED ACTS      Council Conclusions on the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance. General Affairs Council - 16 July 2001 [Not published in the Official Journal].      The General Affairs Council (GAC) reiterated the European Union's desire to contribute to the success of the World Conference. In its conclusions, the Council stresses that the World Conference might represent a mobilising factor in the fight against racism. To achieve satisfactory results, it is essential for the Action Programme and the Declaration to be forward-looking and oriented towards action. It also emphasises that racism and racial discrimination must be fought by all legal means and it refers to the European Union's many efforts mentioned in the above communication.     The Council thus hopes that the World Conference's priorities include strengthening the legal framework for combating racism and improving education, training and the prevention of racism. Moreover, it calls for greater priority to be given to what is known as multiple racism, in other words cases where an individual belongs to several categories that are subject to discrimination, such as the Roma population, women and disabled people.     In order to ensure the success of the Conference, the Council feels it is necessary for NGOs and other actors in civil society to contribute and for a global strategy aimed at increasing international cooperation to be drawn up.     Deploring the effects of colonialism, such as slavery, the Council highlights the European Union's current efforts to achieve a more just world, in particular through its development cooperation. It concludes by calling on the participating countries to work together in a spirit of cooperation, which is essential if the World Conference is to be a success.

   Processed cereal-based foods and baby foods for infants and young children     Processed cereal-based foods and baby foods for infants and young children     SUMMARY OF:      Directive 2006/125/EC on processed cereal-based foods and baby foods for infants and young children      WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?      It lays down harmonised rules for the composition and labelling of processed cereal-based foods and baby foods for infants         *        and young children         *        .       These products are carefully monitored since they may contain pesticide residues         *        which may endanger the health of this sensitive population group. Pesticide residues are prohibited or controlled on the basis of maximum permissible quantities which may not exceed the acceptable daily intake values.       It is a specific directive within the meaning of Directive         89/398/EEC        , a directive which has since been replaced by Regulation (EU) No         609/2013        on food intended for infants and young children, food for special medical purposes, and total diet replacement for weight control (see         summary        ).       It         codifies        previous directives (         96/5/EC        ,         98/36/EC        ,         1999/39/EC        and         2003/13/EC        ).      KEY POINTS      Scope      This directive covers foodstuffs for particular nutritional use that fulfil the nutritional requirements of infants and young children in good health and are intended for use by infants while they are being weaned, and by young children as a supplement to their diet and/or for their progressive adaptation to ordinary food.     They comprise:       processed cereal-based foods        , which are divided into the following         4 categories        :          simple cereals which are or have to be reconstituted with milk or other appropriate nutritious liquids;           cereals with an added high protein food which are or have to be reconstituted with water or other protein-free liquid;           pastas which are to be used after cooking in boiling water or other appropriate liquids;           rusks and biscuits which are to be used either directly or, after pulverisation, with the addition of water, milk or other suitable liquids;          baby foods        other than processed cereal-based foods.      This directive       does not apply to milks intended for young children      .      General obligation      EU countries must ensure that only products which comply with this directive are sold.      Composition       Only ingredients suitable for particular nutritional use for infants and young children (supported by scientific data) may be used in the manufacture of the foods concerned.       Processed cereal-based foods must comply with the         compositional criteria        specified in         Annex I        .       Baby foods which are described in         Annex II        must comply with the compositional criteria specified therein.       Only the nutritional substances listed in         Annex IV        may be added in the manufacture of processed cereal-based foods and baby foods within the maximum limits laid down by the directive. The purity criteria for those substances must be laid down at a later stage.       Processed cereal-based foods and baby foods may not contain any substance in such quantity as to endanger the health of infants and young children (see Regulation (EC) No         1881/2006        ) (see         summary        ).       Labelling      In addition to the       mandatory particulars      stipulated by Regulation (EU) No       1169/2011      (see       summary      ), labelling must bear the following information:      the         age from which the product may be used        , which must not be less than 4 months. Products recommended for use from the age of 4 months may indicate that they are suitable from that age unless persons having qualifications in medicine, nutrition etc. advise otherwise;       the         presence or absence of gluten        if the indicated age from which the product may be used is below 6 months;       the         available energy value        (in kJ and kcal) and the protein, carbohydrate and lipid content (in numerical form) per 100 g or 100 ml of the product as sold and, where appropriate, per specified quantity of the product as proposed for consumption;       the         average quantity of each mineral substance        and of         each vitamin        governed by a specific level in         Annex I        and         Annex II        respectively, expressed in numerical form, per 100 g or 100 ml of the product as sold and, where appropriate, per specified quantity of the product as proposed for consumption;        instructions for appropriate preparation        , when necessary, and a statement as to the importance of following those instructions.      The labelling may include       non-mandatory particulars      :      the         average quantity of the nutrients        set out in         Annex IV        (in numerical form) per 100 g or 100 ml of the product as sold and, where appropriate, per specified quantity of the product as proposed for consumption;        information on vitamins and minerals        shown in         Annex V        (as a percentage of the reference values given therein) per 100 g or 100 ml of the product as sold, and where appropriate, per specified quantity of the product as proposed for consumption, provided that the quantities present are at least equal to 15% of the reference values.       Maximum pesticide levels       This directive sets the         maximum permissible level of pesticide residues        in processed cereal-based foods and baby foods at 0.01 mg/kg, except for certain substances whose limit is laid down in         Annex VI        .        Standardised analytical methods        must be used for determining the presence of pesticide residues.       Prohibited pesticides       This directive prohibits the use of certain pesticides in agricultural products intended for baby foods (list in         Annex VII        ).       For         pesticides or pesticide metabolites        in this list, the maximum level of 0.01 mg/kg may be excessive for infants and young children. This is the case for pesticides or metabolites of pesticides with an acceptable daily intake lower than 0.0005 mg/kg body weight.       The         limit of quantification of the analytical methods        is 0.003 mg/kg. At this level, pesticides are considered not to have been used. This limit may be altered in the light of technical progress or data on environmental contamination.      FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?     It has applied since 26 December 2006.     BACKGROUND     For more information, see:       Food for infants and young children        (         European Commission        ).

act   Directive  2006/95/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on the harmonisation of the laws of Member States relating to electrical equipment designed for use within certain voltage limits (codified version).   summary   This Directive aims at ensuring that electrical equipment may be placed on the market only if it does not, when installed and maintained, endanger the safety of persons, domestic animals or property, and at promoting the free movement of this equipment in the EU.   Scope   This Directive applies to electrical equipment designed for use with a voltage rating of between 50 and 1000 Volts for alternating current and between 75 and 1500 Volts for direct current.  It does not apply to:        —     electrical equipment for use in an explosive atmosphere;            —     equipment for radiology and medical purposes;            —     electrical parts for goods and passenger lifts;            —     electricity meters;            —     plugs and socket outlets for domestic use;            —     electric fence controllers;            —     radio-electrical interference;            —     electrical equipment for use on ships, aircraft or railways;            —     electrical equipment intended for export to third countries.       Safety objectives   Electrical equipment may be placed on the market if it complies with the safety objectives laid down in Annex I to this Directive concerning:        —     general safety conditions applying to equipment;            —     hazards arising from electrical equipment;            —     hazards caused by external influences on electrical equipment.      The free movement of electrical equipment must not be hindered if it meets the safety objectives defined in the Directive. Manufacturers may choose how they comply with safety objectives.   Presumption of conformity   Electrical equipment which complies with the provisions of the harmonised standards should be subject to a presumption of conformity with the safety objectives established by this Directive and be able to move freely.  Standards are regarded as harmonised if they are drawn up by common agreement between the bodies notified by the EU countries and published under national procedures. Their references must be published in the  Official Journal of the European Union  .  If standards have not yet been harmonised, EU countries should take measures to ensure that their competent administrative authorities regard electrical equipment as complying with the safety objectives of the Directive if the electrical equipment complies with the safety provisions of the International Commission on the Rules for the Approval of Electrical Equipment (CEEel) or of the  International Electrotechnical Commission  (IEC).  If harmonised standards or safety provisions do not yet exist, EU countries must take measures to ensure that their competent administrative authorities regard electrical equipment as complying with the safety objectives of the Directive if the electrical equipment is in accordance with the safety standards in force in the EU country of manufacture.   Placing on the market   Before placing electrical equipment on the market:        —     the manufacturer or his authorised representative established in the European Union must affix the ‘CE’ marking to each product and draw up a written ‘EC’ declaration of conformity;            —     the manufacturer must establish the technical documentation.      The ‘EC’ declaration of conformity must contain:        —     the name and address of the manufacturer or his authorised representative established in the EU;            —     a description of the electrical equipment;            —     a reference to the harmonised standards;            —     if required, references to the specifications with which conformity is declared;            —     identification of the signatory who has been empowered to enter into commitments on behalf of the manufacturer or his authorised representative established in the EU;            —     the last two digits of the year in which the ‘CE’ marking was affixed.       Safeguard   If, for safety reasons, an EU country prohibits the placing on the market of any electrical equipment or impedes its free movement, it shall inform the Commission and the other countries concerned.   Repeal   Directive 2006/95/EC has been repealed by Directive  2014/35/EU  with effect from 20 April 2016.

summary   The labelling of prepackages* and prepacked products* must contain various information relevant to the consumer.  Prepacked products are sold individually at a constant weight or volume chosen in advance by the filler. The weight or volume must be:   at least 5 grams or 5 millilitres for the smallest packages;   no more than 10 kilograms or 10 litres for the largest packages.    Use of the ‘e’ sign   Prepacked products may bear the lower case letter ‘e’ of a minimum height of 3 mm certifying that under the responsibility of the packer or the importer that the prepackages meet the requirements of this directive in terms of quality and metrological controls (Annex I point 5 and Annex II).  The letter must be placed in the same field of vision as the indication of the nominal weight or nominal volume.   Indication of weight or volume   The labelling must indicate the volume in the case of liquid products and the weight in the case of other products.  The label of the prepacked product must also bear the weight and volume indications used in trade practice or comply with the national regulations of the destination country if such indications vary in EU countries.  EU countries may neither prohibit nor restrict the placing on the market of packaging which complies with the directive's requirements with regard to the indication of the volume or mass and the metrological methods used.   from when does the directive apply  It applies from 23 January 1976. Most EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 22 July 1977. Belgium, Ireland and the United Kingdom (   1   ) had to incorporate it into national law by 31 December 1979.   key terms    * Prepackage  : the combination of a product and the individual package in which it is prepacked.   * Prepacked product  : a product is prepacked when it is placed in a package of whatever nature without the purchaser being present and the quantity of product contained in the package has a predetermined value and cannot be altered without the package either being opened or undergoing a perceptible modification.   act   Council Directive  76/211/EEC  of 20 January 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the making-up by weight or by volume of certain prepackaged products (OJ L 46, 21.2.1976, pp. 1–11)  Successive amendments and corrections to Directive 76/211/EEC have been incorporated in the basic text.

summary of   Directive 2014/31/EU relating to non-automatic weighing instruments   what is the aim of the directive  It lays down uniform, EU-wide rules on the sale and putting into service of non-automatic weighing instruments (NAWIs)  *  . NAWIs are important for trade, consumers and industry as they ensure the accuracy of measurements and help the transparency and fairness of commercial transactions.  It aims to:   establish the essential requirements that NAWIs have to satisfy;   introduce simpler, clearer and more-consistent rules, thus ensuring traceability;   reduce administrative burdens for manufacturers, importers and distributors;   ensure that instruments compliant with the essential requirements can circulate freely within the EU.   Benefits should include:   compliant and more accurate NAWIs on the EU market and increased levels of public trust in them;   fewer non-compliant instruments and distortions of competition on the market arising from different enforcement practices;   protection of the public from wrong measurements;   increased room for technological innovation, by adopting a modern regulatory approach.   The directive  recasts  and repeals Directive  2009/23/EC  .   key points   The directive brings the NAWI legislation into line with the EU’s ‘  new legislative framework  ’. This framework comprises 2 complementary texts:   Regulation (EC) No  765/2008  on   accreditation and market surveillance   ; and   Decision No  768/2008/EC  on   uniform conditions for the marketing of safe products   in the EU (  conformity marking  ).    Scope    The directive applies to all NAWIs that are new to the EU market when they are placed on that market or put into service, that is that they are:   new NAWIs made by a manufacturer established in the EU; or   NAWIs imported from a non-EU country, whether they are new or second hand.     The directive applies to all forms of supply of NAWIs, including distance selling.   The directive distinguishes the following categories of use of NAWIs for determination of weight for:   commercial transactions;   the calculation of a toll, tariff, tax, bonus, penalty, remuneration, indemnity or similar type of payment;   the application of laws or regulations or for an expert opinion given in court proceedings;   the practice of medicine for weighing patients for the purposes of monitoring, diagnosis and medical treatment;   preparing medicines on prescription in a pharmacy and determining weight in analyses carried out in medical and pharmaceutical laboratories;   the purposes of direct sales to the public and the preparation of pre-packages.      Responsibilities of manufacturers, importers and distributors    Manufacturers  must ensure that:   all NAWIs on sale in the EU bear the conformity marking consisting of the  European conformity (CE) marking  plus the  supplementary metrology (M) marking  , with the last two digits of the year of its affixing and the accredited  notified body   *  number(s), indicating that they meet all the  essential requirements  set out in  Annex I  to the directive;   they lodge an application for  EU-type examination  with a single notified body of their choice in line with  Annex II to the directive  on  conformity assessment procedures  ;   they conduct a  risk and conformity assessment  and draw up  technical documentation  for the NAWI before affixing the CE + M markings (see  Annex III to the directive  );   they (and if they appoint an authorised representative  *  ) keep the  technical documentation  and the  EU declaration of conformity  (as set out in  Annex IV  to the directive) for  10 years  after the NAWI has been placed on the market;   they indicate on the NAWI their name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and the postal address where they can be contacted to ensure  traceability  ;   in the event they believe that NAWIs they have placed on the market  do not conform  , take  corrective measures  to bring them into conformity, withdraw or recall them;    instructions and information  accompanying the NAWI are written in language easily understood by its end users and that they, as well as any labelling, are  clear and understandable  .    Importers  must ensure that:   NAWIs they place on the market comply with the  essential requirements  ;   manufacturers have carried out conformity assessments correctly and  inform the market-surveillance authority  if they consider that the NAWIs do not comply;   they  indicate  on the NAWI their name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and the postal address where they can be contacted;    marking  of NAWIs and  documentation  drawn up by manufacturers are  available for inspection  by the competent authorities.    Distributors  must ensure that:   NAWIs under their responsibility, their storage or transport conditions  do not place at risk the instruments’ compliance  with the essential requirements;   NAWIs bear the  necessary markings  ;   in the event they believe that NAWIs they have made available on the market  do not conform  , take corrective measures to bring them into conformity, withdraw or recall them.   In addition, the directive:   introduces  requirements  for  notifying authorities  and the  procedures for notification  ;   specifies how  national authorities  that monitor safety must identify and prevent the import from non-EU countries of NAWIs that endanger the health and safety of persons;   includes rules on  penalties  for infringements by manufacturers, importers and distributors which may include criminal penalties in serious cases.   from when does the directive apply  Directive 2014/31/EU  revised  and replaced Directive  2002/95/EC  and had to be applied in the EU countries as of 20 April 2016.   background   For more information, see:    Legal metrology  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Non-automatic weighing instrument:  a weighing instrument requiring human intervention during weighing.   Notified body:  an independent organisation designated by an EU country to assess the conformity of certain products before they are placed on the market. It carries out tasks related to conformity-assessment procedures set out in the relevant legislation, when the intervention of an external authority is required.   Authorised representative:  any individual or organisation established in the EU with a written mandate from a manufacturer to act on their behalf.
   Supporting developing countries in coping with the crisis     Supporting developing countries in coping with the crisis     The international financial crisis poses a threat to global stability. The European Union (EU) supports an approach to development aid with the aim of stimulating economic growth, combating poverty and respecting the environment.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 8 April 2009 - Supporting developing countries in coping with the crisis [       COM(2009) 160      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Developing countries are particularly vulnerable to the effects of the international financial crisis. Development policies have improved their economic situation, but their resilience capacity remains limited.     Their monetary and budgetary policies are particularly constrained by inflation peaks, exchange rate volatility, deteriorating external balances,       rising food prices      and increasing energy costs. The European Union (EU) has chosen to support the countries that are most vulnerable to the effects of the crisis as a priority. These countries may be identified by combining several criteria corresponding to the main channels by which the crisis has been spread to developing countries, in particular:      dependence on export revenues and the degree of integration into world trade;       dependence on international financial flows and transfers;       capacity to react in response to the crisis.       Funding aid      The EU provides the largest portion of Official Development Aid (ODA), almost EUR 50 billion or 59 % of ODA overall. Its contribution is increasing, but Member States should nevertheless commit to add a further EUR 20 billion of aid in order to meet their objectives set for 2010 (0.56 % of Gross Domestic Income).     This increase in ODA is essential for participating in economic recovery and meeting the       Millennium Development Goals      (MDGs). Aid must be supplemented by the use and mobilisation of other development resources and instruments. This is the case for export credits, investment guarantees, technology transfer and innovative development funding mechanisms (e.g. voluntary solidarity levies, such as the airline tax applied by some Member States).     The Commission recommends that Member States adopt counter-cyclical development policies consisting of:      adapting 2009 and 2010 strategies and programmes, and re-directing EIB loans to key sectors in order to eliminate the crisis and boost economic activity (infrastructures, energy, activities related to climate change, green growth and the financial sector);       accelerating payment and making advances on aid commitments and budgetary support for all countries, in particular for those in a situation of emergency;       giving macro-economic assistance, for ENP countries, accession and pre-accession countries, in cooperation with the IMF.       Aid effectiveness      The fragmentation of agencies and bilateral or multilateral donors, and the lack of stability and predictability of funding have a high cost. It would be possible to make gains in effectiveness each year, which could translate into billions of euros allocated to supporting reforms, projects and action. The EU has adopted a       European programme for aid effectiveness      and a       Code of Conduct on the Division of Labour      . In 2008, it committed to the       Accra Agenda for Action      and plays an essential role in rationalising international development aid architecture.     The Commission proposes to accelerate the implementation of these programmes, as well as the application of the Commission Recommendations aimed at ensuring maximum impact for EU aid.      Recovery measures      In order to combat the social effects of the crisis and to contribute to the MDGs, particular support must be given to social protection systems and labour markets. Thus in 2009 and 2010, almost EUR 500 million will be committed under the       European Development Fund      (EDF), in order to protect public spending in essential sectors. This funding is to be implemented through:      the FLEX system which allows export losses to be compensated for according to the years preceding the crisis;       the additional and temporary "vulnerability FLEX" system, established expressly to respond more quickly and in a targeted way to the crisis in the most vulnerable countries.      Growth and employment are also promoted by the funding of infrastructures (EU-Africa Trust Fund), through support for agriculture and the creation of links between places of production and sale, by means of measures to foster private trade and the increase of credit facilities (in particular, the EIB’s investment facility, the Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP), and the ENP investment facility for Eastern Europe).     The support provided by the EU in the context of the crisis also includes measures adopted to meet the food crisis (particularly the Food Facility with a budget of EUR 1 billion) which persists in many countries.     Recovery strategies take into account objectives for sustainable development and tackling climate change, including in the Least Developed Countries (LDCs).     Sustainable economic development necessitates the strengthening of economic and financial governance, including tax governance. Fighting corruption and the introduction of a healthy macro-economic and regulatory environment should be the key elements in political dialogue between the EU and its partner countries.     The EU should also work towards a better balance of the global governance system (particularly within the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank), in order to make these authorities more complementary and to ensure greater representation for developing countries.

   i2010 Intelligent Car Initiative (third eSafety communication)     i2010 Intelligent Car Initiative (third eSafety communication)     The European Commission’s Intelligent Car Initiative is designed to promote the use of new technologies to make cars safer, cleaner and more efficient. The Initiative aims to provide an answer to social problems related to road transport, primarily accidents and traffic congestion.     ACT     Commission communication of 15 February 2006 on the Intelligent Car Initiative – "Raising Awareness of ICT for Smarter, Safer and Cleaner Vehicles” [       COM(2006) 59      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The increased use of road transport brings with it a number of worrying problems: congestion of road networks and urban areas, harmful effects on the environment and public health, waste of energy and, above all, injuries, material damage and fatal accidents. The Intelligent Car Initiative is intended to help resolve these road traffic problems.      POTENTIAL OF INTELLIGENT CARS      The use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in building intelligent cars can contribute towards:      increasing road safety;       making transport systems more efficient;       using fuel more efficiently;       helping drivers to prevent or avoid accidents;       providing drivers with real-time information about the road network in order to avoid congestion;       enabling drivers to optimise journeys.      More specifically, studies have shown that the use of ICT could enable the number of accidents in the European Union (EU) to be reduced considerably. For example, 1 500 accidents a year could be avoided if 0.6 % of vehicles were equipped with systems helping them to stay in lane or to overtake.      JUSTIFICATION FOR EUROPEAN ACTION      Despite their potential, most intelligent systems are not yet on the market. The vehicles equipped with new-generation systems are mainly top-of-the-range cars representing only a small percentage of the market.     The large-scale deployment of active safety systems (ABS, adaptive cruise control, etc.), has sometimes faced numerous obstacles, including legal barriers, the high cost of intelligent systems and the lack of public information. Moreover, the extremely competitive situation in the automotive sector creates conditions which are unfavourable to the development of these systems.     A comprehensive approach at EU level will enable harmonised solutions to be found. This will involve removing obstacles to market deployment, stimulating product demand and building consensus among key players. Moreover, pollution, road safety and congestion are problems common to all the Member States. Action at European level is therefore all the more appropriate.      OBJECTIVES OF THE INITIATIVE       Coordination of effort      The first objective of the initiative is to support and coordinate the work of relevant stakeholders, citizens, Member States and the industry in order to speed up the development and application of intelligent systems.     In this context, the       eSafety Forum      has a vital role to play. Set up in 2003, the Forum aims to remove the obstacles preventing intelligent vehicle systems from entering the market.     In addition to the Forum’s work, the initiatives which will be taken in support of this first objective also include:      following up and reporting on the actions proposed in the second eSafety communication "         Bringing eCall to Citizens        ". The follow-up will relate mainly to the signature of the memorandum of understanding on the         eCall system        by Member States, implementation of the single emergency numbers 112 and E112, and upgrading the PSAPs (Public Service Answering Points);       presenting a Commission         recommendation        on the design and safe use of Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI);       investigating the possibility of using         incentive schemes at national level        to stimulate the purchase of vehicles equipped with safety functions;       examining         spectrum        needs in the context of vehicle-to-vehicle communication and assessing the implications of the Intelligent Car Initiative for spectrum use;       following up the recommendation on the establishment of a         European Code of Practice        for the development and testing of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems.       Supporting research and development (R&D) work      The long-term objectives of the Intelligent Car Initiative form part of the information and communication technologies priority of the       7th R&D Framework Programme      .     To support research and development in the sphere of smarter, cleaner and safer vehicles, the Commission proposes the following action:      targeting research at the needs of the         next generation of driver assistance systems        , (in particular enhanced performance, reliability, security and reduced fuel consumption) and undertaking additional research work on         traffic and traveller information services        ;       implementing, through the 7th R&D Framework Programme, an         assessment programme        based on field operational tests to assess in real environments the impact of intelligent systems on driver behaviour and driving dynamics;       setting up an         independent conformance testing and performance assessment programme        for road safety and efficiency systems based on ICT.       Awareness      The third objective of the Intelligent Car Initiative is to promote the dissemination of information to a wide audience in order to make drivers and policymakers aware of the potential of intelligent vehicle systems. This greater awareness will help to stimulate user demand and to promote socio-economic acceptance.     Within this awareness component, the Commission proposes the following action:      holding regular         i2010 Intelligent Car Initiative events        ;       producing         television series or documentaries        on ICT-based systems and launching a comprehensive benchmarking study on ongoing activities in promoting intelligent vehicle systems in the Member States and in the industry;       establishing an         eSafety Communication Platform        with the aim of improving, coordinating and harmonising the end-user communication of the various stakeholders;       supporting and promoting         stakeholders’ initiatives        which pursue the objectives of the Intelligent Car Initiative.       Background      The Intelligent Car Initiative is part of the EU's       i2010 strategy      aimed at generally stimulating the development of the digital economy in Europe. It also continues to build on the foundations laid in the 2004 White Paper on       transport policy challenges between now and 2010      , which seeks, among other things, to reduce by half the number of road fatalities by 2010.     RELATED ACTS      Communication of 17 September 2007 from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: “Towards Europe-wide Safer, Cleaner and Efficient Mobility: The First Intelligent Car Report” [         COM(2007) 541        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      Considerable progress has already been achieved with the Intelligent Car Initiative. In view of the potential benefits that intelligent vehicle systems offer for road safety and the environment, the European Commission proposes new measures to introduce safer, cleaner and smarter vehicles to the market more quickly. It focuses, for instance, on the full-scale roll-out of the “eCall" system, and envisages the adoption, if necessary, of regulatory measures on the availability of electronic stability control (ESC) systems and systems for accident avoidance (ADAS). Provided they comply with Community legislation on taxes and State aid, incentives might also help towards the deployment of intelligent vehicle systems. The Commission also points to the importance of raising consumer awareness in order to create demand for smart vehicles.      Commission communication of 14 September 2005: “2nd eSafety communication – “Bringing eCall to citizens” [         COM(2005) 431        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      This communication on the roll-out of the       eCall system      is the second eSafety communication. eCall is a pan-European in-vehicle emergency call system which uses the European emergency number 112 in the event of an accident.     In this communication, the Commission calls on national and regional authorities to carry out the actions and investments necessary for the functioning of eCall. The document also presents the roadmap agreed between the stakeholders to ensure the complete roll-out of the system in 2009.      Commission communication of 15 September 2003: “Information and Communications Technologies for Safe and Intelligent Vehicles” [         COM(2003) 542        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      In this       first eSafety communication      , the Commission proposes the systematic use of ICT to design safer and smarter vehicles. For this, it proposes three categories of action: promoting intelligent vehicle safety systems, adapting the regulatory and standardisation provisions, and removing the societal and business obstacles.      Commission communication of 2 June 2003: “European Road Safety Action Programme – Halving the number of road accident victims in the European Union by 2010: A shared responsibility” [         COM(2003) 311        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      The ultimate objective of the       Road Safety Action Programme (2003-2010)      is to reduce by at least 50 % the number of people killed on the roads by 2010. For this, the programme proposes a range of measures such as stepping up road checks, deploying new road safety technologies, improving road infrastructure, and measures to improve the behaviour of road users.      Commission White Paper of 12 September 2001: “European transport policy for 2010: time to decide” [         COM(2001) 370        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      This       White Paper      seeks to develop a modern and sustainable transport system for 2010.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 – common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Aviation Safety Agency   summary    what does this regulation do  Its main aim is to set out the main rules and principles to establish and maintain a high uniform level of civil aviation safety in Europe, including the creation of a  European Aviation Safety Agency  (EASA).  Common safety rules offer a uniform level of requirements for operators*, manufacturers and aviation personnel. This in turn enables the free movement of products, persons and services in the EU market and allows for mutual recognition by EU countries of certificates*. This reduces the administrative burden and workload for the national authorities and the industry.  The regulation also seeks to:   ensure a high level of  environmental protection,    facilitate  free movement  of goods, persons and services,   promote  cost-efficiency  in the regulatory and certification* processes.   key points   This EU law applies to the design, production, maintenance and operation of aeronautical product parts and equipment, as well as to personnel and organisations involved in these activities.  One of the main means of achieving the above objectives is through the establishment of  EASA  . The law sets out the tasks, internal structure, working methods and final requirements of the Agency.  The main  tasks  of EASA include:   adopting opinions on civil aviation safety in Europe,   supporting the  European Commission  on measures to implement the law including those relating to technical matters such as construction and design,   conducting inspections and investigations necessary for it to fulfil its tasks.   Regarding  internal structure  , the law sets out the main rules of the agency including legal status, the powers and composition of the Management Board, and the powers and functions of the Executive Director.

summary of   Directive 2008/114/EC — identification and designation of European critical infrastructures and assessment of the need to improve their protection   what is the aim of the directive  It establishes a European Union (EU) process for identifying and designating European critical infrastructures  *  (ECIs), and sets out an approach for improving their protection.   key points   Identification and designation of ECIs   EU countries go through a process of identifying potential ECIs, with the help of the  European Commission  if required. When identifying potential ECIs, they should use:    cross  -  cutting criteria  such as possible casualties, economic effects and effect on the public; and    sectoral criteria  specific to the type of ECI.     EU countries go through a cooperative designation process (e.g. discussions with other EU countries) for potential ECIs located on their territory.   EU countries regularly review the identification and designation of ECIs.   The directive applies only to the energy and transport sectors (see Annex I of the directive). In time, other sectors may be added to its scope.   Operator security plans   EU countries ensure that an  operator security plan  (OSP) is in place for each ECI.   The purpose of the OSP process is to identify the critical assets of the ECI, as well as the existing security solutions for protecting them.    Security liaison officers    EU countries ensure that a security liaison officer is designated for each ECI.   The officer serves as the contact point between the owner/operator of the ECI and the EU country’s authority concerned.    Reporting    EU countries conduct  threat assessments  in relation to ECIs within 1 year following the designation of critical infrastructure.   EU countries report general data to the Commission on the types of risks, threats and vulnerabilities every 2 years.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 12 January 2009. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 12 January 2011.   background    National authorities are predominantly responsible for the protection of critical infrastructure. However, disruptions to critical infrastructure can be felt across national borders. That is why an EU dimension to help manage these risks is needed. In 2007, the Council of the EU adopted conclusions on a  European programme for critical infrastructure protection (EPCIF)  . This programme aims to improve the protection of critical infrastructures against all types of threats and hazards.   Following a review of Directive 2008/114/EC, the Commission, in 2013, set out a new  approach  towards implementing the European programme for critical infrastructure protection. This aims at building common tools and a common approach in the EU to critical infrastructure protection and resilience, taking better account of interdependencies between critical infrastructures, industry and state actors.   For more information, see:   ‘  Critical infrastructure  ’ on the European Commission's website.     * key terms     Critical infrastructure:  assets or systems essential for the maintenance of vital social functions, health, safety, security, and economic or social wellbeing of people. European critical infrastructure (ECI) is critical infrastructure in EU countries whose disruption or destruction would have a significant impact on at least 2 EU countries (e.g. electricity power plants or oil transmission pipelines).
   Administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax (until 31.12.2011)     Administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax (until 31.12.2011)     The European Union (EU) has introduced a common system of administrative cooperation and information exchange for EU countries to ensure proper application of value added tax (VAT) and to combat fraud.     ACT     Council Regulation (EC) No       1798/2003      of 7 October 2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No       218/92      [       See amending act(s)      ].     SUMMARY     This regulation determines the conditions of cooperation between national authorities responsible for applying value added tax (VAT) legislation on:      supplies of goods and services;       intra-Community acquisition of goods;       importation of goods.      It also provides a structure for cooperation between these national authorities and the Commission.     More precisely, the regulation lays down rules and procedures to enable the competent authorities of European Union (EU) countries to cooperate and to exchange any information that may help them assess VAT correctly.      Definition of parties concerned and procedures      Each EU country designates a single central office to act as a point of contact for administrative cooperation. The competent authorities of EU countries may designate liaison departments and/or competent officials for direct exchanges of information. The central liaison offices are responsible for maintaining up-to-date lists of these departments or officials and making them available to the other EU countries concerned.     Liaison departments and competent officials are required to inform their central liaison office when they send or receive a request for assistance or a reply to a request for assistance. They must also notify their central liaison office and competent authority of any request for assistance received that requires action outside their territorial or operational area.     The obligation for EU countries to assist each other does not cover the provision of information or documents obtained by the authorities when acting with the authorisation or at the request of a judicial authority, unless provided for in their national law.      Exchange of information on request      This concerns       requests for information and for administrative enquiries      sent by the competent authority of one EU country (the requesting authority) to the competent authority of another EU country (the requested authority) to obtain information that may help with the correct assessment of VAT. The requested authority has the obligation to provide the information requested. To that end, it may make administrative enquiries and act for the requesting authority as if it were acting on its own behalf.     The requesting authority may make a reasoned request for an administrative enquiry. In such cases, the requested authority must justify any failure to carry out the enquiry.     The requesting authorities must use a standard form for all requests for information and administrative enquiries.     As regards the       time limit for providing information      , the requested authority must provide the information without delay and no later than three months following the date of receipt of the request. However, if the requested authority is already in possession of the information, the time limit is reduced to a maximum of one month. In certain cases, the requesting and requested authorities may agree on different time limits.     If the requested authority is unable to respond to the request by the deadline, it must immediately inform the requesting authority in writing of the reasons for its failure to do so and indicate a timeframe within which it will be able to respond.     The requesting and requested authorities may agree to allow officials of the first to be       present in the administrative offices      of the latter. The officials of the requesting authority may also       participate in the administrative enquiries      with a view to exchanging information, but never to exercise the powers of inspection conferred on the officials of the requested authority. They must at all times be in possession of a written authority, which states their identity and official capacity.     EU countries may also agree to conduct       simultaneous controls      in their respective territories on the tax situation of taxable persons, if this is more effective than controls carried out by only one EU country.      Exchange of information without prior request      The competent authority of an EU country must forward information by automatic or structured automatic exchange to the competent authority of the EU country concerned when:      tax is meant to be charged in the EU country of destination and the effectiveness of the control system depends on information from the EU country of origin;       an EU country believes that a breach of VAT legislation has or might have been committed in the other EU country;       there is a risk of tax loss in the other EU country.      The exact categories of information to exchange, the frequency of exchanges and the practical procedures for exchanging information are determined by the Commission, assisted by a standing committee on administrative cooperation. In addition, each EU country must determine whether it will take part in the exchange of a particular category of information and whether it will do so in an automatic or structured automatic way.     The competent authorities of EU countries may forward to each other any information of which they are aware by spontaneous exchange.      Storage and exchange of information relating to intra-Community transactions      Each EU country must maintain an electronic database in which it stores and processes information relating to VAT. It is the responsibility of each EU country to ensure that its database is complete, accurate and kept up to date.     The competent authority of an EU country can obtain directly from any other EU country, or have direct access to, data stored on:      VAT identification numbers issued by the EU country receiving the information;       the total value of all intra-Community supplies of goods and services to persons holding a VAT identification number by all operators identified for the purposes of VAT in the EU country providing the information.      If necessary for the control of intra-Community acquisition of goods and supply of services to prevent a breach of VAT legislation, the competent authority of an EU country must receive directly, or have direct electronic access to, the following information:      the VAT identification numbers of the persons who effected the intra-Community supplies of goods and services;       the total value of such supplies to persons holding a VAT identification number.      EU countries must provide access to the information without delay and no later than one month from the end of the period to which the information relates.      Conditions governing the exchange of information      The requested authority may refuse a request for assistance. In such cases, it must always inform the requesting authority of its reasons. Requests for assistance may be refused if the provision of information:      imposes a disproportionate administrative burden;       is contrary to the laws or administrative practices of the requested EU country;       leads to the disclosure of commercial, industrial or professional secrets;       is against public policy.      Information communicated on the basis of this regulation is covered by the obligation of official secrecy and is protected under the national law of the EU country that received it. Therefore, this information may only be used for clearly specified purposes, such as:      establishing the assessment base;       collection or administrative control of tax (for the purpose of establishing the assessment base);       assessment of other levies, duties and taxes covered by Article 2 of Council Directive         76/308/EEC        ; and       in connection with judicial proceedings that may involve penalties, initiated as a result of infringements of tax law (the documents may be invoked as evidence).       Context      This regulation belongs to a series of tax harmonisation measures taken to complete the internal market.     In the interests of facilitating contacts between local and/or national tax authorities to combat fraud more effectively, this regulation brings together into a single legal instrument and reinforces the provisions of the Directive on       mutual assistance by competent authorities in the field of direct and indirect taxation      and the Regulation on       administrative cooperation in the field of indirect taxation      .     On 7 October 2010, the Council adopted       Regulation (EU) No 904/2010      which repeals the current Regulation on 1 January 2012. However, chapter V (with the exception of Article 27, paragraph 4) remains applicable until 31 December 2012. Certain provisions from the new Regulation entered into force on 1 November 2010, others will apply from 1 January 2012 and 1 January 2015.

   Eligibility of expenditure of operations part-financed by the Structural Funds     Eligibility of expenditure of operations part-financed by the Structural Funds     The Regulation establishes common rules at Community level on eligible expenditure for certain types of operations part-financed by the Structural Funds. The objective is to guarantee the uniform and fair implementation of the Structural Funds across the Community in 2000-06.     ACT     Commission Regulation (EC) No       1685/2000      of 28 July 2000 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No       1260/1999      as regards eligibility of expenditure of operations co-financed by the Structural Funds [Official Journal L 193 of 29.07.2000] [See amending acts].     SUMMARY     Where eligibility of expenditure is concerned, the general Regulation on the Structural Funds stipulates that the relevant national rules are to apply to eligible expenditure unless the Commission deems it necessary to adopt common rules.     The Regulations establishing the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) specify the types of operation that they may help to part-finance.     Expenditure is eligible when it is incurred between the date when eligibility commences (the date on which the Commission receives the grant application) and the final date of eligibility (fixed in the Commission Decision granting a contribution from the Funds).     These common rules on eligible expenditure apply to the following forms of assistance from the Funds: operational programmes (OPs), single programming documents (SPDs), Community Initiative programmes (CIPs), technical assistance and innovative actions. They do not affect which Fund can part-finance an operation. Moreover, Member States are always free to adopt stricter national provisions.      ELIGIBILITY RULES       Rule No 1 - Expenditure actually incurred      As a general rule, the       final beneficiaries      are the bodies or public or private firms directly responsible for commissioning the operation concerned. In the case of State aid schemes and aid granted by bodies designated by the Member States, the final beneficiaries are the bodies which grant the aid to the individual recipients.     Payments by final beneficiaries (advance payments, intermediate payments and payments of the balance) are cash payments accompanied by receipted invoices or accounting documents of equivalent probative value. This provision is without prejudice to clauses in contracts signed under public procurement procedures and complies with the special rules applying to investment in the forestry sector. In some specific cases, other costs and contributions may be included in the payments by final beneficiaries:      Depreciation      :     The cost of depreciation of real estate or equipment counts as eligible expenditure provided that national or Community grants have not contributed towards their purchase, and provided the cost complies with accounting standards and relates to the part-financing period of the operation concerned.      Contributions in kind      :     Contributions in kind count as eligible expenditure if they involve the provision of land or real estate, equipment or materials, research or professional activity, or unpaid voluntary work.     Such contributions must be valued by an independent expert or organisation. The value of unpaid voluntary work is assessed on the basis of the amount of time spent and the normal hourly and daily rate for the work carried out.      Overheads      :     Overheads count as eligible expenditure provided that they are based on real costs and allocated pro rata to the operation, according to a duly justified fair and equitable method.     Payments into venture capital, loan and guarantee funds are treated as expenditure actually paid out.     Expenditure relating to subcontracts is not eligible where the contracts concerned result in an increase in the cost of implementing the project with no corresponding added value, or are with intermediaries or consultants paid a percentage of the total cost of the project.      Rule No 2 - Accounting treatment of revenue      Revenue may be derived from sales, rentals, services, enrolment fees or other equivalent receipts. It reduces the amount of the contribution from the Structural Funds. No later than at the closure of the assistance, revenue must be deducted from the eligible expenditure of the part-financed operation, either in full or in part depending on whether it was generated entirely or only in part by that operation.      Rule No 3 - Financial and other charges and legal expenses      Except in the case of global grants, interest on debts (other than expenditure on interest subsidies to reduce the cost of borrowing for businesses in the context of a State aid scheme), charges for financial transactions, exchange costs and other purely financial costs are not eligible for part-financing by the Structural Funds. Nor are fines, financial penalties and expenditure on disputes.     Conversely, the Structural Funds may part-finance the bank charges for opening and administering an account and the costs of legal advice, lawyers' fees, technical or financial expertise, accounting and audit. The same rules apply to trans-national financial transactions under the Peace II programme and the Interreg III, Leader+, Equal and Urban II Community Initiatives after deduction of the interest received on advance payments.      Rule No 4 - Purchase of second-hand material      The purchase of second-hand equipment is eligible provided the seller of the equipment provides a declaration stating its origin and confirming that at no point during the previous seven years has it been purchased with the aid of national or Community grants. The price of the equipment may not exceed its market value or the cost of similar new equipment. The equipment must have the technical characteristics necessary for the operation.      Rule No 5 - Purchase of land      The purchase of land which has not been built on is eligible for part-financing by the Structural Funds provided the transaction does not represent more than 10% of the total eligible expenditure of the operation. There must be a direct link between the purchase and the objectives of the operation. A qualified independent expert or an official body must confirm that the price of the land does not exceed the market value.     For environmental conservation operations, the managing authority authorises the purchase of land and its use for a period specified in the light of the operation's objectives. Under no circumstances may such land be used for agricultural purposes. The purchase must be made by or on behalf of a public institution or a body governed by public law.      Rule No 6 - Purchase of real estate      Real estate means buildings that have already been built and the land on which they are built. The purchase of real estate is eligible if there is a direct link between the purchase and the objectives of the operation. The building may not have received a national or Community grant within the previous ten years. A qualified independent expert or an official body must confirm that the price of the land does not exceed the market value.      Rule No 7 - VAT and other taxes and charges      In general, VAT counts as eligible expenditure only if it is genuinely and definitively borne by the final beneficiary (or by the individual recipient in the context of a State aid scheme) and if Directive       77/388/EEC      has been complied with. Whether the final beneficiary or the individual recipient is a public or private body does not affect whether the VAT is eligible.     Other taxes, levies and charges (in particular direct taxes and social security contributions on wages and salaries) arising from part-financing by the Structural Funds are not eligible unless they have been genuinely and definitively borne by the final beneficiary (or by the individual recipient in the context of a State aid scheme).      Rule No 8 - Venture capital and loan funds      Venture capital funds, venture capital holding funds and loan funds are investment tools set up specifically to provide equity or other forms of risk capital, including loans, to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). They are set up as independent legal entities governed by agreements between the shareholders, or as separate blocks of finance within an existing financial institution.     These funds are eligible for part-financing by the Structural Funds, whose participation may be accompanied by co-investments or guarantees from other Community financing instruments. Under no circumstances can the Commission become a partner or shareholder.     The part-financers or sponsors of funds must submit a prudent business plan specifying, among other things, the targeted market, the appropriations, the terms and conditions of financing, the operational budget of the fund, the part-financing partners, the fund's by-laws, the independence of the management and the provisions for winding up the fund. The managing authority must evaluate such business plans carefully.     Funds may invest only in the establishment, early stages (seed capital) or expansion of SMEs, and only in activities which are judged to be economically viable. They may not invest in firms in difficulty. Moreover, the contribution of such funds is subject to the ceilings laid down in the general Regulation on the Structural Funds.     When the operation is closed, the eligible expenditure of the fund (the final beneficiary) is the capital that has been invested in or loaned out to SMEs, including the management costs incurred. Management costs may not exceed 5% of the paid-up capital on a yearly average.     The Commission recommends (but does not insist on) the following standards of good practice:      the financial contribution of the private sector should be substantial, and above 30%;       in principle, funds should not hold a majority stake in firms;       funds should cover a wide enough target population to ensure that their operations are economically viable;       the credibility and professionalism of the fund's management team must be impeccable.       Rule No 9 - Guarantee funds      Guarantee funds are financing instruments that guarantee venture capital, loan funds and other risk financing schemes against losses arising from their investments in SMEs. Such funds may be mutual funds subscribed by SMEs, commercially-run funds with private-sector partners, or wholly publicly-financed funds. Participation by the Structural Funds' should be accompanied by part-guarantees provided by other Community financing instruments.     Like venture-capital and loan funds, guarantee funds are set up as independent legal entities and the Commission may not become a partner or shareholder. The part-financers or sponsors of these funds must submit a prudent business plan. Any part of the Structural Funds' contribution left over after the guarantees have been honoured must be reused for SME development activities in the same eligible area.     When the operation is closed, the eligible expenditure of the fund (the final beneficiary) is the amount of the paid-up capital of the fund necessary, on the basis of an independent audit, to cover the guarantees provided, including the incurred management costs, which may not exceed 2% of the paid-up capital on a yearly average.      Rule No 10 - Leasing      Expenditure incurred in the context of leasing operations is eligible for part-financing by the Structural Funds on the following terms:      Aid granted to the lessor:      The lessor is the direct recipient of the Community part-financing, which is used to reduce all the leasing rentals made by the lessee for the duration of the leasing period for the assets covered by the leasing contract.     The expenditure eligible for part-financing is the purchase of the asset by the lessor, the amount of must be lower than the market value of the rented asset. Other costs connected with the leasing contract (tax, lessor's margin, interest refinancing costs, overheads, insurance charges, etc.) are not eligible expenditure.      Aid granted to the lessee:      The lessee is the direct recipient of the Community part-financing. Rent paid to the lessor is eligible for part-financing by the Member States. However, other costs connected with the leasing contract, (tax, lessor's margin, interest refinancing costs, overheads, insurance charges, etc.) are not eligible.      Sale and lease back:      Leasing rental paid by a lessee under a sale and lease-back scheme may count as eligible expenditure.      Rule No 11 - Costs incurred in managing and implementing the Structural Funds      As a general rule, the costs incurred in the management, implementation, monitoring and inspection of the Structural Funds are not eligible for part-financing. However, on certain conditions, exceptions can be made for expenditure:      relating to the preparation, selection, appraisal and monitoring of assistance and of operations, except for expenditure on the acquisition and installation of computerised systems for management, monitoring and evaluation;       on meetings of monitoring committees and sub-committees relating to the implementation of assistance, including the costs of experts and third-country participants;       relating to audits and on-the-spot checks.      Expenditure on salaries, including social security contributions, is eligible only for civil servants or other staff seconded to carry out the tasks referred to above and eligible for Community assistance.     In the context of general assistance from the Structural Funds (Objective 1 , Objective 2 , Objective 3), Community part-financing of expenditure on implementation, monitoring and inspection depends on the total amount of assistance and is subject to the following ceilings: (a) 2.5% where the total contribution is less than or equal to 100 million, (b) 2% where the total contribution is between 100 million and 500 million, (c) 1% where the total contribution is between 500 million and 1 billion, and (d) 0.5% where the total contribution is more than 1 billion. For the Community Initiatives, the special programme Peace II and innovative actions, the ceiling is 5% of the total contribution.     Technical assistance measures (studies, seminars, information measures, evaluation and the acquisition and installation of computerised systems for management, monitoring and evaluation) are not subject to ceilings.      Rule No 12 - Eligibility of operations depending on the location      As a general rule, operations part-financed by the Structural Funds should be located in the eligible region. Exceptions can be made in cases where a region concerned by a measure will benefit wholly or partly from an operation located outside that region. In such cases, the operation must be located in a NUTS III area immediately adjacent to the eligible region. The maximum eligible expenditure is then calculated pro rata to the expected benefits (at least 50%), but may not exceed 10% of total expenditure on the measure or 5% of the total expenditure on assistance.     In the case of operations financed by the FIFG or relating to the most remote regions, eligibility for part-financing is subject to the Commission's approval. The evaluation will take account in particular of the proximity of the operation to the region, the expected benefit to the region and the amount of the expenditure in proportion to the total expenditure under the measure.

summary of   Directive 2000/59/EC on port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues   summary    what does the directive do  It enhances the availability and use of port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues.  It also sets out a regime of enforcement, including a system for inspections and for the exchange of information.   key points   The directive covers:   all ships, regardless of their flag, which arrive at the port of an EU country, excluding warships and ships belonging to or operated by a state for non-commercial governmental purposes;   all ports within EU countries normally used by these ships.   EU countries must ensure that port reception facilities:   meet the needs of the ships using the ports without causing excessive delay;   are tailored to the size of the port and to the categories of ship calling there, since larger ports tend to have greater traffic and larger ships.    Waste reception and handling   A waste reception and handling plan must be drawn up in each port. These plans must be approved and assessed by the EU country concerned. The plans must be re-approved at least every 3 years.   Notification   Captains of ships (other than fishing boats and recreational craft authorised to carry no more than 12 passengers) bound for an EU port are required to notify certain information, in particular:   the date and the last port in which ship-generated waste was delivered;   the types and amounts of waste and residues to be delivered and/or remaining on board and the percentage of maximum storage capacity.    Delivery   Ship-generated waste must be delivered to a port reception authority before leaving an EU port, unless the captain can prove that the vessel has sufficient dedicated storage capacity to reach the intended port of delivery. However, in this case, an EU country can still require ships to deliver their waste before leaving the port if it has reasonable grounds to believe that:   the intended port does not have adequate facilities; or   the intended port is not known;   and therefore there is a risk that the waste will be deposited at sea.    Inspections   There is a 25 % minimum inspection requirement for ships operating in an EU port. EU countries must pay particular attention to ships which:   have not complied with the notification requirement;   are suspected of not having delivered their waste in accordance with the directive.    Waste fees   Ports must establish  cost recovery systems  to encourage the delivery of waste on land and discourage dumping at sea. All ships calling at an EU port will bear a significant part of the cost (set at 30 % by the  European Commission  ) irrespective of the actual use of the facilities. The fees may differ depending on the category, type and size of the ship. The fees may also be reduced if the master of the ship can demonstrate that the ship’s environmental management, design, equipment and operation produces reduced quantities of ship-generated waste.   Implementation   A final evaluation study published in 2015 by the Commission on the implementation of the directive found that it had been partially effective, efficient and coherent. It also identified a number of issues that could be addressed in a review of the directive.   from when does this directive apply  It has applied since 28 December 2000. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 28 December 2002.   background   The protection of the marine environment can be enhanced by reducing discharges into the sea of ship-generated waste and the remnants of cargo material.

   Community financial aid to trans-European networks     Community financial aid to trans-European networks     Trans-European network policy depends on financial instruments being available to support projects with the highest trans-European added value. This regulation establishes the conditions and procedures for granting Community aid to projects of common interest in the field of trans-European networks for transport, energy and telecommunications.     ACT     Regulation (EC) No       67/2010      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 November 2009 laying down general rules for the granting of Community financial aid in the field of trans-European networks.     SUMMARY     This regulation establishes the conditions and procedures for granting Community aid to projects of common interest in the field of       trans-European networks for infrastructures in the fields of telecommunications, transport and energy      .     Community aid may only be granted to projects of common interest. Parts of projects are also eligible when they form units which are technically and financially independent.     Community aid for projects can take one or more of the following forms:       co-financing of studies        related to projects – except in exceptional cases, the Community contribution may not exceed 50% of the total cost of a study;        subsidies of the interest on loans        granted by the European Investment Bank or other public or private financial bodies;        contributions towards premiums for loan guarantees        from the European Investment Fund or other financial institutions;        direct grants to investments        in duly justified cases;        risk-capital participation for investment funds        with a focus on providing risk capital for trans-European network projects and involving substantial investment from the private-sector.      At least 55% of the funding for transport infrastructure projects should be allocated to railways (including combined transport) and a maximum of 25% to roads.      Conditions for financial aid      Community aid may be granted if the following conditions are fulfilled:      there is a financial obstacle to the achievement of a project;       the Community aid must not exceed the minimum necessary for the launch of a project;       except in exceptional circumstances, the total amount of Community aid must not exceed 10% of the total investment cost;       the Community aid must not, in principle, be granted to projects benefitting from other sources of Community funding.      The Commission may establish an       indicative multiannual programme      by sector to improve the efficiency of the European Union (EU). The programme will consist of projects of common interest in specific fields which require substantial funding over a long period of time. The programme must be reviewed, and if necessary revised, with regard to the effective progress of the projects.      Project selection criteria      Community aid is intended for projects that are       potentially economically viable      and for which the financial profitability at the time of application is deemed insufficient. The decision to grant Community assistance should also take account of:      the         maturity        of the project;       the         stimulative effect        on public and private finance;       the         soundness        of the financial package;        direct or indirect socio-economic effects        , especially on employment;       the         environmental consequences        .      In particular in the case of cross-border projects, coordination between the various parts of the project must be taken into consideration.      Applications for financial aid      Applications for funding must be submitted to the Commission by the EU country concerned or, with the agreement of the EU country, by the body directly concerned. This regulation stipulates the information required for the assessment and identification of applications, including a provisional timetable and a description of control measures to be put in place by the EU country concerned over the use of the requested funds.      Reduction, suspension and cancellation of aid      The Commission may reduce, suspend or cancel aid for a project if, after examination, there is an       irregularity      or a       failure to comply      with one of the conditions, or a       significant change in the nature of the project      for which the Commission’s approval was not requested.     Except in exceptional circumstances, approved aid will be cancelled by the Commission if the project has not started within two years following the expected start date. The Commission may demand reimbursement of any aid paid if the project in question has not been completed within ten years.      Funding      The financial framework for the implementation of this regulation for the period 2000 to 2006 is EUR 4 874 880 000.

   Executive Agency for Health and Consumers     Executive Agency for Health and Consumers     The Executive Agency for Health and Consumers supports the Commission in the management of Community programmes and measures in the fields of health, consumer policy and training in matters of food safety.     ACT     Commission Decision       2008/544/EC      of 20 June 2008 amending Decision 2004/858/EC in order to transform the “Executive Agency for the Public Health Programme” into the “Executive Agency for Health and Consumers”.     SUMMARY     The Executive Agency for Health and Consumers was established on 20 June 2008 under Regulation 58/2003 laying down the       statute      for European Union executive agencies. It replaces the Executive Agency for the Public Health Programme (PHEA). It was established in Luxembourg for the period 1 January 2005 until 21 December 2015.     The Agency is responsible for implementing the programmes of Community action in the field of health       2003-2008      and       2008-2013      , the programme of Community action in the field of       Consumer policy for 2007-2013      and food safety training measures, with regard to the legislation on       foodstuffs, animal feeds, animal health and animal welfare      , as well as       plant health rules      .     The detailed tasks of the Agency were defined in the Commission decision delegating authority to the Agency adopted on 9 September 2008. Its general mission is to:      manage and supervise the life cycle of the projects;       adopt the instruments of budget implementation and implement the programmes and measures;       produce reports to help the Commission evaluate the programmes and measures.       Function and management      Management of the Agency is provided by a Steering Committee of 5 members and a director. The Commission shall appoint them for a renewable term of office for two years and four years respectively. The Agency is accountable to the Commission for the programmes’ performance.      Finance      For its running costs the Agency receives subsidies entered in the general budget of the European Communities. They are distributed from the funds allocated to the Public Health Programme 2008-2013, the Consumer Programme 2007-2014 and the food safety training measures.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 595/2009 on type-approval of motor vehicles and engines (with respect to emissions from heavy-duty vehicles and access to vehicle repair and maintenance information)   what is the aim of the regulation   It defines the rules for type-approval of motor vehicles, engines and replacement parts for heavy-duty vehicles (lorries, buses and coaches) with respect to their emission performance. It also establishes rules on:   in-service conformity of vehicles and engines;   durability of pollution-control devices;   on-board diagnostic (OBD) systems;   accessibility of vehicle OBD and vehicle repair and maintenance information;   measurement of fuel consumption and CO  2  emissions.     It repeals Directives  80/1269/EEC  ,  2005/55/EC  and  2005/78/EC  with effect from 31 December 2013.   Regulation (EU)  2018/858  (see  summary  ), which applies from  1 September 2020  , amends Regulation (EC) No 595/2009 by removing the references in it regarding access to  vehicle OBD and vehicle repair and maintenance information  .   key points    Scope   This regulation applies to motor vehicles of categories M  1  , M  2  , N  1  and N  2  with a reference mass exceeding 2,610 kg and to all motor vehicles of categories M  3  and N  3  as defined in Annex II of Directive  2007/46/EC  (see  summary  ).   Manufacturer obligations   Manufacturers must:   be able to demonstrate that all new vehicles, engines or spare parts sold, registered or put into service in the EU have been type-approved in accordance with this regulation;   implement technical measures to guarantee effective limitation of exhaust-pipe emissions throughout the normal life of the vehicles under normal conditions of use.    Requirements and tests   Manufacturers must equip their vehicles or engines with components that ensure compliance with the emission limits laid down in Annex I of this regulation under conditions specified by the  European Commission  in this regulation and in the implementing acts.   Access to information    Manufacturers must:   guarantee  independent operators  (i.e. businesses which are independent from authorised dealers and repairers of a given vehicle brand) access to information on OBD systems and on diagnostic equipment, tools or software;   provide a  standardised, secure and remote facility  to enable independent repairers to complete operations which involve access to the vehicle security system.     The information should be made available on  manufacturers' websites  , or, if this is not feasible, in another appropriate format.   It should be noted, however, as of  1 September 2020  , all rules relating to  vehicle repair and maintenance information  will be found in  Chapter XIV  of Regulation (EU) 2018/858.    Timetable   National authorities must no longer grant EU or national type-approval for vehicles that do not comply with this regulation as from 31 December 2012. They must prohibit the registration of new vehicles that do not comply with this regulation as from 31 December 2013.   Financial incentives    Countries may grant financial incentives for the  purchase of motor vehicles produced in series  which comply with this regulation until 31 December 2013.  Retrofitting measures  may also be considered either to adapt in-use motor vehicles or for scrapping.   The amount of the financial incentives must be equal to the additional cost of the technical measures introduced to ensure compliance of the vehicle with emission limits.    Implementing legislation    Implementing acts  contain measures to implement Regulation (EC) No 595/2009:   Commission Regulation (EU) No  582/2011  sets out the  specific technical requirements  for the approval of heavy-duty vehicles with regard to emissions and access to vehicle repair and maintenance information.   Commission Regulation (EU)  2017/2400  (see  summary  ) complements the legal rules established by Regulation (EU) No 582/2011. It lays down the rules for:    certifying truck components  with an impact on CO  2  emissions and the fuel consumption of vehicles;   issuing  licences to perform simulations  to determine CO  2  emissions and fuel consumption of new vehicles to be sold, registered or put into service in the EU;    operating simulation tools  and  declaring the CO  2  emissions and fuel consumption values  that they determine.     from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 7 August 2009. However, some of the amendments to Directive 2007/46/EC included in Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 595/2009 have applied since 31 December 2013.   background   The  Seventh Environment Action Programme  highlights the need to reduce air pollution. This regulation contributes to its objectives in terms of air quality by establishing a system which constrains the automobile industry to limit the emissions from the vehicles that it produces.  For more information, see:    Reducing CO  2  emissions from Heavy-Duty Vehicles  (  European Commission  ).   main documents   Regulation (EC) No  595/2009  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2009 on type-approval of motor vehicles and engines with respect to emissions from heavy-duty vehicles (Euro VI) and on access to vehicle repair and maintenance information and amending Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 and Directive 2007/46/EC and repealing Directives 80/1269/EEC, 2005/55/EC and 2005/78/EC (OJ L 188, 18.7.2009, pp. 1-13)  Successive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 595/2009 have been incorporated into the original text.

   Instrument for Stability (2007 – 2013)     Instrument for Stability (2007 – 2013)     The European Union (EU) leads external cooperation actions aimed at supporting the stability of third countries. The measures financed by the Instrument for Stability shall contribute to the preparedness for responding to natural or man-made disasters, and to rehabilitating countries following a disaster or a situation of instability.     ACT     Regulation (EC) No       1717/2006      of the Parliament and of the Council of 12 November 2006 establishing an Instrument for Stability.     SUMMARY     The Instrument for Stability finances cooperation actions for development and for financial, economic and technical cooperation led by the European Union (EU) in partnership with third countries. These actions aim to:      re-establish stability in emergency situations, situations of crisis or emerging crisis in order to enable the effective implementation of development and cooperation policies;       strengthen the capacity of third countries to prepare for crises and global and transregional threats.      In the case of       crisis or emerging crisis situations      , including situations which could evolve into armed conflict, the Instrument for Stability contributes to protecting democracy, law and order, the safety of individuals, human rights and fundamental freedoms.     The cooperation actions can also support:      the technical and logistical measures of state and non-state actors, and regional and international organisations;       establishing interim administrations;       the development of democratic public institutions and independent judiciaries;       national and international criminal courts and national reconciliation commissions;       the demobilisation and reintegration of former combatants into civil society and measures to address the situation of child soldiers and the rehabilitation of victims;       the development of civil society and the promotion of independent media;       reducing the impact on the civilian population of anti-personnel landmines and unexploded ordnance or explosive remnants of war;       the promotion of equal access to natural resources;       the response to natural or man-made disasters and threats to public health.      In cases where the situation of the country offers       stable cooperation conditions      , the Instrument for Stability can contribute, in particular, to:      improving the preparedness for crisis, in terms of response and rehabilitation;       strengthening the public institutions and infrastructures, including with regard to combating terrorism and organised crime and improving the security of critical infrastructure and public health;       mitigating the risks connected to chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear material or agents.       Implementing the aid      The aid provided must take into account the actions led by the other European instruments for external assistance.     The implementation of the fund is based on geographical and thematic strategy documents, and on the multi-annual indicative programmes for each country. Special measures may also be adopted in response to exceptional crises or situations.      Beneficiaries of the funding      Several types of actors can receive funding from the Instrument for Stability, whether they are in the EU or in third countries. They may be local, regional or national authorities in the partner countries, international organisations, public or private organisations, non-governmental organisations and natural persons.      Context      The provisions of the Instrument for Stability repeal and replace the regulations concerning the rapid reaction mechanism and the different regulations concerning combating anti-personnel landmines.

   Obligation of air carriers to communicate passenger data     Obligation of air carriers to communicate passenger data     This Directive requires air carriers to collect and transmit passenger data to the authorities of the Member State of destination responsible for control. Non-compliance may lead to fines being imposed and even, in the case of serious infringement, confiscation of the means of transport or withdrawal of the operating licence.     ACT     Council Directive       2004/82/EC      of 29 April 2004 on the obligation of carriers to communicate passenger data.     SUMMARY     According to this Directive, air carriers       *      are required to communicate information concerning their passengers travelling to a European Union (EU) border crossing       *      . This information is supplied, at the request of the authorities responsible for carrying out checks       *      on persons at the external borders       *      of the EU, to improve border control and to combat illegal immigration more effectively.     These data are forwarded to these authorities for passenger registration purposes. In principle they are transmitted electronically to these authorities.     Carriers are required to transmit the following information: number and type of travel document used, nationality, name and date of birth of the passenger, border crossing point of entry into the EU, departure and arrival time of the transportation, total number of passengers carried.     In principle, these data are deleted by these authorities within 24 hours of transmission, provided that the passengers have arrived within the territory of the Member States. The personal data are deleted by the carrier within 24 hours of arrival of the means of transport.     Member States must adopt dissuasive, effective and proportionate sanctions, should carriers fail to comply with this obligation. Such sanctions are applicable to carriers which, as a result of fault, have not transmitted data or have transmitted incomplete or false data. The maximum amount of these sanctions is not less than EUR 5000 and their minimum amount is not less than EUR 3000 for each journey.     Member States may also provide for other types of sanctions in the event of serious infringement of the communication requirement. These sanctions may consist of:      immobilisation, seizure and confiscation of the means of transport;       temporary suspension or even withdrawal of the carrier's operating licence.      Carriers may appeal against measures imposed against them. Member States adopt all the necessary measures for this right of appeal to be effective.      Background      This Directive was adopted following a request by the European Council of 25 and 26 March 2004, which met following the terrorist attacks in Madrid. The obligations provided for in this Directive are complementary to those laid down by Article 26 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, as supplemented by Council Directive       2001/51/EC      , concerning the       obligation of carriers to return third-country nationals      who are refused entry by the Member State of destination.       Key terms used in the act         Carrier: any natural or legal person whose occupation it is to provide passenger transport by air.         External borders: external borders of the Member States with third countries.         Border control: check carried out at a border exclusively on account of crossing that border.         Border crossing point: any crossing point authorised by the competent authorities for crossing external borders.

summary of   Directive 2002/14/EC – general framework for informing and consulting employees in the EU   what is the aim of the directive  It establishes general principles on the minimum information  *  and consultation  *  rights for employees in companies based in the European Union (EU). National legislation and industrial relations’ practices determine how these are applied.   key points    EU countries may:   choose whether the legislation applies to companies with at least 50 or establishments with at least 20 employees   establish special rules for companies essentially involved in political, professional organisational, religious, charitable, educational, scientific or artistic aims   determine that employers do not need to inform or consult employee representatives where this would seriously harm the company’s operation.

   Employment policy guidelines (2008-2010)     Employment policy guidelines (2008-2010)     The guidelines proposed by the Commission should direct the coordination of European Union (EU) Member States’ policies towards an objective of employment and sustainable growth.     ACT     Council Decision       2008/618/EC      of 15 July 2008 on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States.     SUMMARY     Employment guidelines are one of the three pillars for the Integrated Guidelines for 2008-2010. They add to the Broad Economy Policy Guidelines (       BEPG      ) 2008-2010 which cover macroeconomic policies and national microeconomic reforms.     Member States should adopt policies that enable full employment, improve quality and productivity at work, and strengthen social and territorial cohesion (       Guideline No 17      ). By adhering to these priorities by 2010, the European Union (EU) should achieve an employment rate of 70 % overall, of at least 60 % for women and of 50% for older workers (55 to 64).     The Commission proposes three priority fields of action for growth and employment:       Attract more people in employment, increase labour supply and modernise social protection systems       Considering the ageing of the European population, employment policies should be better adapted to different stages in the lifecycle (       Guideline No 18      ). Action should encourage longer working lives and       active ageing      , whilst ensuring the modernisation and viability of social protection systems (including pensions and health). Appropriate policies should also ensure that youth unemployment is reduced in accordance with the aims of the       Youth Pact      . In addition, female participation should be increased by ensuring gender equality. Policies should ensure that work and family life is better coordinated, by developing childcare services and care for other dependants.     The European labour market should be inclusive and strengthen work attractiveness in particular for job-seekers. It should be a factor for social inclusion (       Guideline No 19      ). To this end       active inclusion      measures should be implemented, early and equally. As should incentives and disincentive measures related to tax and benefit systems. New jobs should be developed in services for individuals and businesses.     Matching of labour market needs (       Guideline No 20      ), can be improved through the modernisation of national labour market institutions, in particular by ensuring greater transparency of the dissemination of employment and training opportunities and better anticipation of labour shortages. It is also essential to encourage intra-European mobility, and to better reap the benefits of immigrant labour.       Improve adaptability of workers and enterprises to the economic situation       In order to better respond to economic and social changes, the labour market should be more flexible and more homogenous, whilst guaranteeing employment security (       Guideline No 21      ). Member States should integrate these objectives into their national legislation, and promote innovative forms of work organisation. They should anticipate economic changes in order to reduce their social costs and to facilitate workers’ occupational transitions.     Labour cost developments and wage-setting mechanisms should be employment-friendly (       Guideline       No 22      ). Social partners should implement frameworks for salary negotiation which take into account productivity and labour market objectives. Whilst the tax burden on the low-paid should be reduced.       Invest in human capital through better education and skills       Investment in human capital (       Guideline No 23      ) should be increased. This should be achieved through inclusive policies for education and training at all levels. Also by reducing the number of early school leavers. Strategies should be adopted for       lifelong learning      , and these can be supported in particular by financial incentives.     Education and training systems should be better adapted to new needs in terms of qualifications (       Guideline No 24      ). The openness and quality of these systems should be guaranteed, as should the diversity of training opportunities and possibilities for mobility. Education and training should be accessible to all, in particular through working time organisation, vocational guidance and cost sharing. Non-formal and informal education should be better recognised and validated.

These recommendations are intended to enable Member States to improve the implementation of the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs (cycle 2008-2010). They concern both economic policy guidelines and employment policy guidelines.     These recommendations are specific to the economic and social situation of each State and take account of the slowdown resulting from the international financial crisis.     Member States are to modify their national reform programmes and to give an account of their actions in the annual reports on the implementation of those programmes.      Council Decision         2009/536/EC        of 7 July 2009 on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States.

summary of   Directive 2006/116/EC on the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights   what is the aim of the directive  It seeks to harmonise the term of protection of  copyright   *  and certain  related rights   *  .  It  codifies  and repeals Directive  93/98/EEC  which harmonised the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights.   key points   The term of protection of copyright for a  literary or artistic work  is set at  70 years  from:   the death of the author of the work, or the death of the last surviving author in the case of a work of joint ownership;   the date on which the work was lawfully made available to the public if it is anonymous or was produced under a pseudonym.   The term of protection for a  film or audiovisual work  is set at  70 years  after the death of the last survivor among the following:   the principal director;   the author of the screenplay;   the author of the dialogue; and   the composer of music specifically created for use in the film or audiovisual work.   The directive was amended by Directive  2011/77/EU  which extended the length of protection for  music recordings  . This was because performers often start their careers early, and the term of 50 years for  fixations of performances  , such as recordings, did not protect their performances for the full extent of their lifetime. Thus it extends the rights of performers and phonogram producers on music recordings from  50 to 70 years  .  Directive 2011/77/EU also harmonises the way of calculating the term of protection for songs, and other musical compositions with words, created by several authors. The term of protection expires  70 years  after the death of the  last person to survive  (i.e. of the author of the lyrics or the composer of the music).   Related rights   The term of protection of related rights (film producers and broadcasting organisations) is  50 years  . This is calculated on a case-by-case basis from the date of the performance, the publication or communication of its fixation. The term of protection of performers and phonogram producers was extended to 70 years by Directive 2011/77/EU.   Calculating terms   The term of protection begins simultaneously in all EU countries. It is calculated from 1 January of the year following the event giving rise to it.   Protection of works originating in non-EU countries   If the work originates in a non-EU country and the author is not an EU national, the protection granted in the EU ends at the final date of protection in the country of origin, but must not exceed the term set in the EU.   Notification   EU countries must communicate to the  European Commission  immediately any plans for new related rights.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 16 January 2007.  The Directive 2006/116/EC  codifies  and replaces Council Directive  93/98/EEC  which had to become law in the EU countries by 1995.   background   For more information, see:    EU copyright legislation  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Copyright:  protects the interests of creators by giving them property rights over their creations or works.   Related rights:  these protect the legal interests of persons and bodies who either:   contribute to making works available to the public; or   produce subject matter which, although it does not qualify as ‘works’ under the copyright systems of all countries, expresses creativity or technical and organisational skill sufficient to justify recognition of a copyright-like property right.
summary of   Directive 1999/35/EC — system of mandatory surveys for the safe operation of regular ro-ro ferry and high-speed passenger craft services   summary    what does this directive do  It provides for mandatory surveys of regular roll-on-roll-off (ro-ro) ferries* and high-speed passenger craft using EU ports to ensure that they satisfy applicable safety standards.   key points    The legislation applies to all ro-ro ferries and high-speed passenger craft using EU ports, regardless of their flag, when operating international or domestic journeys.   EU countries must ensure that, before they start operating a service, the ferries and vessels:   carry valid certificates, which have been verified;   comply with the relevant classification standards;   are fitted with a voyage data recorder (VDR);   satisfy specific stability requirements.     Companies operating the services must ensure that measures, such as information on shore-based navigational guidance systems, are available on board the vessels.   EU countries must:   carry out an initial inspection before the start of a regular service to ensure necessary safety standards are met;   carry out subsequent inspections twice a year and after any repairs or change of management, one of the two annual inspections should be an inspection during a regular service;   prevent a vessel from operating if it does not comply with the safety standards;   in the event of an accident or casualty involving a vessel covered by this directive, cooperate in the investigation with any country which has a substantial interest.     Related legislation on  port state control  aims to outlaw substandard shipping in the EU. It requires all vessels to comply with EU and international safety standards, as contained in the  International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS)  for instance.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied from 1 June 1999. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 1 December 2000.   key term   *  ro-ro ferry  : a seagoing passenger vessel with facilities to enable road or rail vehicles roll on and roll off, and carrying more than 12 passengers.   act   Council Directive  1999/35/EC  of 29 April 1999 on a system of mandatory surveys for the safe operation of regular ro-ro ferry and high-speed passenger craft services (OJ L 138, 1.6.1999, pp. 1-19)  Successive amendments to Directive 1999/35/EC have been incorporated in the original text.

   URBAN II     URBAN II     1) OBJECTIVE     To lay down Commission guidelines on the economic and social regeneration of cities and neighbourhoods in crisis in order to promote sustainable urban development.     2) ACT     Commission Communication of 28 April 2000 to the Member States laying down guidelines for a Community initiative concerning economic and social regeneration of cities and of neighbourhoods in crisis in order to promote sustainable urban development Urban II [C(2000) 1100 - Official Journal C 141 of 19.05.2000].     3) SUMMARY     Almost 80 % of the European Community's citizens today live in cities. As centres of cultural, political, social and economic exchange and development, towns and cities play a crucial role in Europe. Accordingly, urban issues are at the heart of the Community's policies. This can be clearly seen in the Commission's       guidelines      on the programming of mainstream Structural Fund assistance (       Objective 1      ,       Objective 2      ,       Objective 3      )     The Urban Community Initiative, first launched in 1994, encourages urban areas and neighbourhoods in crisis to design innovative, integrated urban development measures. The fruits of these measures are now beginning to be seen in the areas concerned: the quality of life is improving and local stakeholders agree on the importance of the integrated Urban approach. Thus, during the 1994-99 programming period, the Urban Community Initiative provided funding for 118 urban areas, amounting to EUR 900 million and directly benefiting 3.2 million people.     Between 1989 and 1999, the innovative actions of the European Regional Development Fund (       ERDF      ) encouraged urban development and experimentation with new forms of economic, social and environmental development, with encouraging results. EUR 164 million funded 59 urban pilot projects (       UPP      ).     Encouraged by these positive experiences, the Commission decided to continue this approach. Broadly speaking, it wished to see greater account taken of urban issues in all the Community's policies. In particular, it introduced Urban II, the new Community initiative for sustainable urban development, in the       general regulation      on the Structural Funds.     Urban II is jointly financed by the Commission and the Member States. For 2000-06, the Community's contribution to the initiative amounts to EUR 730 million, exclusively from the ERDF, for a total investment of EUR 1.6 billion, covering a population of some 2.2 million. Community financing can fund up to 75 % of the total eligible cost in urban areas covered by Objective 1 and 50 % elsewhere.      Objectives      The Urban II Community initiative offers added value to mainstream programmes. It is important to stress the innovative nature of the operations involved, which start life as demonstrative, flagship actions before gradually being incorporated into the mainstream programmes.     The objectives of the new Community initiative are:       to formulate and implement innovative strategies        for sustainable economic and social regeneration of small and medium-sized towns and cites or of distressed urban neighbourhoods in larger cities;        to enhance and exchange knowledge and experience        in relation to sustainable urban regeneration and development in the areas concerned.      In order to fulfil these objectives, the urban regeneration strategies must adhere to the following principles:       sufficient critical mass of population and associated support structures        to facilitate the formulation and implementation of innovative urban development programmes;        strong local partnership        to define challenges, strategy and priorities, allocate resources and monitor and evaluate the strategy. Partnerships are wide and include economic and social partners, non-governmental organisations and residents' groupings;        an integrated territorial approach        linked to development strategies for the wider urban area or region;        integration of the economic, social and environmental        , security and transport aspects, including equality of access to education and training opportunities;       promotion of         equal opportunities between men and women        ;       complementarity with the main forms of assistance under the Structural Funds and other Community initiatives (         Interreg III        ,         Leader+        ,         Equal        ).       Eligible areas      Urban II is providing support for 70 urban areas. The population in each area should be around 20 000 people, but may be as few as 10 000 in some cases.     To be eligible, each city, town or urban neighbourhood must be a coherent geographical or socio-economic entity. These areas are in a situation of urban crisis or in need of economic and social regeneration. Located either within or outside areas eligible for support under Objectives 1 and 2 of the Structural Funds, they must meet at least three of the following conditions:      a low level of economic activity and a specific need for conversion due to local economic and social difficulties;       a high level of long-term unemployment, poverty and exclusion;       a low level of education, significant skills deficiencies and high drop-out-rates from school;       a high number of immigrants, ethnic and minority groups, or refugees;       a high level of criminality and delinquency;       precarious demographic trends;       a particularly degraded environment.      On the basis of indicative       financial allocations      , and an indicative number of urban areas per Member State and a minimum level of expenditure (EUR 500 per inhabitant), the Member States identify the urban areas wishing to participate in Urban II. Each area selected defines a development strategy which it works out in a Community Initiative Programme (CIP). This document becomes the basis for negotiating financial assistance from the Commission and serves to implement the innovative urban development strategy on the ground.      Priority activities      The strategies develop high impact operations which must maximise the visibility of the selected areas both within Member States and at Community level. They also show commitment to organisational change in urban governance by means of increased delegation of powers and participation by all stakeholders. Strategies also have the following priorities:       mixed use redevelopment of brownfield sites        : protection and restoration of buildings and public spaces, reclamation of derelict sites and contaminated land; preservation and enhancement of historic, cultural and environmental heritage; creation of lasting jobs; integration of local communities and ethnic minorities; reintegration of excluded persons; improved security and prevention of delinquency; improved street lighting, closed circuit TV surveillance; reduced pressures on greenfield sites.The ERDF cannot finance housing. However, the CIPs can still help, with support from national and/or local authorities for housing improvement when housing is part of the urban crisis;        entrepreneurship, employment pacts and local employment initiatives        : support and services for small and medium-sized enterprises, commerce, cooperatives and mutual associations; creation of business centres, technology transfer facilities; training for new technologies; encouraging entrepreneurship; environmental protection; provision of cultural, leisure and sports amenities; nursery and crèche facilities; alternative care facilities and other services namely for elderly people and children; promotion of equal opportunities between men and women;        the development of an anti-exclusion and anti-discrimination strategy through actions furthering equal opportunities        and targeting notably women, immigrants and refugees: counselling, training schemes and language training oriented to the specific needs of minorities and disadvantaged and marginalised people; mobile units for employment and training advice; improved health services and drug rehabilitation centres; investment in education and health facilities;        development of more effective, economically efficient and environmentally friendly integrated public transport systems        : safer, more integrated and more intelligent public transport; public transport links to concentrations of activity and jobs; telematic services for travel information, reservation and payment; clean and energy-efficient vehicles; provision for cycling and walking; training for transport staff;        environmental measures        : minimising and treatment of waste, total recycling, selective collecting and treatment; air quality analysis; efficient water management; noise reduction; reduction in consumption of fossil fuels through use of renewable energy sources; training in environmental management and protection;        development of the potential of information society technologies        targeting small and medium-sized enterprises and citizens: better access to services of public interest, education, culture and other telematic neighbourhood services; training and installation of facilities to allow teleworking; information systems for the management of human resources and health services; assistance to adapt to the labour market; supporting local authorities for the transfer of know-how and technology;        promoting the notion of "urban governance"        : studies and expertise on the reorganisation and improvement of public services; design and introduction of new urban management structures; introduction of indicators for evaluating the sustainability of local management; information campaigns and improved access to information for citizens; measures to involve citizens in the political decision-making process; exchanges of experiences and good practice; development of the European Union database on good practice in urban management.      Exchanging experience and good practice with regard to urban development and the economic and social regeneration of urban areas is a key component of the Urban II Community Initiative. This exchange of information will be facilitated by developing methods for quantification and appropriate performance indicators, which could be inspired by the       Urban Audit      . A maximum amount of EUR 15 million is earmarked for developing networks to this end. Other technical assistance measures can be planned at the initiative of the Commission or the Member States. The funds committed for exchange of experience and good practice and technical assistance may amount to no more than 2 % of the total ERDF contribution.      Community Initiative programmes      The local authorities of the eligible areas, where necessary in collaboration with the regional and national authorities, draw up a Community Initiative programme (CIP) to implement an innovative urban development strategy. Each programme concerns a coherent geographical and socio-economic urban area. In some cases, it may even concern several urban areas, each of which covers at least 10 000 hectares and belongs to the same territorial context.     All the general rules laid down in the general Regulation on the Structural Funds apply to CIPs. Their content is similar to that of the single programming documents (SPDs) and includes:      an         ex ante        evaluation analysing the strengths and weaknesses of the area concerned;       a description of the programming process and the arrangements made to consult the partners;       a statement of the strategy and priorities for the development of the urban area in accordance with the general Community guidelines;       a summary description of the measures planned to implement the priorities and required to prepare, monitor and evaluate the CIP;       an indicative financing plan for each priority and each year;       the provisions for implementing the CIP: the authorities and structures set up (managing authority, monitoring committee and, where applicable, paying authority and steering committee); arrangements for managing the CIP (calls for proposals, selection of operations); arrangements for financial control, monitoring, checks and evaluation.      The selected authorities must present their Community Initiative programmes to the Commission within six months following the publication of the Communication. Within three months of the approval of the programmes, a programming complement must be sent to the Commission, unless the Member State opts to apply for a global Community grant.      Monitoring, implementation and evaluation of interventions      The managing authority is responsible for organising the preparation of decisions to be taken by the monitoring committee and, where the steering committee. In particular, it accepts, considers and gives a preliminary assessment of operations proposed for financing or coordinates such tasks.     The monitoring committee, which meets at least once each year, is made up of representatives of the local, and possibly also the national and regional, authorities, the economic and social partners and non-governmental organisations. The committee is responsible, in particular, for monitoring and evaluating the programme and making changes to it.     For more information, please see the specific page dedicated to the       Urban II      Community Initiative on the Internet site of the Directorate-General for Regional Policy.      4) implementing measures       Initially, the Commission had planned to support some 50 urban areas, but in the end 70 were selected. For more information, please see the         press releases        covering the approvals of all the programmes.       5) follow-up work        Commission Communication of 14.06.2002 to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on "The programming of the Structural Funds 2000-2006: An initial assessment of the Urban Initiative" [           COM(2002)308          final - Not published in the Official Journal].        Urban issues are assuming increasing political importance in the European Union. The Urban approach teaches a number of lessons for the future of European policy: an integrated approach, focusing on relatively small areas, with some flexibility in the selection of areas according to national requirements and priorities, with simplified and flexible administration and local partnership.

   Instrument for structural policy for pre-accession     Instrument for structural policy for pre-accession     In order to prepare for the accession of the candidate countries from Central and Eastern Europe (CEECs), the European Union provides, through the structural pre-accession instrument, financial support in the area of economic and social cohesion, and in particular for environment and transport policies for the period 2000 - 2006.     ACT     Council Regulation (EC) No       1267/1999      of 21 June 1999 establishing an Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-accession [       See amending acts      ]     SUMMARY     The Commission communication on       Agenda 2000      calls for measures to reinforce the pre-accession strategy for all the applicant countries in Central and Eastern Europe for the period 2000-06. This implies the establishment, by way of back-up for the       Phare      programme and aid for agricultural development, of a structural instrument for pre-accession (ISPA) (replaced by the instrument for pre-accession assistance -       IPA      - for the period 2007-2013).      Eligible Measures      Community assistance granted under ISPA is limited to programmes for the environment and transport.      Environment      Community financial assistance is granted to environmental projects that enable the beneficiary countries to comply with the requirements of Community       environmental law      and with the accession partnerships.      Transport      ISPA assistance is granted for transport infrastructure measures. The projects concerned promote sustainable mobility and above all      are of common interest based on the criteria laid down in         Council Decision No 1692/96        (on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network);       enable the beneficiary countries to comply with the objectives of the accession partnerships. This includes interconnection and interoperability between national networks and the trans-European networks, as well as access to such networks.      The total cost of each measure cannot, in principle, be less than 5 million.     A balance must be struck between measures in the field of the environment and measures relating to transport infrastructure. Assistance may also be granted for:      preliminary studies related to eligible measures;       technical support measures, including information and publicity actions.      The selection and approval of projects are based on national transport and environmental programmes. These programmes are included in the national programme for the adoption of the Community       acquis      , which is one of the key elements of the accession partnerships.      Financial arrangements      An indicative allocation between beneficiary countries of the total Community assistance under ISPA is made by the Commission on the basis of the criteria of population, per capita GDP in purchasing power parities, and surface area.      Forms and rate of assistance      The rate of Community assistance granted under ISPA may be up to 75% of public or equivalent expenditure. The Commission may decide to increase this rate to up to 85%, in particular where it considers that a rate higher than 75% is required to implement projects essential for achieving the general objectives of ISPA. Preliminary studies and technical support measures may be financed in exceptional cases at 100% of the total cost.      Compatibility with other Community policies      Measures financed under ISPA comply with the provisions set out in the Europe Agreements, including the implementing rules on state aid.     The Commission is responsible for coordination and consistency between those measures and measures financed by other contributions from the Community budget, for instance in respect of cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation, by the       European Investment Bank      .      Appraisal and approval of measures      The Commission adopts decisions on the measures to be financed under ISPA on the basis of applications for assistance submitted by beneficiary countries. Commission decisions approving measures determine the amount of financial assistance and lay down a financing plan together with all the provisions necessary for the implementation of the measures.      Management and control      The applicant countries are responsible for implementing projects under Commission supervision. In implementing the Regulation, the Commission ensures that the principles of sound financial management are adhered to.      Monitoring and evaluation      Monitoring of ISPA is carried out jointly by the beneficiary country and the Commission. More specifically, monitoring is carried out by reference to physical and financial indicators relating to the specific character of the project and its objectives.

act   Council Decision  94/358/EC  of 16 June 1994 accepting, on behalf of the European Community, the Convention on the elaboration of a European Pharmacopoeia.   summary   On 22 July 1964, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom (   1   ) signed a Convention, drawn up under the aegis of the Council of Europe, on the elaboration of a European Pharmacopoeia.  The objectives are to harmonise specifications for medicinal substances of general interest to the population of Europe and to hasten the drawing-up of specifications for the growing number of new medicinal substances appearing on the market.  These objectives are met by creating a European Pharmacopoeia comprising monographs which become official standards applicable in the territories of the countries which are Contracting Parties to the Convention.  On 16 November 1989 a Protocol to this Convention was signed in order to enable the European Community to accede to it. It entered into force on 1 November 1992.  The European Pharmacopoeia currently has 38 European members, including the European Union (EU). The 37 member countries are:   the EU-15, namely Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom (   1   );   three of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries, namely Iceland, Norway and Switzerland;   the thirteen most recent Member States of the EU, namely Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Bulgaria and Romania;   the four EU candidate countries, namely the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey;   Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Ukraine.   The European Pharmacopoeia also has 26 observers, including the World Health Organisation (WHO). The 25 observer countries are:   six European countries, namely Albania, Republic of Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Moldova and the Russian Federation;   nineteen non-European countries, namely Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Canada, China, Israel, Madagascar, Malaysia, Morocco, Republic of Guinea, Senegal, Singapore, South Africa, Syria, the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (TFDA) of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Tunisia and the United States.   The elaboration of the European Pharmacopoeia is undertaken by two bodies:   the European Pharmacopoeia Commission, which prepares and adopts the technical decisions relating to monographs. It comprises eminent scientists appointed by each Contracting Party and chosen for their competence in certain fields;   the Public Health Committee of the Council of Europe, which exercises administrative authority over the Commission's activities and sets the date of application of the monographs but cannot interfere with their technical content.

   Testing migration of plastic materials in contact with foodstuffs     Testing migration of plastic materials in contact with foodstuffs     The basic rules necessary for testing migration of constituents of plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs are harmonised at European level. Migration is the quantity of material, in this case plastic, which can be transferred to foodstuffs in contact with the plastic and which is likely to constitute a danger to human health and alter the composition of the foodstuffs in an unacceptable manner.     ACT     Council Directive       82/711/EEC      of 18 October 1982 laying down the basic rules necessary for testing migration of constituents of plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     The following text contains a consolidation of existing Directives relating to testing migration of constituents of plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs (Directives       82/711/EEC      , 93/8/EEC and 97/48/EC).     The basic rules necessary for testing migration are included in the Annex to Directive       97/48/EC      . The Annex also explains that migration tests may be carried out using simulants.     Verification of compliance of migration into foodstuffs shall be carried out under the most extreme conditions of time and temperature foreseeable in actual use. For food simulants verification shall be carried out using conventional migration tests, the basic rules for which are described in Directive       93/8/EEC      .     The Directives lay down the procedure to be followed in cases where, for a given plastic material or article, the basic rules for migration tests are inappropriate.      Migration limit, lists of approved substances and simulants      The limit on overall migration and the list of substances approved within the scope of this Directive are stipulated in Directive       2002/72/EC      (see "Related acts" below). The list of simulants for testing migration is found in Directive       85/572      (see "Related acts" below).      Background      European legislation (Directive       2002/72/EC)      protects consumers' health by banning materials and articles in contact with foodstuffs which may transfer their constituents to foodstuffs in quantities which could endanger human health and by prohibiting substantial changes to foodstuffs, including their organoleptic characteristics. (Changes to organoleptic characteristics are permitted only in active materials if the substance is an       additive that is authorised      in foodstuffs).     The latest scientific progress has led to innovations concerning articles in contact with foodstuffs.       Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004      authorises two types of packaging: "intelligent" (indicating if the product has expired or deteriorated) and "active" (making chemical changes to foodstuffs to increase their durability).

It repeals Directive       90/128/EEC      .      Commission Directive         93/10/EEC        of 15 March 1993 relating to materials and articles made of regenerated cellulose film intended to come into contact with foodstuffs      Most recently amended by:      Directive         2004/14/EC        [Official Journal L 27 of 30.01.2004]       Directive         85/572/EEC        [Official Journal L 372 of 31.12.1985]      This is a measure implementing Directive       82/711/EEC      .     The Annex lists and stipulates the concentration of food simulants authorised for testing migration. Thus, prior legislation on plastic packaging is applied while taking account of technical progress in migration testing.     Last updated: 08.08.2006  
summary of   Regulation (EC) No 551/2004 — organisation and use of the airspace in the single European sky (the airspace Regulation)   what is the aim of the regulation   Part of a package of legislation on air traffic management to establish the Single European Sky under Regulation (EC) No  549/2004  (see  summary  ), the regulation seeks to optimise the use of European airspace, thus reducing delays and promoting the growth of air transport.   The regulation was amended by Regulation (EC) No  1070/2009  in view of the plan to extend the competences of the  European Union Aviation Safety Agency  to include air traffic management safety. This amendment permits the  European Commission  to update measures due to technical or operational developments, as well as to lay down the basic criteria and procedures for the exercise of certain network management functions.   key points    Creation of the Single European Sky   This seeks to:   provide tools to manage fluctuations in air traffic capacity;   improve safety: ensure the same levels of safety are observed in air traffic control systems and procedures in all EU countries;   reduce the fragmentation of air traffic service provision: varying national approaches to air traffic management and its organisation lead to inconsistencies and shortcomings, with an adverse effect on the internal air transport market;   improve the integration of military systems into the organisation of air traffic control;   facilitate the introduction of new technology.    Network management and design   To support initiatives both on a national level and on the level of functional airspace blocks, air traffic management network functions will allow optimal use of airspace and ensure that airspace users can operate preferred trajectories, while permitting maximum access to airspace and air navigation services.   Flexible use of airspace   Coordination will be increased between the civilian and military authorities, in particular for the allocation and efficient use of airspace for military purposes, including the criteria and principles which should govern allocation and use, and in particular access for civilian flights.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 20 April 2004.   background   See also:    Single European Sky  (  European Commission  ).
summary of   Sanctions & measures against employers of illegally staying non-EU nationals – Directive 2009/52/EC   summary    what does this directive do  In order to counteract illegal immigration, it requires EU countries to prohibit the employment of non-EU nationals staying in the EU illegally.  It sets out minimum EU-wide rules on the penalties and other measures that can be applied against employers found to have breached this ban.   This directive does not apply to all EU countries - Denmark, Ireland and the UK (   1   ) have opted out.   key points    Employers’ obligations   Employers have to:   require non-EU nationals to produce a  residence permit  or another authorisation to stay before taking up employment    keep copies  of the permit or authorisation for the duration of the employment, in case of inspection by the national authorities    notify the authorities  within the period set by the EU country when they employ a non-EU national.   EU countries may also:   use a simplified notification procedure if the employer is an individual who engages a non-EU national for private purposes   decide not to require notification when the non-EU national has been granted long-term residence status.    Penalties   EU countries must ensure that employers who break these rules are subject to effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties, including:    fines  based on each illegally employed non-EU national    paying  for these nationals to be  returned  to their country of origin.   EU countries must also:   ensure that employers are liable for  back payments  , such as outstanding wages and social security contributions.   put in place  systems  to allow illegally employed non-EU nationals to claim any outstanding wages from their employers.   ensure employers are also – if appropriate – subject to other penalties, such as:   losing entitlement to some or all  public benefits  (including EU funding) for up to 5 years   having to  repay any benefits  received in the 12 months before the illegal employment was detected   being barred from participation in  public contracts  for up to 5 years   temporary or permanent closure of their business.      Criminal offences   An intentional infringement constitutes a criminal offence when the employer:   persists in not complying   employs a  significant number  of illegally staying non-EU nationals   employs such people in particularly  exploitative working conditions    employs victims of  human trafficking    illegally employs minors.    Complaints and inspections   Illegally employed non-EU nationals must be able to lodge complaints against their employers, either directly or through third parties. EU countries are required to carry out inspections based on regular risk assessments, to check whether employers are employing such illegal immigrants.   Implementation   Two main findings of a 2014  report  on the application of the directive were that:   there are differences in the  severity  of the punishment in different EU countries   there is room for improvement in all areas offering  protection  to irregular migrants.   from when does the directive apply  It applies from 20 July 2009. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 20 July 2011.   background    Irregular migration – EU policy.   act   Directive  2009/52/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2009 providing for minimum standards on sanctions and measures against employers of illegally staying third country nationals (OJ L 168, 30.6.2009, pp. 24–32)  Corrections to Directive 2009/52/EC have been incorporated in the basic text.

   Green Paper on Copyright and Related Rights in the Information Society     Green Paper on Copyright and Related Rights in the Information Society     The purpose of this Green Paper is to set out the background to a number of questions of copyright and related rights where legislative measures may be needed as the information society develops.     ACT     European Commission Green Paper of 27 July 1995 on Copyright and Related Rights in the Information Society [       COM(95) 382      final - Not published in the Official Journal]     SUMMARY     The Green Paper is divided into two chapters. Chapter 1 describes how the information society ought to function. It shows how important the information society is to the European Community, and how it fits into the single market framework. It seeks to highlight the issues that arise as a result of the emergence of the information society. Chapter 2 picks out nine of the points regarding copyright and related rights which were brought up in contributions from interested parties and which the Commission believes should be given priority in order to ensure that the information society can function properly.      Need for adapted regulations      If the information society is to develop successfully, the many new services and products being created must be able to benefit fully from the information superhighway. Their expansion must take place in a regulatory framework that is coherent at national, Community and international level. Legislation will have to be adapted in order to respond to the new requirements arising, and this raises new issues. One of these issues is the adaptation of the legal environment for intellectual property.     The Green Paper emphasises that the approach taken by the single market legislation shows the way forward in information society policy.      The importance of adequate protection      The new services and products being provided via the information superhighway may make use of existing works or may create new ones. Existing protected material will have to be regularly re-worked before being transmitted in a digital environment; and the creation of new works and services requires substantial investment, without which the scope of the new services will remain very limited.     The creative effort which provides a basis for investment in new services will be worth undertaking only if works and other matter are adequately protected by copyright and related rights in the digital environment.     Once a service has been provided on a network it becomes very difficult, without adequate protection, to ensure that a literary or artistic work or other protected matter will not be copied, transformed or exploited without the knowledge of the rightholders and contrary to their interests.      Network characteristics and difficulties for protection      Owing to the very nature of such networks, any wide variation in the level of protection of works and other protected matter may place obstacles in the way of the development of the information society. Given the difficulty of verifying the use made of a work, and the scope for displacement of business which this opens up, there is a need for more far-reaching harmonisation of the protection provided by copyright and related rights.      Current legal framework      There is already a measure of Community-wide harmonisation in the shape of four directives on copyright and related rights. This legal framework has to be completed with the Directive on the       legal protection of databases      . This last measure puts the Community ahead of its commercial partners by providing a proper legal framework for the development of services in the information society.      Better harmonisation      Copyright and related rights give the holder sole power to authorise or prohibit the use, reproduction and the like of works and other protected matter; and unless the rules governing them are aligned from one country to another, there will inevitably be obstacles in the way of the free movement of the goods and services involved. Moreover, unless there is sufficient harmonisation at Community level, the markets now opening up to new services risk remaining segmented between themselves; this would prevent the development of services which will be profitable only if they can operate in a market wider than the purely domestic one.     A number of general questions, questions concerning specific rights and some other issues arising in connection with the exploitation of rights should therefore be examined. The general questions concern the applicable law and the exhaustion of certain rights. The aspects of specific rights discussed include reproduction rights, the definition of "public" in connection with the right of communication "to the public", and certain specific rights which might be applicable to different types of digital transmission. Here it is proposed that a distinction should be drawn between a digital transmission right and a digital broadcasting right. The issue of moral rights is also examined in detail. On the exploitation of rights, the Green Paper looks at the administration of rights and at systems of identification and technical protection.     The Green Paper is part of a process of consultation. In 1995, interested parties, including organisations and governments, were able to present their views on the questions it raises.     RELATED ACTS      Directive         2001/29/EC        of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society [Official Journal L 167 of 22.06.2001].      This Directive aims to harmonise the laws of Member States on       copyright and related rights      in order to improve legal certainty and provide a high level of protection for intellectual property in the European Union.      Resolution on the Commission Communication "Follow-up to the Green Paper on copyright and related rights in the information society" [         COM(96)0483        C4-0621/96 - Official Journal C 339 of 10.11.1997].

summary of   Treaty on the European Atomic Energy Community   what is the aim of the treaty  As is clear from the wording of its Title II, the aim of the Euratom Treaty is to ‘encourage  progress in the field of nuclear energy  ’.  In particular, the objective is, within a  common nuclear energy market  :   to  promote research  ;   to  achieve security of supply  for all EU countries;   to establish a system for supervising the  peaceful use  of nuclear materials intended for civilian use and ensuring high common standards for  health and safety  .   key points    Scope   The treaty is strictly limited to  civilian (not military) uses  of nuclear energy.   Structure of the treaty   Title I sets out 8  tasks entrusted to Euratom  which Title II elaborates on with specific rules:   promote  research  , cooperation in research and exchange of technical information — a  Joint Research Centre  is established;   establish uniform  safety  standards to protect the health of workers and of the general public and ensure that they are applied;   facilitate  investment  and ensure, particularly by encouraging joint ventures, the establishment of the basic installations necessary for the development of nuclear energy;   ensure through a common supply policy that all users in the Community (now the EU) receive a regular and equitable  supply  of ores and nuclear fuels — a  Euratom Supply Agency  is established;    control  the appropriate (in particular, non-military) and peaceful use of nuclear materials — Euratom safeguards are ensured by dedicated inspectors, who carry out physical and accounting checks in all nuclear installations in the Community;   exercise a right of  ownership of some special fissile materials  (fissile materials are composed of atoms that can be split by neutrons in a self-sustaining chain-reaction to release enormous amounts of energy);   create a  common market  in specialised materials and equipment, with free movement of capital for investment in the field of nuclear energy and freedom of employment for specialists;   establish with other countries and international organisations such relations as will foster progress in the  peaceful uses of nuclear energy  .   Titles III and IV concern  institutions and finances  :   Euratom shares the same executive bodies with the EU since the  Merger Treaty  (1967). It already shared some  common institutions    The sharing of  powers  given to the institutions in the Euratom Treaty differ from those of the EEC bodies (now the EU bodies acting within the scope of the EU). The Parliament in particular has less control over Euratom, with only consultation powers (no co-decision).   The Euratom  Supply Agency  , a  specific Euratom body  , has legal personality and financial autonomy and is under the supervision of the Commission.   Since the Merger Treaty, Euratom also shares a single administrative  budget  with the EU institutions. The R&D expenditures under the Euratom Treaty are however kept under a separate budget.   The fifth and sixth titles deal respectively with general rules and rules relating to the initial period (setting up the institutions, initial application rules and transitional rules).  The treaty also includes five annexes dealing with:   the fields of research concerning  nuclear energy  referred to in  Article 4  of the treaty;   the  industrial activities  referred to in  Article 41  of the treaty;   the advantages which may be given to  joint undertakings  under  Article 48  of the treaty;   a  list of goods and products  subject to the provisions of Chapter 9 on the nuclear common market; and   the initial  research and training programme  referred to in  Article 215  of the treaty (article 215 was repealed in the current  version  of the treaty).   from when does the treaty apply  Signed on 25 March 1957, the treaty entered into force on 1st January 1958.   background   The Treaty on the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC, better  known as ‘Euratom’  ) was signed in Rome in 1957, alongside the treaty establishing the  European Economic Community (EEC)  , by the six  founding countries  of the  European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC)  . The EEC and EAEC treaties are sometimes referred to as  the ‘Treaties of Rome’  , while the ‘Treaty of Rome’ designates the EEC Treaty.  Unlike the EEC Treaty, no major changes have ever been made to the Euratom Treaty, which remains in force. In particular, Euratom has not merged with the European Union and therefore retains a  separate legal personality  , although it has the same membership.  Alongside the  Treaty on European Union (TEU)  and the  Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU)  , the Euratom Treaty forms part of the primary law of the EU as one of its active treaties.

summary of   Directive 2005/71/EC on a specific procedure for admitting non-EU scientific researchers   what is the aim of the directive   It introduces a special procedure for the entry and residence of nationals coming from non-EU countries to carry out a research project in the EU for a period of more than 3 months.   The procedure establishes approved research organisations as key actors in the immigration procedure, as they play a crucial role in the thematic assessment of the candidate and his/her research project.   key points   The directive applies to non-EU nationals, except where more favourable provisions apply under bilateral or multilateral agreements concluded between the EU, or the EU and its member countries, and one or more non-EU country.  It does not apply to:   applicants for asylum or subsidiary protection or under temporary protection schemes;   doctoral students conducting research relating to their theses as students (covered by  Directive 2004/114/EC  on the conditions of entry and residence of non-EU nationals for the purposes of studies, vocational training or voluntary service);   non-EU nationals whose expulsion has been suspended for reasons of fact or law;   researchers seconded by a research organisation to another research organisation in a different EU country.    Research organisations   Any research organisation wishing to host a researcher must first be approved by the EU country in which it is located. These authorisations are usually valid for a  minimum of 5 years  . Each year, every EU country must publish a list of approved research organisations.  Research organisations must sign a ‘hosting agreement’, a legal contract, with the researcher. It requires that:   the researcher undertakes to complete the research project;   the organisation agrees to host the researcher, subject to the researcher being issued with a residence permit.    Admission of researchers   EU countries must admit researchers if they:   present a valid passport or equivalent travel documents;   present a hosting agreement signed with a research organisation;   present a statement of financial responsibility issued by the research organisation;   are not considered to pose a threat to public policy, public security or public health.   EU countries must issue a residence permit for  1 year or more and renew it annually  . If the research project is scheduled to last less than 1 year, the residence permit must be issued for the duration of the project. Permits may be issued to a researcher’s family members for the same duration.   Holders of a residence permit  will be entitled to equal treatment with nationals as regards:   recognition of diplomas, certificates and other professional qualifications;   working conditions, including pay and dismissal;   social insurance as defined by national legislation;   tax concessions;   access to goods and services and the supply of goods and services made available to the public.    Procedure   Each EU country decides whether applications for residence permits are to be made by the researcher or by the research organisation.  Applications must be submitted in the researcher’s country of residence via the diplomatic or consular authorities of the EU country where he/she wishes to conduct the research.  EU countries, in their national legislation, may also provide for the possibility for applicants to apply from their territory.   Repeal   Directive (EU)  2016/801  repeals and replaces Directive 2005/71/EC with effect from 24 May 2018.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 23 November 2005. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 12 October 2007.   background   The mobility of researchers is a key element in the acquisition and sharing of knowledge. Simplifying entry and residence procedures for researchers from countries outside the EU can help achieve this.  For more information, see:    ‘Study, research or training’  on the European Commission's website   act   Council Directive  2005/71/EC  of 12 October 2005 on a specific procedure for admitting third-country nationals for the purpose of scientific research (OJ L 289, 3.11.2005, pp. 15-22)
summary of   Regulation (EU) 2016/796 on the European Union Agency for Railways   what is the aim of the regulation  It establishes the European Union Agency for Railways (the Agency). The Agency aims to:   contribute to the further development and effective functioning of a single European railway area;   guarantee a high level of railway safety and interoperability  *  ;   improve the competitiveness of railways.   The regulation is one of 3 legislative acts covering the technical aspects of the  fourth railway package  which aims to revitalise the rail sector and deliver a better quality of service and more choice to passengers. The regulation works alongside the  regulation on the interoperability of the railway system in the EU  and the  directive on railway safety  .   key points   The Agency’s main objectives for the EU rail system are:   developing a common approach to safety;   increasing the level of interoperability;   examining national railway rules in order to support national authorities acting in the fields of railway safety and interoperability; and   promoting the best procedures.    Railway safety   The Agency has several tasks with regard to rail safety including:   providing recommendations to the  European Commission  on common safety indicators, methods and targets; and on the system of certifications of bodies in charge of safety;   issuing, renewing, suspending and amending  single safety certificates  and cooperating with national safety authorities in that respect;   encouraging the exchange of information on safety-related accidents, incidents and near misses.    Interoperability   The Agency has a number of tasks designed to improve interoperability by reducing technical barriers. These include:   providing recommendations to the Commission to revise the technical specifications on interoperability (TSIs);   issuing authorisations for the placing on the market of railway vehicles and vehicle types. The Agency also has the power to renew, amend, suspend and revoke these authorisations;   approving European railway traffic management system (  ERTMS  ) trackside equipment.    National rules   The Agency is tasked with ensuring the conformity of national rules with essential railway safety and interoperability requirements. In particular it must:   examine both draft and existing national rules to ensure their conformity and that they do not result in any arbitrary discrimination;   manage a dedicated IT system containing national rules and acceptable national means of compliance.    ERTMS   The Agency acts as the system authority to ensure the coordinated development of the  ERTMS  within the EU, in accordance with relevant TSIs.   Single European railway area (SERA)   The Agency has a number of tasks related to the monitoring of SERA including:   performance and decision-making of national safety authorities;   notified conformity assessment bodies;   progress on rail safety and interoperability.   from when does it apply  It has applied from 15 June 2016 (with a 3-year transitional period for tasks related to authorisation, certification and ERTMS trackside approval).   background   For further information, see:    European Union Agency for Railways  ;    ‘Rail Transport: Landmark deal will deliver better rail services to passengers’  (European Commission press release).   * key terms     Interoperability:  the ability of a rail system to allow the safe and uninterrupted movement of trains which accomplish the required level of performance.
summary of   Directive 2014/45/EU on periodic roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers   what is the aim of the directive  It aims to improve road safety by setting minimum requirements for periodic roadworthiness tests of vehicles and trailers in the EU.   key points    Scope   The law applies to vehicles capable of more than 25 km/hour in the following categories:    passenger cars and light commercial vehicles  (categories M  1  and N  1  ): to be tested 4 years after the date when first registered, and thereafter every 2 years;   vehicles in category M  1  used as taxis or ambulances, buses or minibuses (M  2  , M  3  ), heavy goods vehicles (N  2  , N  3  ) and heavy trailers (O  3  , O  4  ): to be tested 1 year after first registration, and thereafter yearly;    fast tractors  with a design speed above 40km/h (T  5  ) and used commercially: to be tested 4 years after registration, and thereafter every 2 years.    Powerful motorcycles   Category L vehicles with an engine larger than 125 cm  3  will be tested from 2022 unless road safety statistics for the previous 5 years show that the same level of road safety could be achieved by alternative measures.   Roadworthiness tests prior to the due dates   In certain circumstances, vehicles may be required to undergo a test  before  the due dates:   after an accident;   where the holder of the registration certificate has changed;   on reaching 160,000 km;   in cases where road safety is seriously affected.    Exemptions   The following types of vehicle are exempted from roadworthiness tests:   vehicles of historic interest,   diplomatic vehicles,   vehicles used by the armed forces, police, customs, fire services or for agricultural and forestry purposes only, as well as   vehicles used exclusively on small islands.    Approved testing centres   Each EU country must have approved and compliant testing centres, while inspectors must meet competence criteria and be free from any conflict of interest.   Assessment of defects    Defects are classified as minor, major or dangerous, with minor defects insufficient to fail vehicles.   Where defects are dangerous, the use of the vehicle on public roads may be suspended until the fault is rectified.    Roadworthiness certificate   Where a vehicle already registered in another EU country is re-registered, its certificate must be recognised by other EU countries, even where ownership has changed. By 2021, testing centres will be required to share relevant information with the competent authority of their country.   European electronic vehicle information platform   The feasibility, costs and benefits of setting up a  European electronic vehicle information platform  are to be examined.   Fraud    To detect odometer fraud, data from the preceding test is to be made available to the inspectors.   Misrepresenting the distance a vehicle has covered is a punishable offence.    COVID-19 pandemic    Regulation (EU)  2020/698  lays down specific and temporary measures in view of the COVID‐19 outbreak concerning the renewal or extension of certain certificates, licences and authorisations and the postponement of certain periodic checks and periodic training in certain areas of transport legislation.   The regulation extends the time limits provided for in Directive 2014/45/EU with regard to:   roadworthiness tests which should have been be carried out between 1 February 2020 and 31 August 2020 by a period of 7 months;   roadworthiness certificates, which should have been be carried out between 1 February 2020 and 31 August 2020 by a period of 7 months;   where an EU country considers that the carrying out of roadworthiness tests or the certification thereof is likely to remain impracticable beyond 31 August 2020, due to the COVID-19-related measures that it has taken, it may submit a reasoned request to the European Commission by 1 August 2020 for an authorisation to extend the periods.That request may concern the period between 1 February 2020 and 31 August 2020 or the period of seven months, or both.     from when does the directive apply  The directive had to become law in the EU countries by 20 May 2017. EU countries have to apply the rules as of 20 May 2018.   background   For further information, see:    Road safety  (  European Commission  ).
act   Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council: Enlargement Strategy and Main Challenges 2013-2014. [  COM(2013) 700  final of 16.10.2013 - not published in the Official Journal].   summary   The European Commission's communication Enlargement Strategy and Main Challenges is accompanied by a set of more detailed annual reports on countries currently negotiating EU membership and on potential candidates.  The communication looks at the progress of membership negotiations with four candidate countries: the  Montenegro  ,  former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  ,  Serbia  and  Turkey  . It also reviews the situation with regard to  3 potential candidates  in the Balkans:  Albania  ,  Bosnia and Herzegovina  and  Kosovo  (this designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with  UNSCR 1244  and the  ICJ Opinion  on the Kosovo Declaration of Independence).  A short report was also prepared on  Iceland  whose government has decided to put negotiations on hold.  The communication confirms the  continuing relevance  of the Copenhagen criteria (  democracy, the rule of law, respect for fundamental rights, and a functioning market economy  ) as a basis for admission to EU membership.  It points out that the EU accession process is  more rigorous and comprehensive  than in the past. It stresses the vital need to  address the fundamentals first  .   The countries need to tackle issues such as  judicial reform  and the  fight against organised crime  and  corruption  early in accession negotiations. This ensures that reforms are deeply rooted and irreversible by the time accession takes place.    Strong democratic institutions  are also important and civil society needs to play a greater role; further progress is needed on electoral, parliamentary and public administration reforms.   More effort is needed to ensure that the principles of  freedom of expression  and the  rights of persons belonging to minorities  are respected in practice, not just enshrined in law.   As some of these countries are not fully-fledged market economies, the communication sets out proposals to strengthen their  economic governance  : the Commission's proposals include the introduction of national economic reform strategies and action plans for public financial management.    Market reforms  are vital to ensure sustainable growth and improve competitiveness. These should help the countries tackle the  economic fundamentals  first and meet the economic criteria for membership.   With a budget of €11.7 billion (current prices) for the 2014-2020 period, the  Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA II)  aims to support countries in preparing for membership. The allocation of these funds transforms the political priorities of the enlargement strategy into concrete actions (such as aligning candidate countries' laws with EU laws and standards).  Lastly, the paper recommends that  Albania  be granted the status of a candidate country on the understanding that it continues to take action in the fight against organised crime and corruption.  For further information, see the  European Commission's Directorate-General for Enlargement  website.
summary of   Regulation (EC) No 987/2009 on coordinating social security systems   what is the aim of this regulation   It is an implementing regulation which modernises and simplifies the rules for applying Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 on the  coordination of social security systems in the EU  .   In implementing Regulation (EC) No 883/2004, this regulation makes it easier for citizens to exercise their right to move freely in the EU for study, leisure or for professional reasons and guarantees that they are not disadvantaged in terms of social security.   It repeals and replaces Regulation (EEC) No  574/72  .   key points   The regulation strengthens cooperation between EU countries’ social security institutions  *  and improves the methods that they use to share information with one another.  The regulation is divided into 5 titles some of which contain several chapters:   Title I — General provisions    Chapter I  — definitions of various terms used in the regulation.   Chapter II  — rules on cooperation between EU countries’ social security institutions:   how institutions share data;   how claimants interact with the social security institutions;   the legal value of documents and supporting evidence issued in another EU country;   the provisional application of legislation and the provisional granting of benefits (where there is a difference of view between institutions in different countries) and   the provisional calculation of benefits and contributions.    Chapter III  — aspects such as arrangements between 2 or more EU countries:   preventing the overlap of benefits;   determining residence;   aggregating periods of insurance, employment, self-employment or residence completed under the laws of an EU country; and   how these should be added to those completed under the laws of another EU country (if applicable).    Title II — Determination of the legislation applicable   Under Title II, detailed rules are set out depending on which article (i.e. Articles 12 to 16) of Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 applies to the claimant (for example, Article 13 applies to people who are employed in 2 or more EU countries).   Title III — Special rules concerning the various categories of benefits    Chapter I  — Sickness, maternity and equivalent benefits (for example, conditions for meeting the costs of sickness benefits in kind as part of scheduled treatments, i.e. treatments for which an insured person goes to another EU country other than that in which he/she is insured or resident).   Chapter II  — Benefits in respect of accidents at work and occupational disease.   Chapter III  — Death grants.   Chapter IV  — Invalidity benefits and old-age and survivors’ pensions.

Following the COVID-19 outbreak and introducing measures to cope with the impact of the crisis, the European Commission adopted:    Communication from the Commission — Towards a phased and coordinated approach for restoring freedom of movement and lifting internal border controls — COVID-19    key terms    Social security institutions:  these include institutions responsible for sickness, maternity, invalidity, retirement, accidents at work, unemployment, family benefits, as well as pre-retirement schemes.
act   Communication from the Commission - Biomass action plan (  COM(2005) 628 final  of 7 December 2005).   summary   Biomass can help tackle climate change by lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Its use for heating, electricity generation and transport fuels can diversify the European Union’s (EU) energy supply and create growth and jobs. For its contribution to be effective, it must be produced in a sustainable manner.   what does the communication do  It sets out ways to increase the development of biomass energy by creating incentives for its use and removing obstacles to its production. It identifies measures to promote biomass in heating, electricity and transport. It addresses issues such as supply, financing and research. The action plan was a first step to highlight the industry’s importance.   key points   The communication led to further initiatives to promote biofuels.   Sustainability criteria  exist to ensure that the use of biofuels guarantees real carbon savings and protects biodiversity. They stipulate that biofuels:   must achieve greenhouse gas savings of at least 35 % compared to fossil fuels. This rises to 50 % in 2017;   cannot be grown in areas with previously high carbon stock such as wetlands and forests;   cannot be produced from raw materials harvested from biodiversity-rich land.    Voluntary schemes  verify whether producers comply with the sustainability criteria. If they do, they are eligible for financial support or their output counts towards national renewable targets.   Procedures for permits:  practical recommendations provide help and advice to project developers, NGOs and public authorities when handling requests to build biomass plants.  The  European advanced biofuels flight path  aims to promote biofuels as a renewable fuel alternative for aircraft.   background   Biomass is derived from organic material such as trees, plants and agricultural and urban waste. Its production involves a chain of activities from growing of feedstock to final energy conversion. In 2012, biomass and waste accounted for some two thirds of all renewable energy consumption in the EU.  For more information, see the European Commission’s  biomass website.
   Green Paper on maintenance obligations     Green Paper on maintenance obligations     The European Union (EU) wishes to standardise legislation and procedures concerning maintenance obligations. To this end, the Commission has adopted a green paper that looks at the problem of settling cross-border disputes in this area. It launches a debate on how to develop Community law on the basis of current developments in international private law.     ACT     Commission Green Paper of 15 April 2004 on maintenance obligations [       COM(2004) 254      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Under international private law, disputes relating to maintenance obligations       *      are mainly governed by the Hague Conventions. These conventions lay down the conflict-of-law rules that determine the law applicable to the settlement of an international dispute, as well as the rules on the recognition and enforcement of judgments. However, these provisions are incomplete, they lack uniformity and they are binding only on the signatory states.     Under current Community law, maintenance obligations are governed by Regulation (EC) No       44/2001      on       jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters      . This regulation lays down rules that are favourable towards maintenance creditors as regards determining the court that has jurisdiction and establishes a simplified mechanism for enforcing judgments.     Nevertheless, there remain differences between the legal systems of the European Union (EU) Member States. This is particularly detrimental to maintenance creditors. Cross-border procedures create difficulties for the mutual recognition and enforcement of court judgments.     In order to provide minimum guarantees for European citizens, the Commission has attempted to establish simplified rules of procedure. It is pursuing this objective as part of the project to construct an       area of freedom, justice and security      .     However, not all obstacles to the free movement of judgments have been removed by Community legislation, which means that many practical problems remain that prevent the proper settlement of maintenance claims.     The Commission is therefore presenting this green paper to launch a debate on the legal instruments applicable to maintenance obligations.     The adoption of common standards at Community level would be a step towards greater legal certainty. Thus, the green paper proposes to define the scope of a future Community legal instrument. The principal topics for discussion are:      unification of the rules on conflict of laws with a view to strengthening legal certainty;       automatic recognition of the enforceability of foreign judgments by abolishing the intermediate         exequatur         *        procedures as the basis for effective enforcement of court judgments;       approximation of procedural rules and the establishment of tools to facilitate the enforcement of judgments;       strengthening of judicial cooperation in civil matters, both within the EU and vis-à-vis third countries.       Background      The Amsterdam Treaty provides for the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice within the EU.     Starting from this basis, the Tampere European Council of 15-16 October 1999 adopted a programme of measures for implementing the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in civil and commercial matters. This programme sets the EU objectives for guaranteeing equal access to justice for all European citizens and freedom to exercise their rights.     Community law thus provides for mechanisms that facilitate the settlement of cross-border disputes. However, in the field of maintenance obligations, the fact that there are so many legal sources can hinder the recognition and enforcement of judgments.     Recourse to private international law must be possible in cases where one of the parties is a third-country national.     In order to standardise the texts applicable under private international law, a single convention is being drafted by the Hague Conference on Private International Law, drawing on the most effective aspects of the existing conventions. This should lead to the extension and simplification of the law applicable to maintenance obligations under private international law. The Commission will take account of the outcome of this work in its future proposals.       Key terms used in the act         Maintenance obligations: all maintenance payments in the context of family relationships. Essentially it means maintenance paid to children by their parents (usually following the separation of the holders of parental responsibility) and sums paid by a spouse following divorce as part of the obligation to maintain the duty of assistance.         Exequatur       RELATED ACTS      COMMUNITY LAW       Council Regulation (EC) No         4/2009        of 18 December 2008 on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition and enforcement of decisions and cooperation in matters relating to         maintenance obligations        [Official Journal L 7 of 10.1.2009].      As a follow-up to the green paper, this regulation provides for the effective recovery of cross-border maintenance claims arising from family relationships. It establishes provisions on jurisdiction and applicable law for disputes concerning maintenance obligations. For the recognition, enforceability and enforcement of decisions on maintenance obligations, different provisions are set out for Member States regardless of whether they are bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol on the Law Applicable to Maintenance Obligations. The regulation also provides for the access to justice of the parties involved in disputes, as well as for the designation of central authorities in Member States to assist in the application of this regulation. Finally, it replaces the provisions concerning maintenance obligations of Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial matters.      Council Regulation (EC) No         44/2001        of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters [OJ L 12 of 16.1.2001].      This regulation aims to replace the 1968 Brussels Convention (as amended by other conventions) with a Community instrument without changing its scope. The 1968 Convention covers all areas of civil and commercial law, except those expressly excluded from its application: the status or legal capacity of natural persons, rights in property arising out of a matrimonial relationship, wills and succession, bankruptcy, social security and arbitration. The regulation lays down provisions concerning general , special and some exclusive jurisdiction, as well as jurisdiction in matters relating to insurance, consumer contracts and individual contracts of employment. It also contains rules on prorogation, examination, admissibility,       lis pendens      and related actions, as well as provisional and protective measures. Furthermore, it contains provisions on questions related to the recognition and enforcement of judgments, authentic instruments and court settlements, general, transitional and final provisions, and relations with other instruments.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 847/2004 — negotiation and implementation of air service agreements between EU countries and non-EU countries   what is the aim of this regulation   It establishes a procedure for notifying and authorising negotiations conducted by European Union (EU) countries with non-EU countries on bilateral air service agreements (ASAs).   It aims to ensure that existing agreements comply with EU law.   key points    EU competence    In November 2002, the  Court of Justice of the European Union  confirmed  the EU’s exclusive right  to negotiate, sign and conclude international ASAs with non-EU countries when they deal with matters within the EU’s  exclusive competence  .   At the time of the Court’s ruling, a large number of ASAs existed which did not comply with EU law. Since then, a large number of these have been brought into conformity with EU law.    Objective   Those ASAs not complying with EU law need to be amended in order to:   ensure  legal certainty  in such agreements for both parties;   guarantee all EU airlines the  right of establishment  within the EU, including  non-discriminatory  market access to routes between all EU countries and non-EU countries where ASAs existed.    Amending an ASA   There are 2 ways to amend an ASA:    Horizontal agreements  — acting on behalf of the EU countries concerned which have bilateral ASAs with a non-EU country, the  European Commission  negotiates a single agreement with that non-EU country.    Bilateral negotiations  — amending or replacing each ASA individually.    Rules and procedure for bilateral negotiations    An EU country can enter into bilateral negotiations to amend or replace an ASA which falls partly within the competence of the EU if it follows the rules and procedure set out in the regulation:   any  relevant standard clauses  , developed jointly between EU countries and the Commission, are included in such negotiations and the notification procedure is complied with;   it  notifies  the Commission of its intentions  in writing  .     If, within  15 working days  of receiving the notification, the Commission concludes that such negotiations are likely to  undermine the objectives of EU negotiations  already taking place with the non-EU country and/or lead to an agreement which is  incompatible with EU law  , it must inform the EU country accordingly.   An EU country may not enter into any new arrangement with a non-EU country that  reduces the number of EU air carriers  allowed to provide services between its territory and that country.   from when does the regulation apply  It entered into force on 30 May 2004.   background    External Aviation Policy — Horizontal Agreements  .
   Common organisation of sheepmeat and goatmeat markets     Common organisation of sheepmeat and goatmeat markets     The common organisation of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat is designed to stabilise prices and guarantee a fair level of income for farmers, while establishing a system of prices and arrangements for trade with third countries. These specific provisions remain in force until 30 June 2008.     ACT     Council Regulation (EC) No       2529/2001      of 19 December 2001 on the common organisation of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat [       see amending Acts      ].     SUMMARY     As from 1 July 2008, products falling under the scope of this Regulation will be covered by the       common organisation of agricultural markets      .      Scope      The products affected are lambs, live sheep and goats, fresh, chilled and frozen meat from sheep or goats, edible offal, fats and other prepared or preserved meat and offal from sheep or goats.      Private storage aid      When there is a particularly difficult market situation in Great Britain, Northern Ireland or any other Member State taken separately, the European Commission may decide to grant private storage aid within the framework of a tendering procedure. In urgent cases, aid amounts may be fixed in advance without tendering.      Trade with third countries      Imports and exports may be subject to presentation of an       import or export licence      issued by Member States to any applicant.     The rates of duty in the       Common Customs Tariff      apply to products in the sheepmeat and goatmeat sectors.      Additional import duties      may be imposed if there is a risk that imports might destabilise the Community market.      Tariff quotas      are administered by applying one of the following methods: first come, first served; simultaneous examination; or traditional/new arrival. Other non-discriminatory methods may be applied.     The use of       inward processing arrangements      may be prohibited to the extent necessary for the proper working of the common organisation of the market or if there is a risk of the Community market being disturbed.     When trading with third countries, it is forbidden to impose charges having equivalent effect to customs duties or to apply any quantitative import restrictions or measures having the same effect.      Protective measures      may be taken if the Community market is threatened with disturbance by reason of imports or exports.      Other provisions      Member States monitor prices on the market. When there is a substantial rise or fall in prices and this threatens to disturb the market, the necessary measures may be taken.     Exceptional measures may be taken to support a market affected by restrictions on free movement resulting from       animal diseases      .     Save as otherwise provided in this Regulation, the Treaty rules on       State aid      apply to the sheepmeat and goatmeat sector.     The Member States and the Commission notify one another of the information needed in order to implement the Regulation.     In implementing the Regulation, the Commission is assisted by a       Management Committee for Sheepmeat and Goatmeat      , comprising representatives of the Member States and chaired by a representative of the Commission.     At the end of 2005, the Commission reported to the European Parliament and the Council on the environmental consequences of sheep and goat farming.     If necessary,       transitional measures      may be taken to ensure the smooth changeover to the new common organisation of the market.      Background      This common organisation of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat brought together all the various pieces of legislation governing that market up until 2001. It regulated trade in these products both on the internal market and with third countries. It did so by providing aid to Community producers in the form of direct payments.     This scheme was replaced by the 2003 agricultural reform which introduced the       single farm payment      , while still providing ewe and goat premiums.     In 2007, the common organisation of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat was subsumed under the       single common organisation of the market      , which replaced the 21 individual systems in place for various sectors and simplified the legislative framework for the common agriculture policy.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 662/2009 — negotiation and conclusion of agreements between EU and non-EU countries in regard to the law applicable to contractual and non-contractual obligations   what is the aim of this regulation   It aims at ensuring coherence in the EU’s external action in an area now falling within the  exclusive competence  of the EU.   It establishes a procedure of authorisation for an EU country to amend an existing agreement or –– to negotiate and conclude a new agreement with a non-EU country related to specific matters of applicable law in contractual and non-contractual obligations  *  . The procedure is subject to strict rules and has to be considered exceptional.   key points    Scope  : the regulation applies to agreements concerning particular matters falling, entirely or partly, within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (  Rome I  ) and Regulation (EC) No 864/2007 on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (  Rome II  ).   Notification  : where an EU country intends to enter into negotiations in order to amend an existing agreement or to conclude a new agreement falling within the scope of the regulation, it must notify the  European Commission  in writing of its intention as soon as possible before the envisaged opening of formal negotiations.   Confidentiality  : the Commission has to treat the information communicated by the EU country as confidential, if so requested.   Assessment  : the Commission must:   firstly, check that no relevant negotiating mandate for concluding an EU-level agreement with the non-EU country concerned is envisaged within the next 24 months;   if not, verify that there is a genuine specific interest of the EU country for the agreement and that the envisaged agreement would not undermine the effectiveness of EU law and the object and purpose of the EU external relations policy; and   if necessary, request further information.    Authorisation of negotiations  : if the conditions are met, the Commission authorises the EU country to open formal negotiations on the agreement. The Commission may propose negotiating guidelines as well as the inclusion of particular clauses in the envisaged agreement.   Participation  : the Commission may participate as an observer in the negotiations, and otherwise should be kept informed of progress and results.   Clauses in the agreement  : where is is authorised, the agreement will in any case have to stipulate   that the agreement is fully or partially terminated in the event of a subsequent agreement between the EU and the same non-EU country on the same subject matter; and   that a subsequent agreement between the EU and the non-EU country on the same subject matter direct replace the relevant clauses of the agreement.    Authorisation of conclusion  : before signing the agreement, the EU country must notify the outcome of the negotiations and submit the text of the agreement to the Commission, for authorisation of conclusion after verifying that the conditions are met.   Refusal  : the regulation sets out the procedure for and consequences of the Commission’s refusal to authorise negotiations or the conclusion of the agreement.   Review and expiry   The regulation expires 3 years after the submission by the Commission — no earlier than 7 July 2017 — of a report on its application. In that report, the Commission must indicate whether it recommends that this regulation be replaced at its expiry by a new regulation.  Any negotiation underway at the date of expiry may continue.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 20 August 2009.   background   This regulation should be seen in the context of the EU’s exclusive external competence for these areas of civil law. Before the adoption of the relevant internal EU Regulations (Rome I and Rome II), the EU countries themselves concluded agreements with non-EU countries in this area.  As part of the EU approach to judicial cooperation and agreements with non-EU countries in civil matters, this regulation comes along with Regulation (EC) No  664/2009  concerning jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments and decisions in matrimonial matters, parental responsibility and maintenance obligations which entered into force the same day and is based on a similar procedure.  For more information, see:    Civil and commercial matters  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Non-contractual obligation:  where a person who is responsible for loss sustained by another person outside the performance of a contract – e.g. due to a tort or by unjust enrichment – is required to compensate the loss.
summary of   Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora   what is the aim of the directive   It seeks to contribute to ensuring biodiversity in the European Union by the conservation of:   natural habitats, and   wild fauna and flora species.     It sets up the  ‘Natura 2000’  network, the largest ecological network in the world. Natura 2000 comprises  special areas of conservation  designated by EU countries under this directive. Natura 2000 also includes the  special protection areas  classified under the  Birds Directive (Directive 2009/147/EC)  .   key points    Protection of sites (Natura 2000 network)    The directive’s Annexes I and II list the  types of habitats and species of special areas of conservation  whose conservation requires the   designation  of special areas of conservation   *  . Some of these are defined as  ‘priority’  habitats or species in danger of disappearing and for which there are specific rules.   Annex III lists the  criteria  for selecting sites eligible for identification as sites of Community importance and for designation as  special areas of conservation  .   The  designation process  is in 3 stages:    1.    Using the criteria in the annexes, each EU country draws up a  list  of sites hosting natural habitats and wild fauna and flora.      2.   On the basis of the national lists and in agreement with the EU countries, the  European Commission  then adopts a  list of sites of Community importance  for each of the EU’s  9 biogeographical regions  :   the  Alpine  region;   the  Atlantic  region;   the  Black Sea  region;   the  Boreal  region;   the  Continental  region;   the  Macaronesian  region;   the  Mediterranean  region;   the  Pannonian  region;   the  Steppic  region.       3.    Within 6 years of the selection of a site of Community importance, the EU country concerned must designate it as a  special area of conservation  .         Consultation procedure     Where the Commission considers that a site which hosts a priority natural habitat type or species has been  omitted  from a national list, a  consultation procedure  may take place between itself and the country in question. If the result is unsatisfactory, the Commission may forward a proposal to the  Council  on the selection of the site as one of Community importance.     Conservation objectives and measures     Once special areas for conservation are designated, EU countries must introduce appropriate conservation objectives and measures. They must do everything possible to:   guarantee the conservation of habitats in these areas;   avoid their deterioration and any significant disturbance to species.     EU countries must also:   encourage the proper management of  landscape features  essential for the migration, dispersal and genetic exchange of wild species;   undertake  surveillance  of both habitats and species.       Assessment of plans/projects     Any plan or project that is likely to have a significant impact on a Natura 2000 site should be a subject of  appropriate assessment.  EU countries must agree on a plan or project only after having ascertained that it will not have a significant impact on the integrity of protected sites.   In the absence of other alternatives, some projects that will cause significant negative impact may still be permitted for imperative reasons of  overriding public interest  (i.e. social or economic reasons). Where this arises, EU countries must introduce  compensatory measures  to ensure the overall coherence of the Natura 2000 network.    Protection of species   EU countries must:   establish  systems of strict protection  for animal and plant species which are particularly threatened (Annex IV), prohibiting   all forms of deliberate capture or killing of specimens of these species in the wild;   deliberate disturbance of these species, particularly during the period of breeding, rearing, hibernation and migration;   deliberate destruction or taking of eggs from the wild;   deterioration or destruction of breeding sites or resting places;      prohibit the use of non-selective methods  of taking, capturing or killing certain animal and plant species (Annex V);   set up a system to monitor the  incidental capture and killing  of the animal species listed in Annex IV(a);    report the measures  they have taken to the Commission every 6 years. The Commission then issues a composite  report  covering the entire EU.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 10 June 1992. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 10 June 1994.   background   The Natura 2000 network represents almost one fifth of the EU’s land area and more than 250 000 km  2  of marine area.  See also:    ‘The Habitats Directive’  on the European Commission’s website.    ‘The Birds Directive’  on the European Commission’s website.    ‘Natura 2000’  on the European Commission’s website.    ‘European Topic Centre on Biological Diversity’  on the Eionet’s website.   * key terms     Special area of conservation:  a site of Community (i.e. EU) importance designated by EU countries where the required conservation measures are taken to ensure that the favourable conservation status of the natural habitats and/or the populations of the species for which the site is designated is maintained or restored.
summary of   European Commission communication (COM(2011) 567 final) — an agenda for modernising the EU’s higher education systems   summary    what does this communication do  It sets out the key priorities for higher education in the EU. The agenda is designed to enable higher education systems to contribute better to the goals of the  Europe 2020  strategy for growth.  The communication has been followed by 2  report  s to the  European Commission  in  2013  and 2014 on improving the quality of teaching and learning in Europe’s higher education institutions, and on new ways of teaching and learning in higher education.   key points   The communication sets out 5 key priority areas for action by EU countries and higher education institutions, as well as the measures the EU will take to support their efforts.    1.     Increasing attainment levels  — one of the targets of the Europe 2020 strategy is that, by 2020, 40 % of young people should have completed higher education studies. It is also estimated that one million job openings will require high-level research skills.      To achieve this, the communication recommends:   reducing  early school leaving  and attracting more people into higher education, particularly through outreach and financial support for school students from disadvantaged groups and adults;   improving the conditions for industry to invest in  research and innovation  , and equipping the existing workforce with better research skills;   developing clear ways of progressing from vocational and other types of education into higher education, and outside academia for researchers.     A 2015 study set out the completion and dropout rates for higher education across Europe.    2.     Improving the quality and relevance of higher education       The communication recommends:   curricula, including researcher training, to respond to current and future labour market needs through skills and growth projections as well as through involving employers and labour market institutions in their design and delivery;   new technologies to be exploited for more effective research methods and more flexible and personalised teaching (e.g. eLearning);   better working conditions, including continuing professional development and introduction of incentives to reward excellence for institutions to attract and retain high quality teaching and research staff.       3.     Promoting mobility and cross-border cooperation  — a target has been set by European higher education ministers to increase the number of students completing a period of study or training abroad up to 20 % by 2020.      To achieve this, the communication recommends:   systematically building mobility into curricula;   improving the recognition of diplomas and credits or portability of grants through comparable and consistent use of  ECTS  and the  Diploma Supplement  , and linking qualifications to the  European Qualifications Framework  ;   enhancing access, employment conditions and opportunities to progress for students, researchers and teachers from other countries.       4.     Strengthening the ‘knowledge triangle’ linking education, research and innovation       The communication recommends:   public policies to encourage partnerships between higher education institutions and businesses through:   reward structures and incentives for regional development,   multidisciplinarity,   cross-organisational cooperation and   the reduction of regulatory and administrative barriers to intersectoral partnerships;     higher education institutions to use the results of research and innovation in their educational offer to stimulate the development of entrepreneurial, creative and innovative skills.       5.     Improving governance and funding       The communication recommends:   increasing cost-effectiveness of public investment in higher education by linking funding to performance with an element of competition;   increasing investment in higher education by diversifying funding sources, and facilitating access to alternative resources, including private funding;   investing in professional management;   making funding and governance systems more flexible to increase higher education institutions’ autonomy and allow them to develop their own strategic direction.      EU contribution   The EU intends to support the efforts undertaken by national authorities and institutions in these 5 domains by:   monitoring the Europe 2020 strategy and   making sure that its  financial framework for 2014-2020  enables the different policies concerned to support the modernisation of higher education.   Actions to be taken by the Commission include:   enabling students to make informed choices by means of a ranking tool (  U-Multirank  ) for universities based on performance in 5 areas;   improving the recognition of studies abroad by strengthening the  European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System  (ECTS);   introducing a loan guarantee facility (  Master Loan Erasmus+  ) for students taking a master’s degree in another EU country;   adopting a  Strategic Innovation Agenda  ;   proposing a quality framework for traineeships with a single platform for traineeship offers in Europe;   developing relations with higher education in non-EU countries (see 2013  communication  on European higher education in the world);   amending the directives on  students  and  researchers  to make the EU even more attractive to the latter.   background   For more information, see    ‘EU activities in the field of higher education’  on the European Commission's website.   act   Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Supporting growth and jobs — an agenda for the modernisation of Europe’s higher education systems (  COM(2011) 567 final  of 20.9.2011)
summary of   Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 — requirements for gaseous and particulate pollutant emission limits for internal combustion engines   what is the aim of the regulation  It defines pollutant emission limits for engines of different power ranges and applications for non-road mobile machinery (see below) with the aim of gradually reducing emissions and phasing out equipment with the most polluting engines.   key points    Non- road mobile machinery  (NRMM) covers a very wide variety of machinery typically used off the road such as:    small gardening and handheld equipment  (lawn mowers, chainsaws, etc.);    construction machinery  (excavators, loaders, bulldozers, etc.);    agricultural & farming machinery  (harvesters, cultivators, etc.);    railcars, locomotives and inland waterway vessels  .   The regulation does not apply to engines for a number of specific applications, including those for:   stationary machinery,   sea-going vessels that must have a valid maritime navigation or safety certificate,   recreational vehicles, except snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles and side-by-side vehicles,   vehicles and machinery exclusively used or intended to be exclusively used in competitions.    Type-approval    The regulation sets out the  procedures  engine manufacturers have to follow in order to obtain type-approval  *  of their engines.   Type-approval is a  requirement  for manufacturers to place their engines on the European Union (EU) market.   Manufacturers must submit a  separate application  for each engine type or engine family  *  to the approval authority of an EU country.   Type-approvals are issued for an  unlimited duration  .   The EU may decide that international regulations or non-EU country regulations are  equivalent  to the conditions and procedures for EU type-approval.   National authorities are required to cooperate efficiently with each other and with the  European Commission  , and to exchange data and information relating to EU type-approvals through the  Internal Market Information System  (IMI).    Exhaust emissions    The design, construction and assembly of engine types and engine families must comply with the requirements set out in the regulation.   Engine types and engine families must not exceed the exhaust emission limit values from the dates set out in the regulation for placing those engines on market.   from when does the regulation apply  It applies from 1 January 2017.   background   For more information, see:    ‘Non-Road mobile machinery emissions’  on the European Commission's website.   * key terms     Type-approval:  the procedure whereby an approval authority certifies that a type of vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit satisfies certain legal requirements.     Engine family:  manufacturer’s grouping of engine types which, through their design, have similar exhaust emission characteristics, and respect the applicable emission limit values.
summary of   Commission Communication COM(2001) 153 final: the approach of Linking Relief, Rehabilitation and Development   summary    what does this communication do  Emergency relief operations deal with immediate needs, but should also find ways to boost resilience to future crises by providing longer-term development benefits and strengthening risk management. This approach is called Linking Relief, Rehabilitation and Development (LRRD).  In discussing the challenges to be addressed by the international community in post-crisis situations, the Communication identifies measures to improve the EU's contribution, and aims to link immediate assistance effectively with longer term development policies.   key points   The Communication refers to 3 categories of crisis.    Natural disasters  , such as famine, floods and earthquakes. Immediate aid is necessary, but disaster preparedness, such as early warning systems for famines and planting to prevent flooding, represent a more difficult challenge.    Violent conflicts  . These can be especially challenging because of conflicting interests between the parties, or long-term instabilities. The EU needs to work in a broad context, since aid risks bringing negative consequences such as corruption, or prolongation of the conflict.    Structural and other types of crises.  This includes countries suffering from declining political, economic or social conditions, such as Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus, where relief could have a distorting effect by creating dependency or fuelling tensions. Development aid can help by improving institutional structures and removing barriers to production and trade.   To respond more effectively to post-crisis situations, the following approach is proposed:   The  European Commission  is to adopt an early co-ordination and collaboration role, reinforcing the link between humanitarian assistance and development.   In countries prone to natural disasters, increased attention should be paid to disaster preparedness and prevention both in humanitarian assistance and development cooperation strategies.   Post crisis or disaster recovery and rehabilitation strategies should attempt to address the causes of vulnerability, and incorporate disaster risk reduction and preparedness - sometimes referred to as ‘build back better’.   In conflict situations, the link between relief and development must be seen in a broader economic, social and political context.   Emergency assistance must be consistent with long term development objectives.   Account must be taken of long term partnerships such as the  Cotonou Agreement  between developing countries and the EU.   International initiatives must be better co-ordinated, including by strengthening the ‘Friends of’* approach.   The Commission should reduce delays and mobilise adequate resources quickly, ensuring the involvement of appropriate partners, a leaner decision-making process within the EU, and accepting a higher degree of technical risk.   Work programmes should be drawn up in response to crisis situations, covering the actions and measures required, and eliminating the need for individual project approval.   Tendering procedures and contracts should be more flexible in relation to rehabilitation, aid to refugees, food aid and food security, and landmines.   New regulations could be better organised to cover rehabilitation, aid to refugees and landmine issues.   There should be wide-ranging discussion on the ideas put forward with a view to further enhancing the EU's ability to positively influence outcomes.   Some of the discussion in this communication is resumed and further developed in the Commission's 2012 communication on the  EU Approach to Resilience: Learning from food security crises  .   background    Resilience and Linking Relief, Rehabilitation and Development   key term    * The ‘Friends of’ approach  : a United Nations strategy aimed at involving the largest possible number of international donors co-ordinating their actions in a particular country.   act   Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament – Linking Relief, Rehabilitation and Development – An assessment (  COM(2001) 153 final  of 23.4.2001)
   Seventh Framework Programme (2007 to 2013)     Seventh Framework Programme (2007 to 2013)     Research is a component of a knowledge triangle (the other two being education and innovation) meant to boost growth and employment in the European Union (EU) in the context of a global economy. The 7th Framework Programme for Research, covering the period 2007 to 2013, is an opportunity for the EU to match its research policy to its ambitions in terms of economic and social policy by consolidating the European Research Area (ERA). In order to achieve this objective, the Commission hopes to increase the EU's annual spending on research, thereby generating more national and private investment in this field. When it is implemented, the 7th Framework Programme will also have to respond to the research and knowledge needs of industry and more generally of EU policies. The Framework Programme is organised around four main programmes and has been greatly simplified so as to be more effective and more accessible to researchers.     ACTS     Decision No       1982/2006/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (2007-13).     Council Decision       969/2006/EC      of 18 December 2006 concerning the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) or nuclear research and training activities (2007-11).     SUMMARY     The 7th Framework Programme is adapted to the EU’s needs in terms of growth and employment. After wide-ranging public consultation, four main objectives have been identified, which correspond to the four specific programmes around which the European research effort is to be structured.      Four main specific programmes      The       Cooperation      Programme aims to stimulate cooperation and improve links between industry and research within a transnational framework. The aim is for Europe to gain and consolidate leadership in key research areas. The programme will have nine themes, which are to be managed autonomously but will be complementary in terms of implementation:      health;       food, agriculture and biotechnology;       information and communication technologies;       nanosciences, nanotechnologies, materials and new production technologies;       energy;       environment (including climate change);       transport (including aeronautics);       socio-economic sciences and the humanities;       security and space.      The       Ideas      Programme is intended to enhance exploratory research in Europe, i.e. aimed at discovering new knowledge that fundamentally changes our vision of the world and our way of life. In order to achieve this, the new European Research Council will support the most ambitious and innovative research projects. Within this new structure, at the forefront of European research, there will be an autonomous Scientific Council, which will identify priorities and scientific strategies. The aim is to enhance European research excellence by promoting competition and risk-taking.     The       People      Programme will harness significant financial resources that can be used to improve the career prospects of researchers in Europe and attract more high-quality young researchers. The Commission hopes to encourage training and mobility so that European researchers can realise their full potential. The programme will reinforce the existing "Marie Curie" actions, which for several years have been offering mobility and training opportunities to European researchers.     The       Capacities      Programme is intended to give researchers powerful tools that will enable them to enhance the quality and competitiveness of European research. This means more investment in research infrastructure in the less successful regions, in the creation of regional research-driven clusters and in research for the benefit of SMEs. This programme also has to reflect the importance of international cooperation in research and the role of science in society.     Furthermore, the 7th Framework Programme will finance the direct actions of the       Joint Research Centre (JRC)      and the actions covered by the       Euratom Framework Programme      in the fields of:      research into fusion energy;       nuclear fission and radiation protection.       Change in the duration of the programme      The 7th Framework Programme takes over many features from previous programmes that have had a positive effect on European research. This is the case with the projects run by European partner groups, which will continue to have a central role in the Framework Programme. Similarly, the Commission places the Framework Programme within the context of the European Research Area, which brings together all of the EU's activities in this field. The extension of the programme from four to seven years is indicative of the EU’s sustained commitment to stimulating European research.     While preserving the best aspects of the previous programmes, the 7th Framework Programme introduces new measures designed to improve the coherence and effectiveness of the EU’s research policy. The main innovations introduced in this framework programme are:      simplification of the procedures for participation in the programme;       implementation of the programme and its budget by theme instead of by instrument, so that it may function more coherently and effectively;       creation of the European Research Council under the Ideas Programme to support exploratory research;       improved cooperation with industry via the Joint Technology Initiatives, which will combine private investment and public funding;       the support of a European research infrastructures policy;       creation of a Risk Sharing Finance Facility to make it easier for participants to access European Investment Bank loans.      As was the case during the       Sixth Framework Programme      , several research areas will       not      receive Community financing:      reproductive human cloning       research aiming to alter human genetic stock such that modifications become heritable;       research aiming to create human embryos solely for research purposes or for stem cell procurement.       A simplified Framework Programme      Since 1984, various framework programmes have increased the number of administrative and financial procedures which govern the EU's research effort. The Commission hopes to continue the process of simplification launched under the previous framework programme, thereby making the financing and management of research projects more effective.     Specific measures designed to simplify the framework programme’s implementation include:      streamlining of funding schemes and a more limited choice of instruments for more coherent funding;       use of simpler and less bureaucratic language in order to be more comprehensible to the general public;       reduction in the number and size of official documents;       simplification of the procedures participants have to go through;       reduction in the number of preliminary checks prior to the adoption of a project;       greater autonomy for partner groups;       simplification of the selection procedure for projects.       A budget that is large but necessary      The Commission is proposing a budget of EUR 50 521 million for the period of 2007-13, i.e. an average of EUR 7 217 per annum. This total is in fact one and a half times that of the annual budget of the 6th Framework Programme, set at EUR 4 375 per annum, i.e. a total of EUR 17 500 million over four years). The budget will be broken down as follows:      Cooperation: EUR 32 413 million.       Ideas: EUR 7 513 million.       People: EUR 4 750 million.       Capacities: EUR 4 097 million.       Non-nuclear actions taken by the JRC: EUR 1 751 million.       Euratom: EUR 2 700 million (2007-11).      This increase reflects the importance of research in the       relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy      , which aims to make Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge economy in the world. Recently, Europe has missed big opportunities in certain key areas due to a lack of available funds. This Framework Programme will make it possible to finance more quality projects and enhance the EU’s innovation capacity.     Knowledge and technology are Europe’s main advantages and represent the foundation for growth and employment. The Framework Programme is intended to have a leverage effect on national research spending, in order to achieve the objective of spending 3 % of GDP on research in Europe. The Commission intends to play a central role in driving and coordinating European research, so that knowledge is placed at the service of growth and employment in Europe.      Background      Since 1984, the EU has run its research and technological development policy on the basis of multiannual framework programmes. The 7th Framework Programme is the second since the launching of the       Lisbon Strategy      in 2000 and should play a fundamental role in growth and employment in Europe in years to come. The Commission wants to develop the knowledge triangle formed by research, education and innovation policies, in order to place knowledge at the service of a dynamic economy and social and environmental progress.

The 7th Framework Programme is adapting to help the EU meet its goals of creating a low carbon, knowledge-based society. It seeks to increase public and private R&D investment and to diversify its instruments in order to maximise European added value.     FP7 is crucial in promoting scientific excellence and technological. Its role is even more important now given the current economic situation. FP7 contributes to sustained research efforts, both private and public, as exemplified in the public private partnership initiatives for green cars, energy efficient buildings and factories of the future launched as part of the European Recovery Plan.     The Commission has requested a group of experts to carry out an interim evaluation of FP7 in order to improve its impact on shaping the European Research Area. The conclusions from this evaluation will feed into the debates on the future financial frameworks of the European Union, the post-2010 Lisbon Strategy and the next Framework Programme.

   Green Paper: European Contract Law for consumers and businesses     Green Paper: European Contract Law for consumers and businesses     This Green Paper launches a consultation of stakeholders in order to identify solutions which could improve contract law in the European Union (EU). Different national rules effectively hinder the smooth functioning of the European internal market. The proposed options should help to resolve the existing problems.     ACT     Green Paper from the Commission of 1 July 2010 on policy options for progress towards a European Contract Law for consumers and businesses [       COM(2010) 348      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     In this Green Paper, the Commission sets out solutions aimed at improving the coherence of       European Contract Law      . Some of the options presented concern rules which are mandatory, others concern solutions which are more flexible and may be implemented voluntarily by Member States. Following an assessment of the results of the consultation being launched by this Green Paper, the Commission is to propose new European legislation before the end of 2011.     New European legislation could facilitate and increase business activity and consumer confidence when concluding       contracts of sale      in another European country. A new European legal instrument also provides a way to increase legal certainty and to reduce the high transaction costs involved in this type of trade. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are particularly affected by these issues.     A new legal instrument would enable European businesses to make savings, increase their product offer and provide better value for money to the benefit of European consumers.      A new European instrument      The Commission makes a set of proposals on the       legal nature      of the instrument. It could take the form of:      a         publication        by an Expert Group, whose recommendations could be used in the development of laws and model contracts;       a         toolbox        for legislators, in the form of a Commission act or an interinstitutional agreement (between the Commission, Council and Parliament), to be used as a reference on matters of contract law;       a         Commission Recommendation        , for European Union (EU) countries to gradually and voluntarily adopt a European instrument. This solution would give them the option to either amend their national law or to create an optional regime;       a         Directive on harmonising national laws        , drawn up on the basis of minimum common standards. States could therefore retain more protective rules than those in the Directive;       a         Regulation setting up an optional instrument        , specifically an alternative legal regime could be adopted by every country, providing contracting parties with the option to freely choose between the two regimes;       a         Regulation establishing European Contract Law        , replacing national legislations;       a         Regulation establishing a European Civil Code        , which would replace not only national contract laws, but also the rules applicable to other related fields (such as tort law and benevolent intervention).      These new standards could relate to:       contracts between businesses and consumers        . In this area, the applicable law is to be partially harmonised (“minimum harmonisation”), specifically to ensure consumer protection. In the event of dispute between parties from two different countries, businesses shall apply the law of the country of residence of the consumer, or at least the mandatory provisions;        business-to-business contracts        . In this area, the parties are free to choose the law applicable to the contract.      In addition, the       scope      of the new instrument could cover all domestic and cross-border contracts or cross-border contracts only.     Finally, the       content of the instrument      could provide:       certain rules for general contract law        , particularly those relating to the formation and performance of contracts, to the right of withdrawal, to change of parties, etc.;        general rules and rules specific to certain types of contracts        , for example concerning the most prevalent types of contracts (sale of goods and certain provision of services).

act   Council Regulation (EC) No  1/2003  of 16 December 2002 on the implementation of the rules on competition laid down in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty.   summary   In the interest of both consumers and businesses, the European Union (EU) has rules to outlaw  cartels  that fix prices or carve up markets between competitors. The EU also seeks to prevent firms from abusing their dominant position in a market, for example by charging unfair prices or limiting production.   what does the regulation do  It implements the EU competition rules laid down by Article  101  (concerted practices that restrict competition) and Article  102  (abuse of dominant position) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) (formerly Articles 81 and 82 of the treaty establishing the European Community (EC Treaty). It introduced rules that changed, above all, the enforcement aspects of EU  competition  policy.  It allows for competition rules previously applied by the European Commission to be enforced on a decentralised basis by EU countries’ competition authorities. It thus enhanced the role of national  antitrust  authorities and courts in implementing EU competition law. This allows the Commission to focus its resources on enforcing the most serious competition infringements with a cross-border dimension.   key points    Article 101 (TFEU) procedures - antitrust   Cases to investigate anti-competitive agreements (e.g. cartels) are triggered by:        —     a complaint (e.g. from a competitor);            —     the initiative of the competition authority (national authority or European Commission);            —     an application under a  leniency programme  (where a participant in a cartel may avoid a fine or have it reduced if it provides information on the cartel).      Where the European Commission launches an investigation, it has  wide-ranging powers  . These include the right to request information from companies but also to enter companies’ premises, seize their records and interrogate their representatives.  If, on the basis of its initial investigations, the Commission decides to pursue an in-depth investigation, it sets out a  statement of objections  (SO) which it sends to the companies in question.  Companies under investigation may access the Commission’s file and respond to the SO. They may also request a  hearing  . If, after this stage, the Commission is still convinced there is an infringement, it may issue an  infringement decision  which may include the imposition of  fines  on the parties.  The Commission may instead decide to adopt a  commitment decision  where no fines are imposed. Here, the parties make an undertaking to address the Commission’s competition concerns, normally for a given period. If they breach this commitment, they may be fined.  Parties may appeal Commission decisions at the  General Court  .  Under  Directive 2014/104/EU  , victims of cartels or antitrust violations may be compensated for damages.   Article 102 (TFEU) procedures - abuse of dominance   A national competition authority or the Commission may open an investigation on its own initiative or following a complaint.  The key first step in such cases is to assess whether the firm involved is ‘  dominant  ’. This involves defining its market both in terms of the product(s) it supplies and the geographic area in which they are sold. As a general rule, if the market share is under 40 %, it is unlikely to be dominant.   Other factors  are also taken into account such as whether there are barriers preventing new entrants to the market or the degree to which the firm under investigation is involved at different levels of the supply chain (known as ‘vertical integration’).  The next step is to find out whether this dominant position is being  abused  due to practices such as predatory pricing (prices that undercut competitors), insisting that the firm is the exclusive supplier, etc.  The competition authorities have the same investigation powers as for Article 101 procedures. Aspects such as rights of defence, the system of SOs, commitment decisions, fines and compensation are also identical.  Lastly, a European competition network consisting of the national competition authorities and the Commission allows them to exchange information, including confidential information, to help them enforce violations of the competition rules.   from when does the regulation apply  From 24 January 2003.

   Challenges for the European Information Society beyond 2005     Challenges for the European Information Society beyond 2005     Information and communications technologies (ICT)       *      allow for faster technical progress, modernisation and structural changes to be made to the economy. Given that ICT greatly improve competitiveness, the European Union (EU) should make use of all the possibilities offered by them to contribute to achieving the Lisbon goals       *      . ICT are central to this process. Through this communication, the Commission aims to launch a broad political debate on the EU Information Society strategy beyond 2005.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, 19 November 2004: "Challenges for European Information Society beyond 2005" [       COM(2004) 757      final - Not yet published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This communication recommends more widespread use of ICT. Their wide dissemination will depend on the ability of the EU to find solutions to the many problems raised by their use and to make their advantages more obvious. It must be ensured that as many people as possible benefit from their use. The       eEurope      initiative launched by the European Commission in June 2000 has proved very positive.      The contribution of ICT to the Lisbon Goals      The EU is still far from exploiting all the possibilities offered by ICT for achieving the Lisbon objectives. Greater use of these new technologies would have a positive impact on European productivity and competitiveness, as well as on society as a whole. This sector is one of the most innovative and productive, representing about 8% of the EU's GDP and accounting for 6% of jobs in 2000. 40% of productivity growth between 1995 and 2000 was due to ICT. ICT also boost citizenship and improve the quality of life by allowing more and better services to be provided to larger numbers of people.      Information Society policies      Given the huge potential for growth in this sector, it is necessary to implement ICT-specific policies and adapt current policies to new developments. The different Information Society initiatives in the EU should be linked together by abolishing sectoral boundaries and ensuring an even take-up of ICT in society.     At the global level, the market is rapidly expanding, especially in China, India and Brazil. The EU must follow the developments in these countries closely. Close international co-operation is needed to deal with threats to       network safety      and to prevent cyber crime.     Even if the EU and the Member States already support the research efforts of European companies, research and development (R&D) needs in this field are still very great. Similarly, there is an increasing need for research on the socio-economic impact of applying ICT in the various sectors.      Issues for an Information Society policy beyond 2005      The changes which have had to be made for ICT to be used are not just about technology. New social and economic structures and new forms of governance are appearing, leading to new ways of communication and interaction between individuals, businesses and the public authorities. The Commission has identified a number of issues that it considers important, in particular:       Content and services        : the EU must support content providers and foster the emergence of innovative services. The variety of obstacles slowing down the development of new services and content must be eradicated so that users and businesses can benefit from them;        eInclusion and citizenship        : citizenship is about the participation of all in society. The policies of "eInclusion"         *        aim at ensuring equal access to and the availability of ICT services for all at an affordable cost. New and complex technologies marginalise those who are not equipped to use them. In order to avoid the creation of new divides, it is important to ensure digital literacy for everyone and that technologies are easy to use;        Public services        : the use of ICT in         this area        will increase democracy and transparency. Their use also ensures that services are more efficient and of a better quality;        Skills and work        : the ICT component must be strengthened during all         learning and training processes        to obtain the full benefit for users in this field. Europe must apply ICT in the workplace in ways that raise efficiency and provide better jobs;        ICT as a key industrial sector        : by covering information technology, electronic communications and audio-visual markets, ICT represent a major sector of the economy. In order to make Europe a more attractive place for foreign investors, it is important to create a competitive environment that is as clear and simple as possible;        Interoperability         *        : Interoperability should be guaranteed at all levels - for network operators, for content or service providers and consumers - as well as between services, legal provisions and administrative practises which are different in every country;        Trust and dependability        : it is essential that these resources are both safe and reliable. Consumers want their privacy to be guaranteed and to see action taken to prevent illegal commercial practises and all unsolicited communications. The infrastructures of modern life rely heavily on ICT and are interdependent, so failures may have far-reaching consequences;        Exploitation of ICT by business        : given that the use of ICT by companies is recognised as being one of the success factors for European competitiveness, these companies should use them efficiently, especially SMEs.      The EU will face a number of challenges in the field of ICT in the next few years. This area, which is already important, is crucial for growth and improving productivity as well as for strengthening citizenship and quality of life. The effective adoption of new business processes and economic models to exploit the potential of ICT remains a challenge. The Commission considers it necessary to intensify research and investments in these production-generating technologies. Through this communication, the Commission is launching a process of reflection on this subject and broad consultation among stakeholders.       Key terms used in the act         Information and communications technologies (ICT): the term ICT covers a large range of services, applications, technologies, equipment and software, i.e. tools like telephony and the internet, distance learning, television, computers, the necessary networks and software to use these technologies. They are revolutionising social, cultural and economic structures by generating new behaviour towards information, knowledge, work, etc.         eInclusion: this concept is linked to the use of information society for all, i.e. a society ensuring equal access to ICT and the same availability at an affordable cost. eInclusion therefore has a double meaning: it aims at ensuring equal access to and the participation of all in the information society; it also aims to implement systems to enable disabled and older people to play an integral role in society and improve their level of independence.         Lisbon Goals: at the European Council in Lisbon (March 2000), the EU set a new strategic target for the decade to come becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. The strategy was designed to allow the Union to regain full employment and to strengthen cohesion by 2010.         Interoperability: interoperability means that several systems, whether they are identical or radically different, can communicate without ambiguity and work together. Interoperability is a very important concept for the global telephony network and the internet which are inherently heterogeneous networks in which different types of equipment are interconnected. Communications must therefore conform to clearly defined and unambiguous standards.

summary of   Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 – the approval and market surveillance of two- or three-wheel vehicles and quadricycles   what is the aim of this regulation   It aims to upgrade the EU’s functional safety and environmental requirements for L-category vehicles as a prerequisite for vehicle registration.   It also applies to enduro motorcycles, trial motorcycles and heavy all-terrain quads that may be used both on- and off-road.   key points    Approval and market surveillance authorities   EU countries must designate    approval authorities  to certify that a given type of vehicle complies with the various administrative and technical requirements that are laid down in the law;    market surveillance authorities  to ensure that vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units on the market comply with the law and do not endanger health, safety or any other aspect of public interest protection.    Type approval   Type-approval requirements address the (vehicle) manufacturers, approval authorities and technical services (e.g. inspection bodies) involved. Once a vehicle complies with a comprehensive set of requirements, a vehicle type may be sold on the EU market.  The manufacturer must deliver a conformity certificate with each vehicle; this allows the owner to register the vehicle.   Functional safety requirements   The regulation lays down safety requirements such as:   new motorcycles of more than 125 cm  3  must be equipped with an anti-lock braking system;   mandatory fitting of an anti-lock brake system, a combined brake system or both on a 2-wheeled motorcycle under 125 cm  3  is left to the manufacturer’s discretion;   from July 2014, for visibility purposes, all new types of L-category vehicles must be fitted with a mechanism that automatically turns on the lights; as of 1 January 2016, all existing types of these vehicles must also comply;   the mandatory fitting of a differential (which allows wheels on the same axle to turn at different rates) on quads and other types of 3- and 4-wheeled L-category vehicles to ensure they can turn corners safely.    Environmental performance requirements   To get type approval, an L-category vehicle has to comply with 8 different test types, such as for evaporative emissions (fuel vapours), pollution control devices, energy efficiency and sound.  The regulation sets environmental requirements for 2 stages of emission reductions. The first stage (Euro 4) is mandatory for new types of vehicles as of 1 January 2016. A second step (Euro 5) will apply as of 2020, allowing manufacturers and suppliers to plan for the medium term. The feasibility of the Euro 5 step will need to be confirmed with a study in 2016 of its potential environmental effects.   Obligations on manufacturers, their representatives, importers and distributors   The regulation details the obligations of those involved in the supply chain, as indicated below.   Where a vehicle presents a serious risk for users or the environment, the manufacturer or other parties in the supply chain must take effective protective measures, including a recall of vehicles.   Manufacturers must provide unrestricted  access to on-board diagnostics  using a standardised connector and to  vehicle repair and maintenance information  through websites to authorised dealers and repairers, as well as to independent operators. This does not apply to ‘small-series’ vehicles.   from when does this regulation apply  It applies from 1 January 2016.  However, as of 11 September 2014, a manufacturer may voluntarily request a vehicle type approval on the basis of Regulation (EU) No 168/2013. Framework Directive 2002/24/EC will be repealed from 1 January 2016. Thereafter, Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 and its delegated and implementing acts will become mandatory.   background   To reduce pollution from transport and to increase the functional safety of new L-category vehicles, the EU adopted a new law in 2013 to replace  Directive 2002/24/EC  as of 1 January 2016. L-category vehicles is the name of a family of light powered vehicles such as powered cycles, 2- and 3-wheeled mopeds, motorcycles (with and without side cars), tricycles and quadricycles.

act   Directive  94/11/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 March 1994 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to labelling of the materials used in the main components of footwear for sale to the consumer   summary    what does this directive do  It lays down the rules for the labelling of footwear:   the content and form of the label;   responsibility for the labelling.   key points    Only materials covering 80 % or more of the surface areas of the upper, the lining and the sock of the footwear, as well as 80 % or more of the volume of the outer sole, need to be labelled. Where no single material accounts for at least 80 %, a label with information on the two main materials must be provided.   The labelling needs to provide information on the three components of the footwear:   the upper;   the lining and sock;   the outer sole.     The label may either be written or in the form of a pictogram.   The label must be visible, securely attached and accessible.   The label should be:   printed or embossed on the footwear; or   attached to the footwear by means of, for example, an adhesive label; or   affixed by means of, for example, a fastener or string.     The label must appear on at least one of the two items comprising the pair of shoes, boots, etc.   EU manufacturers are responsible for supplying the label and for its accuracy or, where the footwear is imported, the person who first places it on the EU market assumes this responsibility. Retailers remain responsible for ensuring that the footwear they sell bears the appropriate labelling.   The annexes specify:   definitions (an upper, a sole, etc.) and corresponding pictograms or written indications concerning the parts of the footwear to be identified (Annex I);   examples of the footwear covered by the directive are contained in Annex II. It does not, for example, cover footwear used by individuals for health and safety purposes in the workplace, which falls under EU rules on  personal protective equipment  .     A voluntary EU  eco-label  also exists for footwear. This label helps consumers identify footwear whose life-cycle (production, use and disposal) has a low environmental impact.

act   Council Directive  70/157/EEC  of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the permissible sound level and the exhaust system of motor vehicles [Official Journal L 42 of 23.02.1970].   summary   The Directives apply to any motor vehicle intended for use on the road, with or without bodywork, having at least four wheels and a maximum design speed exceeding 25 km/h, with the exception of vehicles that run on rails, agricultural and forestry tractors and all mobile machinery.  The Directives lay down limits for the noise level of the mechanical parts and exhaust systems of the vehicles concerned. The limits range from 74 dB(A) for motor cars to 80 dB(A) for high-powered goods vehicles.  Permissible values are drawn up for specific categories of vehicles:   cars;   public transport vehicles;   goods vehicles.   Member States are required to publish noise level values for type-approval by 1 October 1994.  Hence Member States may not, for reasons relating to the permissible sound level and exhaust system:   refuse or prohibit the sale, registration, placing on the market or use of vehicles which comply with the provisions of the Directive;   prohibit the placing on the market of an exhaust system or technical unit if they correspond to a type in respect of which type-approval has been granted.   Tax incentives granted by Member States to encourage new limits to be met in advance may be authorised if they are:   non-discriminatory;   for a limited period;   of an amount which is significantly lower than the cost of the equipment fitted;   applied to vehicles fitted with equipment which enables future European standards to be met in advance.

summary   In January 2012, only  14 %  of board members of major EU publicly listed companies and just  3 %  of the chairpersons of these companies were women.  Although on the EU's political agenda for many years, there is a renewed impetus in the promotion of  gender equality on the boards of the largest listed companies  . In 2010, the  European Commission  adopted its own strategy for equality between women and men. This was followed, in 2011, by its launch of the ‘Women on the board pledge for Europe’ which called on publicly listed companies in Europe to voluntarily commit to increasing women's presence-on their boards to 30 % by 2015 and 40 % by 2020.  Not having noted much progress, except in a few countries which had introduced laws (or had considered doing so), in 2012 the Commission issued a  communication  outlining the state of play in the field, accompanied by a  proposal  for an EU-wide law setting  procedural quotas  .  The communication looks at the reasons  why women are under-represented  in business leadership positions and the main obstacles to their career progression.    Traditional gender roles:  the division of labour, different educational choices (few women in sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) and concentration of women in a few occupational sectors.    Lack of support to balance care responsibilities with work,  which has an unbalanced impact on women’s and men’s work patterns.    Glass ceiling:  women need to overcome preconceptions about requirements for leadership positions, discrimination or stereotyping. ‘Subtle’ barriers may exist such as the perception that women are either not interested or incapable of performing certain tasks or that these posts are ‘male’ jobs.    Lack of transparency in recruitment and promotion practice:  the lack of women in senior positions influences companies’ decisions, including their attitude towards gender equality and the appointment of more female board members. Appointments to boards  rely heavily  on personal and professional contacts of current board members.   It is anticipated that opening the door to senior positions will encourage women to enter and stay in the workforce, thus helping to meet the employment target of 75 % set by the EU’s  Europe 2020 strategy  for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.  The communication suggests complementing the proposed law with a comprehensive approach that would  combine policy measures and financial support  to improve women’s participation in the labour market and in leadership positions. Examples of actions that will be supported are as follows:   initiatives to  combat stereotyped representations  of roles in society, labour market and leadership;   creation of a  social, economic and business environment  supportive of balanced participation in leadership positions;   promotion of the  business and economic case  for gender equality and balanced representation in decision making;   support for and monitoring of  progress towards balanced participation  of women and men in decision-making positions across the EU.   background     Women in economic decision-making in the EU     Women and men in leadership positions in the European Union, 2013    act   Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions — Gender balance in business leadership: a contribution to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth (  COM(2012) 615 final  of 14.11.2012)
summary of   Directive 2003/88/EC – certain aspects of the organisation of working time   what is the aim of this directive  It sets out minimum safety and health requirements for the organisation of the working time of workers. These cover:   minimum periods of daily and weekly rest, annual leave, breaks and maximum weekly working time;   aspects of night and shift work.   key points    EU countries     EU countries  must ensure that all workers are entitled to:   a minimum daily rest period of 11 consecutive hours in every 24;   a rest break in any working day longer than 6 hours;   an uninterrupted 24-hour rest period every 7 days, in addition to the daily 11 hours;   at least 4 weeks paid annual leave;   a maximum average working week of 48 hours, including overtime, over 7 days.     Normal night work should be no more than 8 hours on average in any 24-hour period.   Night workers are entitled to free health checks at regular intervals.    National authorities     National authorities  may:   use reference periods, ranging from 14 days to 4 months, to calculate weekly rest periods and maximum weekly working time;   exempt managing executives, other senior decision makers, family workers and religious officials from the legislation.     Derogations to certain provisions may also apply for any of the following:   security and surveillance activities requiring a permanent presence to protect people or property;   continuity of service or production in areas such as hospitals, docks, airports, the media and agriculture;   a foreseeable surge of activity (notably agriculture, tourism, postal services, railways, accidents);   derogations agreed in collective agreements between employers and employees.     The legislation does not apply to seafarers; nor does it apply to workers covered by more specific rules (such as mobile workers in the road transport, civil aviation, cross-border railway or inland waterway transport sectors).   EU countries may apply more favourable health and safety provisions if they wish.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 2 August 2004.   background    Working Conditions - Working Time Directive
   Joint employment report 2006/2007     Joint employment report 2006/2007     The joint employment report states that the labour market reforms in the European Union (EU) are beginning to bear fruit. Unemployment is falling while employment is rising. Achieving Europe's employment objectives, however, still requires a lot of effort. Whilst investment in education and skills is up, policy implementation to improve the adaptability of workers and enterprises is lagging far behind. This report, like previous reports, emphasises the need for more stringent reforms in order to strike a better balance between flexibility and security in the labour market.     ACT     Joint employment report 2006/2007     SUMMARY     The joint employment report reiterates the main priorities of the European Employment Strategy (       EES      ). It reports on the advances and shortcomings of employment policies since the publication of the       previous joint employment report      .     The EES is built around three priorities:      to attract and retain more people in employment, increase labour supply and modernise social protection systems;       to improve the adaptability of workers and enterprises;       to increase investment in human capital through better education and skills.      Of these priorities, Member States pay the greatest attention to attracting and retaining more people in employment. The implementation of policies to increase investment in human capital through better education and skills is also progressing. Policy implementation to improve the adaptability of workers and enterprises, on the other hand, is lagging behind.     The report emphasises that the poor take-up of policies to improve the adaptability of workers is especially worrying. Reforms of legislation relating to contracts and greater investment in training would allow easier job transitions and provide more opportunities for workers to progress.      Progress in achieving the Community's employment objectives      The report states that the Member States' policies, which are built around the priorities of the EES, should promote the following employment objectives:      full employment;       quality and productivity at work;       social and territorial cohesion.      Unemployment fell from 9.1 % in 2004 to 8,8 % in 2005 and the employment rate rose by 0.8 % in 2005, which is the largest increase since 2001. The employment gender gap narrowed further and there were further increases in employment for older workers, with the employment rate increasing from 41% in 2004 to 42.5% in 2005. 22 million new jobs do, however, still need to be created to achieve the EU's employment objectives by 2010 and youth unemployment still gives cause for concern. Few Member States report on progress in providing the long-term unemployed with active support.     Little improvement has been recorded as regards the quality of work. Youth employment rose in 2005, but other elements of the quality of work showed little progress. The report showed few tangible gains in terms of either the transition from insecure to secure jobs or adult participation in lifelong learning.     To be competitive and ensure sustainable growth, productivity must increase. However, labour productivity growth has been falling in the EU as a whole over the last twenty years, from around 2% a year in the 1980s to 1% in the 1996-2001 period and to below 1% between 2001 and 2003. The situation improved in 2004 (1.9%) but fell back again to 0.9% in 2005.     The Lisbon strategy calls for economic and labour market reforms and for social policies to support economic and employment growth. The report adds that social protection reforms should, where required, improve the sustainability of public finances, particularly by modernising pension systems. The report emphasises that the challenge is to ensure that growth and job creation translate into greater social cohesion.     The report also focuses on territorial cohesion, explaining that regional disparities remain widespread, with very high rates of unemployment in many regions.      A call for delivery      The report stresses that the better functioning of labour markets and quality at work calls for comprehensive measures, which can:      encourage the inactive to enter the labour market;       reward work within the framework of modern social security systems;       facilitate restructuring;       improve workers' adaptability and skills development.      10. The report points out that "flexicurity" should ease the transitions between different stages of working life. "Flexicurity" can be defined, more precisely, as a policy strategy to simultaneously enhance the flexibility of labour markets, work organisations and labour relations on the one hand, and employment and income security on the other. In June 2007, the Commission will present a communication along with extensive consultation in order to set out a range of options to help Member States find the right policy mix for their labour markets.     A reinforced lifecycle-based approach to work should improve access to the labour market, extend working life and promote professional mobility over the life cycle. This measure should in particular lead to an urgent improvement in the situation of young people on the labour market.     The report indicates that due attention should be given to people at the margins of the labour market. Financial incentives which are more attractive than social benefits would create opportunities for the low-skilled. A balanced approach could consist of individually-tailored measures, appropriate minimum wages, targeted payroll tax cuts and the creation of the right environment for the provision of good quality jobs, for example through the development of the personal services market.     To achieve these objectives, effective investment in human capital is indispensable and a breakthrough in lifelong learning is required. The Spring 2006 European Council stated that it was also essential to raise education levels to improve employment opportunities.     The report specifies that migration is an emerging labour market issue which may be relevant in alleviating labour shortages. Several Member States are implementing measures targeted at immigrants or ethnic minorities, but the unemployment rate gapbetween EU and non-EU nationals is still huge.

   White Paper on services of general interest     White Paper on services of general interest     Presented as an extension of the Green Paper on services of general interest, the Commission White Paper describes the European Union's strategy for promoting the development of high-quality services of general interest. It presents the main elements of a strategy aimed at ensuring that all citizens and enterprises in the Union have access to high-quality and affordable services of general interest.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 12 May 2004 entitled "White Paper on services of general interest" [       COM(2004) 374      final - Not yet published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This White Paper presents the Commission's conclusions following a broad       public consultation      launched on the basis of the Green Paper. The consultation showed up significant differences in points of view and outlook. Nevertheless, a consensus seems to have emerged on the need to ensure the harmonious combination of market mechanisms and public service missions. The White Paper sets out the Commission's approach in developing a positive role for the European Union in fostering the development of high-quality services of general interest and presents the main elements of a strategy aimed at ensuring that all citizens and enterprises in the Union have access to high-quality and affordable services.     In submitting this White Paper, the Commission does not intend to close the debate that has developed at European level. Its aim is to make a contribution to the ongoing discussion and take it further by defining the Union's role and a framework that allows these services to function properly.      SERVICES OF GENERAL INTEREST: AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF THE EUROPEAN MODEL AND A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION      The White Paper stresses the importance of services of general interest as one of the pillars of the European model of society and the need to ensure the provision of high-quality and affordable services of general interest to all citizens and enterprises in the European Union. In the Union, services of general interest remain essential for ensuring social and territorial cohesion and for the competitiveness of the European economy.     While the provision of services of general interest can be organised in cooperation with the private sector or entrusted to private or public undertakings, the definition of public service obligations and missions remains a task for the public authorities at the relevant level. The relevant public authorities are also responsible for market regulation and for ensuring that operators accomplish the public service missions entrusted to them.     In this context, the White Paper states that responsibility for services of general interest is shared between the Union and its Member States. This shared responsibility is the concept underlying       Article 16 of the EC Treaty      , which confers responsibility upon the Community and the Member States to ensure, each within their respective powers, that their policies enable operators of services of general economic interest to fulfil their missions. The right of the Member States to assign specific public service obligations to economic operators and to ensure compliance is also implicitly recognised in       Article 86(2) of the EC Treaty      .     The EC Treaty gives the Community a range of resources to ensure that users have access to high-quality, affordable services of general interest in the European Union. The Commission takes the view that its powers are appropriate and sufficient for the maintenance and development of effective services throughout the Union. Nevertheless, it is primarily for the relevant national, regional and local authorities to define, organise, finance and monitor services of general interest.      THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF THE COMMISSION'S APPROACH      The Commission's approach is based on a number of principles that are reflected in the Community's sectoral policies and can be clarified on the basis of the results of the debate on the Green Paper:       Enabling public authorities to operate close to citizens:        The Commission respects the essential role of the Member States and of regional and local authorities in the area of services of general interest. The Community's policies on services of general interest are based on various degrees of action and the use of various instruments, in line with the principle of subsidiarity.        Achieving public service objectives within competitive open markets:        An open and competitive internal market, on the one hand, and the development of high-quality, accessible and affordable services of general interest, on the other, are compatible objectives.        Ensuring cohesion and universal access:        The access of all citizens and enterprises to affordable, high-quality services of general interest throughout the territory of the Member States is essential for the promotion of social and territorial cohesion in the European Union, including the reduction of obstacles caused by the lack of accessibility of the outermost regions.        Maintaining a high level of quality, security and safety:        The Commission wishes to guarantee, in addition to the supply of high-quality services of general interest, the physical safety of consumers and users, everyone involved in the production and delivery of these services and the general public, and, in particular, provide protection against possible threats such as terrorist attacks or environmental disasters.        Ensuring consumer and user rights:        These include, in particular, access to services, in particular cross-border services, throughout the territory of the Union and for all groups of the population, affordability of services, including special schemes for persons on low incomes, physical safety, security and reliability, continuity, high quality, choice, transparency and access to information from providers and regulators.        Monitoring and evaluating performance:        The Commission takes the view that systematic evaluation and monitoring is vital for maintaining and developing high-quality, accessible, affordable and efficient services of general interest in the European Union. The evaluation should be multidimensional and focus on all the legal, economic, social and environmental aspects. It should also take into account the features of the sector evaluated and situations specific to the various Member States and their regions.        Respecting the diversity of services and situations:        The diversity of services must be maintained because of the different needs and preferences of users and consumers resulting from different economic, social, geographical or cultural situations. This is true in particular for social services, health care and broadcasting.        Increasing transparency:        The principle of transparency is a key concept for the development and implementation of public policies regarding services of general interest. It ensures that public authorities can exercise their responsibilities and that democratic choices can be made and are respected. The principle should apply to all aspects of delivery and cover the definition of public service missions, the organisation, financing and regulation of services, as well as their production and evaluation, including complaint-handling mechanisms.        Providing legal certainty:        The Commission is aware that the application of Community law to services of general interest could raise complex issues. It is therefore going to pursue an ongoing project to improve legal certainty associated with the application of Community law in the provision of services of general interest. It has already accomplished the modernisation of the existing public procurement rules and launched initiatives in the areas of state aid and public-private partnerships.       NEW APPROACHES FOR A COHERENT POLICY      One of the main questions in the public discussion concerned the need for a framework directive on services of general interest. The views expressed on this subject in the public consultation were divided, a number of Member States and the European Parliament being sceptical on the issue.     It is therefore uncertain whether a framework directive would be the best route to follow at this stage and would bring sufficient added value. Consequently, the Commission concludes that it would be best not to present a proposal for the time being. Rather, it will pursue and develop its sectoral approach by proposing, where necessary and appropriate, sector-specific rules that allow account to be taken of the specific requirements and situations in each sector.     The Commission will re-examine the feasibility and necessity of a framework law on services of general interest when the Constitutional Treaty comes into force, in particular the new legal basis introduced by Article III-122 which states that: "Without prejudice to Articles III-55, III-56 and III-136, and given the place occupied by services of general economic interest as services to which all in the Union attribute value as well as their role in promoting social and territorial cohesion, the Union and the Member States, each within their respective powers and within the scope of application of the Constitution, shall take care that such services operate on the basis of principles and conditions, in particular economic and financial, which enable them to fulfil their missions. European laws shall define these principles and conditions." In addition, the Commission will review the situation of services of general interest in the European Union and the need for any horizontal measures in 2005. It plans to present a report of its findings by the end of 2005.     On the basis of the results of the public consultation, the Commission also considers it necessary to further clarify and simplify the legal framework for the financing of public service obligations. It intends to adopt a package of measures to that effect by July 2005 at the latest. Most elements of this package have already been submitted as drafts for consultation.     Furthermore, the public debate highlighted the need for a clear and transparent framework for the selection of undertakings entrusted with a service of general interest. The Commission intends to examine the EU legislation ensuring the transparent award of service concessions. It has therefore launched a consultation on the procurement aspects of public-private partnerships.     The Green Paper also generated considerable interest among stakeholders in the area of social and health services, who expressed a need for greater predictability and clarity to ensure a smooth development of these services. The Commission takes the view that it is useful to develop a systematic approach in order to identify and recognise the specific characteristics of social and health services of general interest and to clarify the framework in which they operate and can be modernised. This approach will be set out in a Communication on social services of general interest, including health services, to be adopted in the course of 2005.     Evaluating the operation of the services, at both Community and national level, is essential to ensure the development of high-quality services of general interest that are accessible and affordable in an environment undergoing constant change. The Commission has undertaken to intensify and improve its evaluation activities in the field of services of general interest.     On an internal level, the sectoral regulations put in place at Community level concern the large network industries. In the Commission's view, the public consultation on the Green Paper has confirmed this approach. It will take into account the results of this consultation in the examinations of the various sectors.     On an international level, the Commission is determined to ensure consistency between the Community's internal rules and the obligations on itself and the Member States pursuant to international trade agreements. It also wishes to promote services of general interest in development co-operation.     RELATED ACTS      European Parliament Resolution of 13 January 2004 on the Green Paper on services of general interest [A5-0484/2003].      Parliament welcomes the Commission Green Paper and calls on the Commission to present a follow-up by April 2004 at the latest. It takes the view that certain services of general interest should be excluded from the scope of the competition rules, including health, education and social housing, as well as services of general interest aiming to maintain or increase plurality of information and cultural diversity. Moreover, Parliament calls on the Commission to defend this position at WTO negotiations and negotiations on the General Agreement on Trade in Services. It considers that it is neither possible nor relevant to draw up common definitions of services of general interest, or of the public-service obligations resulting from them, but that the European Union must lay down common principles, including the following: universality and equality of access, continuity, security and adaptability; quality, efficiency and affordability, transparency, protection of less well-off social groups, protection of users, consumers and the environment, and citizen participation, taking into account circumstances which are specific to each sector. It stresses the need to ensure that competition rules are compatible with public service obligations, and is opposed to liberalisation of the water supply. Parliament takes the view that water and waste services should not be subject to Community sectoral directives, but that the Union should keep its full responsibility for these sectors as regards quality and environment protection standards.      Commission Green Paper of 21 May 2003 on services of general interest [         COM(2003) 270        final - Official Journal C 76 of 25.03.2004].      The Commission, in this Green Paper, undertakes to conduct a complete review of its policies on services of general interest. Its objective is to organise an open debate on the global role of the Union in the definition of the objectives of general interest pursued by these services and on how they are organised, funded and evaluated. The Green Paper also reaffirms the significant contribution of the internal market and competition rules to modernising and improving the quality and efficiency of many public services, to the benefit of Europe's citizens and businesses. It deals with globalisation and liberalisation, raising the question of whether a general legislative framework should be established at Community level for services of general interest, and seeks to deal with these issues by asking questions about: the impact of any additional Community initiatives to implement the treaty, in full respect of the principle of subsidiarity; the principles likely to be incorporated in any framework legislation on services of general interest and the actual added value of legislation of that kind; the definition of good governance in the organisation, regulation, funding and evaluation of services of general interest; an examination of any new measure likely to be taken to increase legal certainty and facilitate consistent, harmonious coordination between the objective of safeguarding high-quality services of general interest and the rigorous application of the competition and internal market rules.

act   Directive  2000/30/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 June 2000 on the technical roadside inspection of the roadworthiness of commercial vehicles circulating in the Community   summary   This directive sets out the legal framework and supplements the rules on mandatory annual checks at testing stations for on-road commercial vehicles, under  Directive 2009/40/EC  (which repealed Directive 96/96/EC in 2009, and which has itself been repealed by  Directive 2014/45/EU  , taking effect on 20 May 2018).  Roadside checks are unannounced checks on a commercial vehicle travelling within a European Union (EU) country. They are carried out by the authorities on roads, in ports, or anywhere else considered appropriate.  This directive provides that a technical roadside inspection shall comprise 1, 2 or all of the following aspects:        —     a visual check on the state of maintenance of the vehicle running on the road network;            —     a check on the documents relating to the compliance of the vehicle with a technical roadside inspection and, if the driver presents it, a recent roadside technical inspection report;            —     a check to uncover poor maintenance (smooth tyres, faulty braking system, etc.). In this instance, the inspector should take the most recent documents and any other safety certificate into consideration.      The directive provides for the introduction by the EU countries of regular, appropriate roadside checks to be carried out without discrimination as to the driver’s nationality or vehicle registration. Every year these should cover a significant, representative cross-section of commercial vehicles of all categories.  Every 2 years, the EU countries must send the Commission information on the 2 previous years concerning the number of commercial vehicles checked.  The roadside checks provided for in the directive must be carried out in accordance with a checklist (Annex I). A certificate setting out the results of the spot check is to be handed to the driver of the vehicle. The driver must be in a position to present this on request in order to simplify or avoid subsequent checks.  If the extent of poor maintenance requires a more detailed examination, the vehicle may be subjected to a closer inspection in an approved roadworthiness testing station.  The use of a commercial vehicle on the public highway is immediately banned:        —     if the results of a roadside check show that it does not meet the standards set out in the directive (Annex II: Braking systems, exhaust emissions), or            —     if it is shown not to comply with Directive 2009/40/EC during a subsequent roadworthiness test at an approved testing centre and            —     if it therefore constitutes a major risk to its occupants or other road users.      Serious deficiencies of a vehicle belonging to a non-resident must be reported to the authorities in the EU country where the vehicle is registered. The country in which the deficiency has been found may then request that action be taken against the offender. Where such action is taken, the country of registration must inform the country in which the deficiency has been noted of the action taken against the offender concerned.  The Commission has the power to define certain minimum standards and methods for testing and to adapt them to technical progress.

   Cooperation with the African Centre for Study and Research on Terrorism     Cooperation with the African Centre for Study and Research on Terrorism     The European Union is offering its support to the African Centre for Study and Research on Terrorism. The objective of this Joint Action is for the Member States of the African Union to cooperate more and improve the organisation of their capacities in the fight against terrorism. This Joint Action comes within the framework of the implementation of the European Union counter-terrorism strategy.     ACT     Council Joint Action       2007/501/CFSP      of 16 July 2007 on cooperation with the African Centre for Study and Research on Terrorism in the framework of the implementation of the European Union counter-terrorism strategy.     SUMMARY     This Joint Action offers the support of the European Union (EU) to the Member States of the       African Union      (AU). Its objective is to improve the organisation of the capacities of the Member States of the AU in the fight against terrorism and to strengthen cooperation, in particular through the exchange of information.     The EU undertakes to provide financial support to the       African Centre for Study and Research on Terrorism      (ACSRT) with a view to improving the efficiency of the counter-terrorism arrangements of the African countries.      African Centre for Study and Research on Terrorism      Since its creation in 2004, the ACSRT has been responsible for evaluating the terrorist threat in Africa and for promoting intra-African cooperation against terrorism. It deals more specifically with carrying out training measures, conducting studies, setting up databases for gathering, exchanging and analysing information, as well as for terrorism-related surveillance and alerts.      Project      The project consists in carrying out audit missions on national counter-terrorism arrangements and providing advice on reorganisation in the AU Member States. To achieve this, an action plan, drawn up by the EU, will be presented at the next seminar in Addis Ababa.     This seminar will bring together two representatives from the 53 countries of the AU, Morocco, the       United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime      (UNODC), the ACSRT and each EU Member State, as well as the EU Counter-terrorism Coordinator.     At the close of the seminar, the African States will declare whether they wish to receive an audit mission or not. The audit teams will be made up of two specialists from the EU Member States and one member of the ACSRT and will be responsible for drawing up reports containing recommendations. If they are accepted by the audited countries, the latter will implement them, with monitoring by the ACSRT.     In parallel, the evaluations recording the possible improvements are forwarded to the ACSRT, which in turn sends them to the Council for communication to the Member States. On the basis of these evaluations, the ACSRT, with the agreement of the EU, can make recommendations to the audited countries.      Implementation      The Presidency, assisted by the Secretary-General of the Council/       High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy      (CFSP), is responsible for the implementation of this Joint Action.     The ACSRT is responsible for:      the technical implementation of the project;       the organisation of the Addis Ababa seminar;       contact with the States which have accepted the action plan;       proper management of the audit missions in operational and financial terms;       coordination of the project;       drawing up regular project evaluation reports.      The Council and the Commission ensure consistency between the implementation of this Joint Action and other external activities of the Community.      Terms and conditions      The project implementation budget amounts to EUR 665 000. The Commission is responsible for supervising the proper management of expenditure, supplying the information relating to the financial aspects, concluding a financing agreement with the ACSRT and informing the Council of any difficulties.     The Joint Action enters into force on the day of its adoption and expires 18 months after the conclusion of the financing agreement or on 16 July 2008, if no agreement has been concluded before that date.      Background      This Joint Action is part of the EU       counter-terrorism strategy      , the       EU's strategy for Africa      , the Plan of Action on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism in Africa and the Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism, signed in Algiers.

   Readmission agreements with the countries of the western Balkans     Readmission agreements with the countries of the western Balkans     The agreements signed between the European Community and the countries of the western Balkans aim to facilitate the readmission, at the request of one or other signatory, of persons who have not been authorised, or are no longer authorised, to reside in such countries or in a Member State of the European Union (EU). They concern not only nationals of the State to which a request is addressed, but also any individual who has illegally entered the requesting State from the requested State.     ACT     Council Decision       2005/809/EC      of 7 November 2005 concerning the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Albania on the readmission of persons residing without authorisation.     Council Decisions       2007/817/EC      , 2007/818/EC, 2007/819/EC and 2007/820/EC of 8 November 2007 on the conclusion of Agreements between the European Community and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Republic of Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina on the readmission of persons residing without authorisation.     SUMMARY     Any western Balkan country which is not a member of the European Union (EU) and has signed a readmission agreement ("partner country") shall readmit, at the request of a Member State, its nationals who do not comply with, or no longer comply with, the entry or residence conditions of that State. It agrees to readmit the person concerned if it is proven, or can be validly assumed, that he/she is a national of that country.     The partner country shall also readmit any third-country national who does not comply with, or no longer complies with, the entry or residence conditions of the requesting Member State if it is proven, or can be validly assumed, that the person in question entered directly and illegally into the Member State after staying in, or transiting through, the partner country.     The European Community (EC) has a similar commitment to the partner country: following a request from the authorities of the partner country, a Member State shall readmit any of its nationals who do not comply with, or no longer comply with, the conditions for entry or residence in the partner country, if it is proven, or can be validly assumed, that the person in question is a national of that Member State.     A Member State shall also readmit any third-country national who holds a visa or residence permit issued by that Member State or who has entered illegally and directly into the partner country after staying in, or transiting through, that Member State.      Readmission application      Any transfer of an individual to be readmitted must follow an application known as a "readmission application" submitted by the requesting State to the requested State. However, no application is required when the person is in possession of a valid travel document or an identity card and, where necessary, a visa or a residence permit issued by the requested State.     Readmission applications must include the following information and documentation concerning the person concerned: surname, forenames, date and place of birth, last place of residence, documents attesting his/her nationality, photograph, a note as to whether he/she requires help or care and information on any other protection or security measure which may be necessary for his/her transfer.      Evidence      For the readmission of nationals of the partner country or Member States, readmission agreements list the documents which make it possible to establish:      proof of nationality without any further investigation being required;       prima facie evidence of nationality. In such cases, the Member States and the partner country shall consider that nationality has been established unless there is proof to the contrary.      For the readmission of third-country nationals, the readmission agreements list the documents which constitute evidence making it possible to establish:      proof that the readmission conditions have been fulfilled;       prima facie evidence that the readmission conditions have been fulfilled. In such cases, the Member States and the partner country shall consider that the readmission conditions have been fulfilled unless there is proof to the contrary.       Time limits      The requesting State must submit readmission applications for third-country nationals at most one year after becoming aware of the facts.     Replies to applications shall be provided in writing within a set time limit (e.g. 10 days for the readmission agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina, 12 days for the readmission agreement with Montenegro, 14 days for the readmission agreement with Albania) from the date of receipt of the readmission application. For some readmission agreements, such as those with Serbia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, this time limit is reduced if the individual is apprehended in the border region of the requesting State. By contrast, it may also be extended by a maximum of six days in certain circumstances.     If there is no reply within the extended time limit, the transfer shall be deemed to have been approved. If the application is rejected, the readmission shall not take place. Rejection decisions must be justified by the requested State. If the application is accepted, the readmission shall take place. In principle, transfers are organised within the three months following acceptance. This deadline may be extended.      How transfers take place      Before repatriating a person, the authorities of the partner country and the Member State concerned shall agree matters in advance in writing, particularly as regards the date of the transfer, the entry point and any escorts which may be required.     Repatriation may take place by air or over land. Air transport may take place on scheduled or charter flights.      Costs      In readmission operations, all transport costs as far as the border of the State of final destination shall be borne by the requesting State.      Joint committees      Joint committees are set up to monitor implementation of each agreement.      Background      Following the outcome of the EU-Western Balkans summit in Thessaloniki on 21 June 2003 ("Thessaloniki Agenda"), the EU institutions began negotiations with a view to concluding readmission agreements with all the countries in the region.     On 13 November 2006, the Council authorised the Commission to begin negotiating readmission agreements with Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. These negotiations led to the adoption by the Council on 8 November 2007 of Decisions providing for the conclusion of the agreements.     As regards Albania, the process dates back further. On 28 November 2002, the Council authorised the Commission to begin negotiations on a readmission agreement. These negotiations led to the adoption by the Council of a Decision providing for the conclusion of the agreement.

   Programme of Community action in the field of consumer policy (2007-2013)     Programme of Community action in the field of consumer policy (2007-2013)     The European Union has established a financial framework of 156.8 million to support consumer policy during the period 31 December 2006 to 31 December 2013. This will finance 11 initiatives designed to ensure a high level of consumer protection and effective application of the rules pertaining to this policy area.     ACT     Decision No       1926/2006/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 establishing a       programme of Community action in the field of consumer policy      (2007-2013).     SUMMARY     This Decision establishes a programme of Community action in the field of consumer policy (2007-2013) as well its financing, which amounts to 156.8 million for the entire 27 EU Member States.     The action programme for 2007-2013 replaces the previous one running from 2004-2007.     The aim of the programme is to complement, support and monitor the policies of the Member States and to contribute to protecting consumers' health, safety and economic and legal interests, as well as to promote their right to information and education and to organise themselves so as better to safeguard their interests.     This aim is pursued through two objectives:      ensuring a high level of consumer protection, notably through better consultation with consumers and better representation of their interests;       ensuring the effective application of consumer protection rules, in particular through cooperation on enforcement, information, education and redress.      Eleven actions are defined for the implementation of these two objectives, including, for the first objective, the collection, exchange and analysis of data and information, the development of assessment tools, legal and technical expertise including studies, seminars and conferences, and contributions to the functioning of European consumer organisations.     The actions under the second objective concern the effective application of Community legislation through coordinated surveillance and cooperation between national authorities; monitoring and assessment of the safety of non-food products and services; information, advice and redress actions; consumer education actions.      Financial participation      The beneficiaries of financial support are public bodies and private non-profit-making bodies in the Member States, designated by the competent authority or Member State concerned using a transparent procedure.     In line with the cases described in Article 4 of Decision No       1926/2006/EC      [OJ L 404 of 30 December 2006], beneficiaries may be higher education institutions, students or teachers, officials responsible for enforcing consumer protection legislation, or European consumer organisations.      Annual work plan      The programme for 2007-2013 is based on an annual work plan prepared by the Commission and ratified by the Member States through the Consumer Financial Programme Committee (CFPC) in accordance with Article 10 of the Decision. The 27 Member States are members of the Committee. The EFTA/EEA countries (Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein) contribute to the financing of the programme and participate in Committee meetings, but do not vote on the annual plan.     The Commission will evaluate the programme three years after its start, i.e. at the beginning of 2010, and following its end in 2013.     For more information on the programme of Community action in the field of consumer policy (2007-2013), please consult the website of the       Directorate-General for Health and Consumer Protection.

   Essential medicines for developing countries (HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria)     Essential medicines for developing countries (HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria)     This purpose of this Regulation is to achieve the objectives of the " Programme for Action:       Accelerated action on HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB      in the context of poverty reduction" by setting up a system enabling pharmaceutical producers to sell developing countries essential medicines at reduced prices while ensuring that these products do not find their way back to the EU. The ultimate goal is to give the developing countries greater access to the essential medicines they need to fight the major communicable diseases.     ACT     Council Regulation (EC)       953/2003      of 26 May 2003 to avoid trade diversion into the European Union of certain key medicines.     SUMMARY      Scope      This Regulation applies to any pharmaceutical product used in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of the following communicable diseases: HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. It does not apply to goods of a non-commercial nature contained in travellers' personal luggage for personal use within the limits laid down in respect of relief from customs duty.     The list of countries of destination can be found in Annex 2 to the Regulation. There are 76 countries listed.      Principle of tiered pricing      In order for pharmaceutical products to qualify as tiered priced products, their manufacturers or exporters of products must submit applications to the Commission. This application must specify:      the product's name and composition as well as sufficient information to verify which disease it is preventing, diagnosing or treating;       the proposed price;       the countries of destination.      If the Commission, assisted by a committee of representatives of the Member States, decides that the application fulfils the criteria set out in the Regulation, the product is added to Annex 1 and the applicant informed within 15 days of the date of the decision.      Setting tiered prices      When setting a tiered price, the applicant manufacturer or exporter has two options:      25 % of the average ex-factory price charged in OECD markets;       the direct production costs plus 15 %.       General obligation      It is illegal to import into the Community tiered priced products for the purposes of entry, release for free circulation, re-export, placing under suspensive procedures or placing in a free-zone or free warehouse.      Identification of tiered priced products: marking with a logo      Once a product has been approved as a tiered priced product the manufacturer and exporter affix a logo (see Annex 5) on all packaging, products and documents used in connection with the approved product.     Manufacturers and exporters of tiered priced products sold in the poorest developing countries may, in addition, identify these products by affixing the text "Approved as tiered priced product by EC under Regulation ……." in any of the official languages of the European Union on any packaging or by differentiating the product in a way as may seem fit.     Any additional information (means of transport, trading routes, batch-numbers, etc.) available to the exporter should be made available to the customs authorities to assist them in identifying tiered priced products.      Controls performed by the Member States' customs authorities      The customs authorities will suspend the release of, or detain, tiered priced products for as long as is necessary to obtain a final decision from the competent authorities on the nature of the goods in question.     If imported products are recognised by the competent authority as tiered priced products, that authority will issue a decision instructing the customs authority to destroy these products unless the importer is prepared to make the goods available for humanitarian purposes to the benefit of countries listed in Annex 2. Destruction is normally carried out at the expense of the importer but in any case without cost to the exchequer.     Where imported products are found not to qualify as tiered priced products as defined in this Regulation, the competent authority issues a decision to that effect enabling the customs authority to release the products to the consignee.      Monitoring the volume of exports of tiered priced products      Manufacturers and exporters are obliged to submit annual reports to the Commission on the volume of sales of each tiered priced product. On the basis of these reports, the Commission reports to the Council on the volumes exported.      Intellectual property law      This regulation has been laid down in parallel with the debate in the WTO's TRIPs (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) Council on the possibility of allowing the developing countries, in health emergencies, to obtain compulsory licences to manufacture the medicines they need.     If the countries in question obtain the medicines they need through tiered pricing, as the proposal for a Regulation suggests, they will not need such compulsory licences.

summary of   Regulation (EU) 2016/679 — protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data   what is the aim of the regulation   It allows European Union (EU) citizens to better control their personal data. It also modernises and unifies rules allowing businesses to reduce red tape and to benefit from greater consumer trust.   The general data protection regulation (GDPR) is part of the  EU data protection reform package  , along with the  data protection directive for police and criminal justice authorities  .   key points    Citizens’ rights   The GDPR strengthens existing rights, provides for new rights and gives citizens more control over their personal data. These include:    easier access to their data  — including providing more information on how that data is processed and ensuring that that information is available in a clear and understandable way;    a newright to data portability  — making it easier to transmit personal data between service providers;   a clearer  right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’)  — when an individual no longer wants their data processed and there is no legitimate reason to keep it, the data will be deleted;    right to know when their personal data has been hacked  — companies and organisations will have to inform individuals promptly of serious data breaches. They will also have to notify the relevant data protection supervisory authority.    Rules for businesses   The GDPR is designed to create business opportunities and stimulate innovation through a number of steps including:    a single set of EU-wide rules  — a single EU-wide law for data protection is estimated to make savings of €2.3 billion per year;   a  data protection officer,  responsible for data protection, will be designated by public authorities and by businesses which process data on a large scale;    one-stop-shop  — businesses only have to deal with one single supervisory authority (in the EU country in which they are mainly based);    EU rules for non-EU companies  — companies based outside the EU must apply the same rules when offering services or goods, or monitoring behaviour of individuals within the EU;    innovation-friendly rules  — a guarantee that data protection safeguards are built into products and services from the earliest stage of development (data protection by design and by default);    privacy-friendly techniques  such as  pseudonymisation  (when identifying fields within a data record are replaced by one or more artificial identifiers) and  encryption  (when data is coded in such a way that only authorised parties can read it);    removal of notifications  — the new data protection rules will scrap most notification obligations and the costs associated with these. One of the aims of the data protection regulation is to remove obstacles to free flow of personal data within the EU. This will make it easier for businesses to expand;    impact assessments  — businesses will have to carry out impact assessments when data processing may result in a high risk for the rights and freedoms of individuals;    record-keeping  — SMEs are not required to keep records of processing activities, unless the processing is regular or likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of the person whose data is being processed.    Review   The  European Commission  must submit a report on the evaluation and review of the regulation by 25 May 2020.   from when does the regulation apply  The GDPR will apply as of 25 May 2018.   background   For more information, see:    Press release  (  European Commission  )    ‘2018 reform of EU data protection rules’  (  European Commission  ).   Following the COVID-19 outbreak and introducing measures to cope with the impact of the crisis, the European Commission adopted:    Commission Recommendation (EU) 2020/518 of 8 April 2020 on a common Union toolbox for the use of technology and data to combat and exit from the COVID-19 crisis, in particular concerning mobile applications and the use of anonymised mobility data
summary of   Decision 95/308/EC on the conclusion of the Convention on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses and international lakes    Convention on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses and international lakes   what is the aim of the decision and the convention  With Decision 95/308/EC the European Community (now  EU  ) joins the Convention on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses  *  and international lakes (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe — UNECE Water Convention).  This is known as the Helsinki convention, as it was signed there in 1992.   key points    The convention provides a legal framework within which 2 or more parties may cooperate to:   prevent and control water pollution across national frontiers;   ensure the reasonable and impartial use of transboundary waters.     Parties must take all appropriate transboundary water measures to:   prevent, control and reduce actual or potential pollution;   ensure ecologically reliable water management, conservation of resources and environmental protection, including restoration of ecosystems, where necessary;   ensure the reasonable and impartial use of resources.     Parties must:   apply the precautionary principle, i.e. not fail to act because science has not yet fully proved a causal link between particular substances and pollution;   apply the polluter pays principle, i.e. the party responsible for causing pollution pays the prevention, control and reduction costs;   manage water resources so that future generations' needs are not harmed;   establish programmes to monitor transboundary water;   cooperate with each other, especially on information exchange and research to develop effective techniques to prevent, control and reduce transboundary pollution;   support international efforts to draw up rules, criteria and procedures for determining responsibility and liability for any pollution.     The measures must:   be taken at source, where possible;   not directly or indirectly transfer pollution to other parts of the environment.     Agreements between 2 or more parties may cover issues such as:   compilation of data and inventories;   creation of joint monitoring programmes;   adoption of emission limits for waste water and joint water-quality objectives;   introduction of warning and alarm procedures;   use of environmental impact assessments.     Parties to an agreement must:   provide each other any help when requested;   ensure information on the state of transboundary water and any measures taken are available to the public.     In 2003, the convention was amended to allow non-European countries to join. The amendment entered into force on 6 February 2013 and Decision  2013/790/EU  marked its acceptance. Since March 2016 all UN Member States can accede to it.   date of entry into force   The convention entered into force on 6 October 1996.   background   Most environmental problems cross national borders and may even be global in nature. This is why the Lisbon Treaty (  Article 191  of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) tasks the EU with promoting international measures to tackle regional or worldwide environmental problems.  The EU is competent for negotiating and signing international environmental agreements. It has done so in many areas, whether under the auspices of the  United Nations  or at regional or sub-regional level. It has ratified 6 conventions dealing with water.  For more information, see:    Multilateral environmental agreements  (  European Commission  )    About the UNECE Water Convention  (  United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, UNECE  )    Guide to Implementing The Water Convention  (  United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, UNECE  )   key terms    Transboundary watercourse:  surface or ground water which marks, crosses or is located on boundaries between 2 or more countries.   main documents   Council Decision  95/308/EC  of 24 July 1995 on the conclusion, on behalf of the Community, of the Convention on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses and international lakes (OJ L 186, 5.8.1995, pp. 42-58)   Convention  on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses and international lakes (OJ L 186, 5.8.1995, pp. 44-58)  Successive amendments to the Convention have been incorporated into the original document.

summary of   Regulation (EU) No 1233/2011 on the application of certain guidelines in the field of officially supported export credits   what is the aim of this regulation  It ensures that the EU applies the  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD)  arrangement laying down rules under which the national export credit agencies can offer financial support to their exporters.  The terms are set out in the non-binding  Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits  , known as ‘the Arrangement’, the latest edition of which was published in January 2019. They are intended to guarantee a level playing field for officially supported export credits in the international markets.  The regulation replaces Decisions  2001/76/EC  (officially supported export credits) and  2001/77/EC  (framework agreement on project finance in the field of officially supported export credits).   key points   The OECD Arrangement:   aims to encourage competition among exporters based on the quality and price of goods and services exported, not on the most favourable financial terms and conditions they could obtain from their governments;   applies to all official support by, or on behalf of, a government for the export of goods and/or services, including financial leases, with a repayment period of 2 or more years;   identifies the following different types of official support and sets clear limits on their use   export credit guarantees or insurance   financing, such as direct credit or interest rate assistance    tied aid   *  and trade-related untied aid;     contains specific conditions for   ships   nuclear power plants   civil aircraft   renewable energy, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and water projects   rail infrastructure   coal-fired electricity generation projects;     does not apply to exports of military equipment and agricultural commodities.   The  European Commission  :   has had the power, since 9 December 2011, to use  delegated acts  , under certain conditions, to incorporate directly into EU law any changes to the OECD Arrangement;   produces an  annual review  for the  European Parliament  on the information it receives in the national annual activity reports (see below);   has provided the European Parliament, since 2011, with an  annual report  on its international negotiations to establish global standards on officially supported export credits.   In the interests of transparency, EU countries must send the Commission an annual  activity report  detailing:   assets and liabilities;   claims paid and recoveries;   new commitments;   exposures;   premium charges;   environmental risks and how they are taken into account.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 9 December 2011.   background   The OECD Arrangement came into effect on 1 April 1978 and is open-ended. It is a voluntary, rather than legally binding, agreement among the participants. While not an official OECD act, it has the organisation’s administrative support.  In addition to the EU, the following countries participate in the Arrangement: Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and the United States.  Current participants may invite other OECD members and non-members to join the Arrangement.   key terms    Tied aid:  money granted or lent to a country with conditions on how it is spent.
summary of   Communication (COM(2014) 335 final) — A decent life for all: from vision to collective action   what is the aim of the communication   It seeks to contribute to the European Union (EU) position in international negotiations on the  2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development  .   The 2030 Agenda aims at reinforcing the international community’s commitment to  eradicating poverty  and  supporting sustainable development  .   key points    Main objectives    The communication describes the  key principles  , the  priority areas  and the  potential targets  for a  new integrated agenda  stemming from the follow-up to the  Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  , the  Rio +20  and  Monterrey  conferences.   The  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  should contribute to a new international framework that will succeed the MDGs in the context of a  new global partnership  between all countries, as well as with civil society (for example, citizens acting collectively) and the private sector.    Principles    The EU’s vision for the 2030 Agenda (during the negotiation phase prior to adoption) was that it should aim to  eradicate extreme poverty  and to put the world on a sustainable path, thus ensuring a decent life for all by 2030.   The EU position during the negotiations was that the 2030 Agenda must be:   based on the 3 dimensions of sustainable development: social, environmental and economic;   global in its ambition and applicable to all countries;   based on national ownership, taking into account different national contexts, capacities and levels of development;   rights-based and people-centred.      Priority areas and targets    The priority areas identified were aimed at contributing to the global discussions taking place within the  United Nations (UN) Open Working Group on the Sustainable Development Goals  . These priority areas included:   poverty;   inequality;   health;   food security;   education;   gender equality;   water and sanitation;   sustainable energy;   decent work;   inclusive and sustainable growth;   sustainable consumption and production;   biodiversity;   land degradation; and   sea and oceans.     The EU also wanted to see the 2030 Agenda address justice, equality and equity, good governance, democracy and the rule of law, as well as peaceful societies and freedom from violence.    Mobilising the necessary financial resources   Given the challenges, full use needs to be made of all available resources:    1.     internal resources  by improving tax policy and administration, combating illicit flows and corruption and enhancing natural resources management;      2.     international support  to access additional resources and investment, such as blending different forms of finance;      3.     private sector  to support inclusive and sustainable growth.     The EU called on EU countries to confirm the target of 0.7 % of their gross national product committed to official development assistance by 2015.   background   For more information, see:    ‘International issues’  on the European Commission's website.
summary of   Regulation (EU) No 1011/2012 concerning statistics on holdings of securities (ECB/2012/24)    Guideline 2013/215/EU concerning statistics on holdings of securities (ECB/2013/7)   what is the aim of the regulation and the guideline   The regulation sets out the rules for the collection by the  European Central Bank (ECB)  of comprehensive statistical information on:   the  exposure  of economic sectors and individual banking groups in euro area countries to specific classes of securities;   the  links  between the economic sectors of holders and issuers of securities;   the  market for securities  issued by euro area residents.     The guideline:   sets out the  obligations of the national central banks (NCBs)  of the countries whose currency is the euro to report to the ECB statistics on holdings of securities to be collected; and   establishes a  system for data quality management  of these statistics designed to ensure the completeness, accuracy and consistency of statistics collected.     key points   The ECB collects securities holdings statistics (SHS) on a security-by-security basis. These data provide information on securities held by selected categories of euro area investors, broken down by instrument type, issuer country, investor country, currency of denomination and further classifications.  The  regulation  :   defines the  actual reporting population  as consisting of sectoral data reporting agents  *  and group data reporting agents  *  ;   sets out the respective  statistical reporting requirements  for sectoral data reporting agents and group data reporting agents (further details are contained in the regulation’s Annex I), as well as more general statistical reporting requirements which are in line with Regulation (EU) No  1073/2013  , Regulation (EU) No  1075/2013  and Regulation (EU) No  1374/2014  ;   it lists the  rules applicable to derogations  and the  instances  in which  NCBs may grant derogations  for:   sectoral data reporting agents; and   group data reporting agents (updated by amending Regulation (EU)  2018/318  );     sets out  accounting rules  for the reporting of sectoral data and of group data, as well as general accounting rules;   fixes the  deadlines for the transmission by NCBs of the data  to the ECB;   sets out the rules regarding  minimum standards for reporting  (specified in Annex III);   requires NCBs to define and implement the  reporting arrangements  to be followed by the actual reporting agents in accordance with national characteristics;   lays down the  procedures  to be following in the event of a  merger, division or reorganisation  that might affect the fulfilment of statistical obligations;   grants the NCBs the  rights to verify  or to  compulsorily collect  the information when reporting agents do not fulfil the minimum standards in Annex III.   The regulation has  3 annexes  :    I: Statistical reporting requirements  ;    II: Definitions  (of instrument categories, sectors, financial transactions, security-by-security attributes, holder attributes, issuer attributes, and accounting and risk-related attributes);    III: Minimum standards  to be applied by the actual reporting population.    Amendments to the regulation   The main changes introduced by amending Regulations (EU)  2016/1384  and (EU)  2018/318  extended the data collection in order to comprise more banking groups and more attributes starting with data relating to the reference period end-September 2018. The reporting population was also increased to cover all banking groups that are directly supervised by the ECB.  The  guideline  contains:   further rules governing  NCBs’ reporting obligations  (depending on whether they have an International Securities Identification Number (ISIN)  *  for sectoral data);    reporting approaches for holdings of securities  (depending on whether they have an ISIN, their issuer, etc.);   approaches for  compiling statistics  on holdings of  securities held in custody  ;   a requirement for NCBs to inform the ECB, at least once a year, of the  derogations  granted to, renewed or withdrawn from reporting agents for the following calendar year, as well as any  ad hoc  reporting requirements imposed on actual reporting agents that have been granted a derogation;   reference data on  reporting groups’ consolidated balance sheet assets  ;    notification procedure  to group reporting agents;   rules concerning:   a  review procedure  by the  ECB General Council  ;    monitoring and verifying statistics  ; and    transmission standards  .      Amendments to the guideline    Guideline (EU)  2016/1386  introduced data quality management targets and revised the procedures to be followed by the NCBs when reporting to the ECB.   Guideline (EU)  2018/323  clarified the scope of group data reporting agents and the letter of notification of classification as group data reporting agent.   from when do the regulation and guideline apply  The regulation has applied since 21 November 2012. The guideline has applied since 1 January 2014.   background   Collecting SHS helps monitor financial stability and financial integration in the euro area, and also in the EU as a whole, as comparable indicators are often available for all EU countries.  For more information, see:    Securities holdings statistics  (  European Central Bank  ).   key terms    Sectoral data reporting agents:  resident monetary financial institutions, investment funds, financial vehicle corporations, insurance corporations and custodians (which are entities which undertake the safekeeping and administration of financial instruments for the account of clients).   Group data reporting agents:  where they have been identified by the ECB’s Governing Council as part of the actual reporting population, and notified of their reporting obligations (by letter, see Guideline, Annex II).   heads of banking groups; and   institutions or financial institutions established in participating EU countries and which are not part of a banking group;     International Securities Identification Number (ISIN):  a code assigned to securities, composed of 12 alphanumeric characters, which uniquely identifies a securities issue.   main documents   Regulation (EU) No  1011/2012  of the European Central Bank of 17 October 2012 concerning statistics on holdings of securities (ECB/2012/24) (OJ L 305, 1.11.2012, pp. 6-24)  Successive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1011/2012 have been incorporated into the original document.

summary of   Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 establishing a European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders   summary    what does this regulation do  It establishes  Frontex  , the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union.  Regulation (EU) No  1168/2011  amends the original act to  improve the integrated management  of the EU’s external borders and to  enhance cooperation  between national border guard authorities.  A further amendment, Regulation (EU) No  656/2014  , lays down rules for the surveillance of the EU’s  external sea borders in the context of operational cooperation managed by  Frontex.   key points    Tasks   Frontex’s main tasks are:   planning and coordinating  joint operations  and rapid border interventions conducted by the Agency using EU countries’ staff and equipment at sea, land and air external borders;   coordinating  joint return operations  of foreign nationals staying illegally in the EU and Schengen countries* and refusing to leave voluntarily;   drawing up  common training standards and tools  for national border guards;   carrying out  risk analyses  (with a view to improving the integrated management of the EU’s external borders);   assisting Schengen countries requiring  increased technical and operational assistance  at external borders (e.g. humanitarian emergencies and rescue at sea or when they face disproportionate pressures on their borders);   developing a  rapid response capability  involving EU Border Guard Teams (see below), as well as a database of available equipment and resources to be deployed in the event of a crisis situation.    Equipment   Frontex can buy/lease its own equipment for border control (cars, vessels, helicopters, etc.) or jointly buy it with EU countries.   Operational plan   An operational plan (drawn up prior to joint operations, rapid border interventions and pilot projects) should include all aspects of the given activity, such as:   tasks and responsibilities,   composition of the teams,   command and control arrangements (e.g. names and ranks of host country’s border guards responsible for cooperating with Frontex and with guest officers from other EU countries working on joint operations),   evaluation and incident reporting, and the applicable jurisdiction (e.g. in the event of sea operations), etc.    EU Border Guard Teams   European Border Guard Teams are deployed in joint operations, rapid border interventions and pilot projects coordinated by Frontex.  They are composed of border guards from the EU countries, experts in different areas of border management, including:   border checks;   land and sea border surveillance;   identification of false documents specialists; and   identification of irregular migrants’ nationalities.    Cooperation   Frontex may cooperate with  Europol  , the  European Asylum Support Office  , the  EU Fundamental Rights Agency  , non-EU country authorities and international organisations such as, the  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  and International Organisation for Migration (IOM).   Eurosur   In 2013, under a separate regulation, the  European Border Surveillance System  (Eurosur) became operational. This information-exchange framework is designed to improve the management of the EU’s external borders. It aims to support EU countries by:   increasing their awareness and reaction capability in combating cross-border crime;   tackling irregular migration; and   preventing the loss of migrants’ lives at sea.   Frontex plays an important role in the compilation and analysis of the ‘European situational picture’, a review of the events that have recently taken place at the borders of certain EU countries and that could help detect changing routes or new methods used by criminal networks.   from when does the regulation apply  It applies from 1 May 2005.   background   Frontex became operational in 2005. It is based in Warsaw, Poland.  In the context of the  European Agenda on Migration  , in December 2015, the  European Commission  issued a  proposal  to create a  European Border and Coast Guard Agency  . This would be built from Frontex and the EU countries’ authorities responsible for border management and would permit a more integrated management of the EU’s external borders.   key term    * Schengen countries  : European countries that have signed an  agreement  to remove border controls and allow free movement of all nationals of the signatory countries, other EU countries and some non-EU countries.  The Schengen countries are as follows: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.   act   Council Regulation (EC) No  2007/2004  of 26 October 2004 establishing a European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (OJ L 349, 25.11.2004, pp. 1-11).

   Road safety: Road Safety Action Programme (2003-2010)     Road safety: Road Safety Action Programme (2003-2010)     Of all modes of transport, transport by road is the most dangerous and the most costly in terms of human lives. For this reason, the Road Safety Action Programme (2003-2010) proposes a series of measures such as stepping up checks on road traffic, deploying new road safety technologies, improving road infrastructure and measures to improve users' behaviour. The ultimate objective is to halve the number of people killed on the roads by 2010.     ACT     Communication from the Commission on the European Road Safety Action Programme. Halving the number of road accident victims in the European Union by 2010: a shared responsibility [       COM(2003) 311      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     1 300 000 accidents a year cause more than 40 000 deaths and 1 700 000 injuries on the roads. The direct and indirect cost has been estimated at 160 billion euros, i.e. 2% of the EU's GNP. Certain groups of the population or categories of road user are particularly vulnerable: young people aged between 15 and 24 (10 000 killed each year), pedestrians (7 000) and cyclists (1 800).     In its       White Paper      on European transport policy, the Commission therefore proposed that the European Union should set itself the target of halving the number of road deaths by 2010. All Member States are faced with the same road safety problems, namely excessive speed, drinking and driving, failure to wear a seat belt, the insufficient protection provided by vehicles, the existence of accident black spots, non-compliance with driving and rest times by commercial drivers and poor visibility. The forthcoming enlargement to include countries with a poor level of road safety is an additional challenge.     The main areas of action outlined in this communication are the following:      Encouraging road users to improve their behaviour       Objective      : to encourage road users to improve their behaviour through stricter compliance with the existing legislation, while harmonising the penalties at EU level, having continuous training for private and commercial drivers, improving police checks and promoting education and road user awareness campaigns.     The failure of drivers to comply with basic road safety legislation is the main cause of serious accidents. The Commission will give priority to education and awareness campaigns aimed at encouraging the use of crash helmets and seat belts and discouraging speeding and alcohol consumption. At the same time, the Commission will take action to amend the Directive on       driving licences      in order to set minimum requirements as regards driving ability.      Main measures      : to encourage the general use of crash helmets by cyclists and by all two-wheel motor vehicle users, continue specific work on young drivers, harmonise the penalties for international hauliers, establish the appropriate classification and labelling of medicines which affect driving ability, and develop best practice guidelines as regards police checks, etc.      Making use of technical progress       Objective      : to make vehicles safer through the harmonisation of passive safety measures (such as mandatory fitting of seat belts) and support for technical progress.     Given that car occupants account for 57% of fatal accident victims, it is necessary that technical progress in vehicle safety is maintained. In view of this, the Commission will continue to support EuroNCAP (the European New Car Assessment Programme) to ensure that new cars are tested in accordance with harmonised testing protocols and to inform and raise awareness among consumers.     The       eSafety      initiative launched in 2002 by the Commission and the motor vehicle industry aims to formulate recommendations and propose a number of actions at EU level. In parallel with this, research activities in the field of road safety must be strengthened, particularly within the context of the       Sixth Research Framework Programme      .      Main measures      : to introduce universal anchorage systems for child restraint devices, improve cars to reduce the severity of accidents involving pedestrians and cyclists, eliminate blind spots in heavy goods vehicles, facilitate the movement of persons with reduced mobility, and improve motorcycle safety, etc.      Encouraging the improvement of road infrastructure       Objective      : to improve road infrastructure by identifying and eliminating accident black spots.     Road infrastructure improvements can contribute towards reducing the frequency and seriousness of road traffic accidents. The early detection of abnormal traffic conditions and the transmission of relevant data to drivers can help to improve road safety. In the context of the development of the 'intelligent road', the entry into service in 2008 of the       Galileo      European satellite positioning system will enable navigation and guidance systems to be developed and make it possible to provide traffic information and to monitor vehicles carrying hazardous goods.     The Commission will submit a proposal for a framework Directive on road infrastructure safety with a view to introducing a system for the harmonised management of accident black spots and road safety audits for roads on the trans-European network (TEN).      Main measures      : to propose a Directive on road infrastructure safety, draw up technical guidelines concerning audit methods, urban safety management and speed-moderation techniques, draw up good practice guidelines for level-crossings, carry out research and demonstration projects on 'intelligent roads', carry out safety impact assessments of new projects, improve safety levels in       tunnels      , etc.      Safe commercial goods and passenger transport       Objective      : to reduce the number of accidents involving heavy goods vehicles and regulate the training of commercial drivers and compliance with driving and rest periods.     In view of the growth of heavy goods traffic, it is necessary to continue to improve the safety of the trans-European road network. Driving heavy goods vehicles is one of the most dangerous professions, and commercial drivers also have a right to a safe working environment in line with the standards on working conditions.      Main measures      : to tighten legislation on commercial drivers' working conditions, install digital tachographs in commercial vehicles, adapt to technical progress the Community legislation concerning the carriage of hazardous goods, make the wearing of seatbelts compulsory in coaches and heavy goods vehicles, improve protection in vehicles regularly used for the carriage of children, etc.      Emergency services and care for road accident victims       Objective      : to examine best practice with regard to post-accident medical care.     The improvement of the response to and care in the event of road accidents could save several thousand lives in the EU. The emergency number 112 allows telephone network operators to provide the emergency services with information to trace emergency calls in the event of an accident. Detailed information on injury severity is also needed for a better understanding of the potential for reducing injuries and for measuring the performance of the emergency medical services.      Main measures      : to carry out demonstration projects involving the whole chain of emergency service provision and study best practices in post-accident care.      Accident data collection, analysis and dissemination       Objective      : to improve the collection and analysis of data on accidents so as to identify the priority fields of action.     Although accidents are random events, it is necessary to understand their causes, circumstances and consequences, so that they can be managed and prevented or mitigated. Thorough independent investigations should be carried out at national level in accordance with a European methodology. The results should be communicated to a committee of independent experts who will be responsible for improving the legislation and adapting the methodology to technical developments.     One example is the       CARE      database, made up of police reports, which should be developed in the interests of achieving greater transparency. The Commission aims to set up a European road safety observatory within the Commission.      Main measures      : to develop and expand the CARE database, assess and improve systems for linking hospital data and national road accident statistics, set up a European road safety observatory, establish a European methodology for independent road accident investigations, set up a group of independent experts, etc.      A European Road Safety Charter      The Commission intends to mobilise all parties concerned: transport companies, vehicle and parts manufacturers, insurance companies, infrastructure operators, local and regional authorities by inviting them to subscribe to a European Road Safety Charter. Each signatory must give specific commitments which will be publicised, and their compliance with them will be monitored.     RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament "Information and Communications Technologies for Safe and Intelligent Vehicles" [         COM(2003) 542        final - Not published in the Official Journal].

As a result of this Decision, short-range automotive radars capable of detecting the risk of collision and of automatically engaging the braking system should become available in the second half of 2005. A special frequency band covering the territory of the EU will now be available for short-range radars.     Other useful applications are currently being developed, such as high-capacity wireless data transmission systems and the location of victims in emergency situations.     Last updated: 27.01.2005  
summary of   Recommendation 2013/396/EU on common principles for injunctive and compensatory collective redress mechanisms in EU countries   what is the aim of this recommendation   It sets out a series of common non-binding principles for national collective redress  *  mechanisms.   The aim is to enable citizens and companies to enforce their rights granted to them under European Union (EU) law where these have been infringed.   These redress mechanisms should be available in different areas where EU law grants rights to citizens and companies, such as in consumer protection, competition, environmental protection and financial services.   key points   The main principles are laid down in a  European Commission  recommendation, published in parallel with a  communication  which suggests that all EU countries introduce collective redress mechanisms based on agreed principles. These principles are as follows:   Claimants should be able to seek court orders to cease violations of their rights granted by EU law (‘injunctive relief’) and to claim damages for harm caused by such violations (‘compensatory relief’) in a case where a large number of persons are harmed by the same illegal practice.   Collective redress procedures must be fair, equitable, timely and not prohibitively expensive.   Collective redress systems should be based on the ‘opt-in’ principle. Under this principle, potential claimants who have not directly expressed their consent are not members of the group and therefore, may not benefit directly from a favourable outcome of the collective redress proceedings.   There should be procedural safeguards to avoid abuse of collective redress systems such as:   a ban on punitive (i.e. excessively high) damages and interest;   entities representing claimants should not be profit-making;   a ban on the payment of contingency fees to lawyers.     The losing party is required to pay the winning party’s legal costs.   The judge has a key role in the collective litigation  *  to effectively manage the case and must be vigilant against any possible abuses.   Claimants should be able to settle the case by means of collective consensual dispute resolution mechanisms (i.e. procedures whereby parties reach consensus on a solution).   when does the recommendation apply  EU countries were invited to apply these principles no later than 26 July 2015.   background   Collective redress facilitates access to justice by those whose rights have been violated by one and the same entity. It allows them to enforce their rights collectively where they would not have done on an individual basis because of the cost or the time that it entails.  The EU framework for collective redress complements the existing mechanisms at EU level namely:   the  European Small Claims Procedure  ,   the  directive on alternative dispute resolution  ,   the  directive on certain aspects of mediation in civil and commercial matters  , or   the  directive on actions for damages under national law for infringements of competition law  .   For more information, see:    Judicial redress – collective redress  on the European Commission’s website.   * key terms     Collective redress:  a mechanism that results in the ending or preventing of an unlawful business practice that affects a group of claimants or the compensation for the harm caused by these practices.     Group/ collective litigation:  a lawsuit brought by a group of claimants.
summary of   Directive 2009/104/EC — minimum safety and health requirements for the use of work equipment by workers at work   what is the aim of this directive   It lays down minimum health and safety requirements for the use of  work equipment in the workplace  .   It is the second individual directive within the meaning of Directive  89/391/EEC  which introduces general rules to encourage improvements in the health and safety of workers at work.   It  codifies  and repeals Directive  89/655/EEC  which had been substantially amended several times.   key points   Employers must take every measure to ensure the safety of the work equipment made available to workers.  In selecting the work equipment, employers must pay attention to the specific working conditions which exist at the workplace with a view to the safety and health of workers. Where risks cannot be fully eliminated during the operation of the work equipment, employers must take appropriate measures to minimise them. Where EU legislation governing work equipment exists, employers must ensure that the equipment meets its requirements or the requirements laid down in Annex I of this directive.  Employers are responsible for ensuring work equipment is:    maintained  regularly to remain compliant with legal requirements;    installed correctly  and is  operating properly  by ensuring the inspection/testing of the work equipment by suitably qualified persons. Results of inspections must be  recorded and kept  .   Where work equipment is likely to involve a specific risk to worker health and safety, employers must ensure access to it is restricted only to those given the task of using it. Employers must also ensure that only specially designated workers carry out repair, modification, maintenance or servicing work.  Employers must also take fully into account  ergonomic principles  and  occupational health aspects  with respect to workers while using work equipment.  Employers must provide workers with  adequate and clear information  (where appropriate in written form) on the work equipment, concerning:   the conditions of use,   foreseeable abnormal situations,   conclusions drawn from experience.   Employers must ensure that workers are  appropriately trained  , especially with regard to specific-risk equipment, and are made aware of any risks which the use of equipment may entail.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 23 October 2009. The Directive 2009/104/EU  codifies  and replaces Directive 89/655/EEC and its subsequent amendments. The original Directive 89/655/EEC had to become law in the EU countries by 1992.   background   For more information, see:    Health and safety at work  (  European Commission  )    Directive 2009/104/EC – use of work equipment  (  European Agency for Health and Safety at Work  ).
summary of   Regulation (EU) No 1144/2014 — information and promotion measures concerning agricultural products   what is the aim of the regulation  It lays down the conditions under which the EU budget will finance the promotion of agricultural products and certain other food products within the EU and internationally.   key points   Recognising that one of the European Union’s great strengths is the quality and diversity of its agri-food products, this law aims to open up new markets and diversify trading partners by increasing funding for promotional activities. It specifically focuses on markets in non-EU countries with the highest growth potential. The measures seek to increase awareness and recognition of:   the high quality of EU products in terms of taste, diversity and traditions;   the EU’s high production standards, including  food safety  ,  traceability  ,  nutritional and health aspects  ,  animal welfare  , respect for the environment and sustainability;   the  EU’s quality schemes  , the authenticity of protected designations of origin, protected geographical indications and traditional specialities.   The measures also contain provisions to restore normal market conditions in the event of market disturbance, loss of consumer confidence or other problems.  Eligible products under this regulation are listed in  Annex I of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union  (excluding tobacco) supplemented by Annex I of this regulation to include, among others, beer, confectionery, bread, cakes and pasta.  The activities covered consist of public relations and information campaigns, and may also take the form of participation in national and international events, fairs and exhibitions. Programmes can be proposed by trade organisations, producer groups or established agri-food sector bodies representing the products concerned.  The European Commission is responsible for formulating an annual budgeted work programme and setting priorities and objectives, and can propose its own promotional initiatives.  Under the regulation, national co-funding will disappear, with EU co-financing rates raised to 70 % for simple programmes presented by an organisation from a single EU country, 80 % for multi-EU country programmes and those targeting non-EU countries and 85 % for crisis measures. An additional 5 % allocation is available for beneficiaries from EU countries that are receiving special financial assistance (for example, countries with serious difficulties as regards their balance of payments).   from when does this regulation apply  I has applied since 1 December 2015.   background   For more information, see:    Promotion of EU farm products  (  European Commission  )  .
summary of   Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste   what is the aim of the directive  Directive 94/62/EC sets out the  EU  ’s rules on managing packaging and packaging waste.  Directive 94/62/EC aims at:   harmonising national measures concerning the management of packaging and packaging waste; and    improving the quality of the  environment  by preventing and reducing the impact of packaging and packaging waste on the environment.   Directive (EU)  2018/852  is the last amendment of Directive 94/62/EC and contains updated measures designed to:   prevent the production of packaging waste, and    promote the reuse, recycling and other forms of recovering of packaging waste, instead of its final disposal, thus contributing to the transition towards a circular economy  *  .   key points    Scope   The directive covers all packaging placed on the European market and all packaging waste, whether it is used or released at industrial, commercial, office, shop, service, household or any other level, regardless of the material used.   Measures   The directive as amended requires EU countries to take measures, such as national programmes, incentives through extended producer responsibility schemes and other economic instruments, to prevent the generation of packaging waste and to minimise the environmental impact of packaging.  EU countries should encourage the increase in the share of reusable packaging  *  put on the market and of systems to reuse packaging in an environmentally sound manner without compromising  food safety  or the safety of consumers. This may include:   deposit-return schemes   targets   economic incentives   minimum percentages of reusable packaging placed on the market for each type of packaging, etc.   EU countries must also take the necessary measures to meet recycling targets which vary depending on a packaging material. For this purpose, they must apply the new calculation rules for reporting on the new recycling targets to be achieved by 2025 and 2030.   Targets   By 31 December 2025, at least 65% by weight of all packaging waste must be recycled. The recycling targets per material are:   50% of plastic   25% of wood   70% of ferrous metals   50% of aluminium   70% of glass, and   75% of paper and cardboard.   By 31 December 2030, at least 70% by weight of all packaging waste must be recycled. This includes:   55% of plastic   30% of wood   80% of ferrous metals   60% of aluminium   75% of glass and   85% of paper and cardboard.    Essential requirements   EU countries must ensure that the packaging placed on the market meets the essential requirements contained in Annex II of the directive:   to limit the weight and volume of packaging to a minimum adequate amount in order to still meet the required level of safety, hygiene and acceptability for the packed product and for the consumers;   to minimise the content of hazardous substances and materials in the packaging material and its components;   to design reusable or recoverable packaging, which may include design for material or organic recycling as well as design for energy recovery.   The amended directive clarified the difference between packaging recoverable in the form of composting and biodegradable packaging waste and specified that oxo-degradable plastic packaging (plastic packaging with additives causing it to break down into microscopic particles and contributing to the presence of microplastics in the environment)is not considered as biodegradable packaging.  The  European Commission  is currently examining how to reinforce the essential requirements with the view to improving packaging design for reuse and promoting high-quality recycling, as well as strengthening the enforcement of the essential requirements.   Packaging recovery systems   EU countries should ensure that systems are set up to provide for the return and/or collection of used packaging and/or packaging waste, as well as the reuse or recovery including recycling of the packaging and/or packaging waste collected.   Producer responsibility    By end of 2024, EU countries should ensure that producer responsibility schemes  *  are established for all packaging. Producer responsibility schemes provide for the financing or financing and organisation of the return and/or collection of used packaging and/or packaging waste and its channelling to the most appropriate waste management option, as well as for reuse or recycling of the collected packaging and packaging waste.   These schemes will need to comply with minimum requirements established under Waste Framework Directive  2008/98/EC  (see  summary  ). The schemes should help incentivise packaging that is designed, produced and commercialised in a way that promotes packaging reuse or high quality recycling and minimise the impact of packaging and packaging waste on the environment.    Information systems and reporting    An  implementing act  , Decision  2005/270/EC  sets out the formats, as well as the rules for the calculation, verification and reporting of data that must be provided by EU countries to the Commission each year to monitor the implementation of Directive 94/62/EC.   Decision (EU)  2019/665  amends Decision 2005/270/EC introducing new rules to bring it into line with the new rules in Directive 94/62/EC regarding the calculation of the attainment of the recycling targets relating to:   the possibility of taking into account — up to maximum 5% of the recycling target — reusable sales packaging (Article 5(2)),   the possibility of taking into account wooden packaging repaired for reuse (in Article 5(3)),   the calculation of the amount of metals in packaging waste separated from incineration bottom ash after incinerated (Article 6a),   composite packaging, which should no longer be reported per predominant material, but rather per material contained in the packaging, with a possible derogations for materials that constitute less than 5% of the total mass of the packaging unit.      The new calculation rules aim at making sure that only waste that enters a recycling operation or waste that has achieved end of waste status should be used for the calculation of the recycling target and, as a general rule, the measurement of waste should be at the input to the recycling operation.   the decision provides for an enhanced system of quality control on reported data (data directly from economic operators, use of electronic registries), thus ensuring a better traceability of reported data, including on waste exported for recycling to non-EU third countries.   Decision (EU) 2019/665 also introduces changes to the formats for reporting data pursuant to Article 12 of Directive 94/62/EC. The formats should take into account the information on reusable packaging placed on the market for the first time and on the number of rotations that packaging performs per year — essential to determining the share of reusable packaging compared to single use packaging. As reusable sales packaging may be taken into account in the context of the recycling targets, a distinction must be made between reusable sales packaging and other reusable packaging.   from when does the directives apply   Directive 94/62/EC has applied since 31 December 1994 and had to become law in the EU countries by 30 June 1996.   Amending Directive (EU) 2018/852 has applied since 4 July 2018 and had to become law in the EU countries by 5 July 2020.   background   For more information, see:    Packaging and packaging waste  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Circular economy:  a circular economy minimises resource input, waste, emissions and energy leakage. It can be achieved through long-lasting design, maintenance, repair, reuse and recycling. It contrasts to a linear economy which extracts resources, uses them, then throws them away.   Reusable packaging:  packaging which has been conceived, designed and marketed to carry out multiple trips in its lifetime by being refilled or reused for the same purpose for which it was conceived.   Extended Producer responsibility schemes:  systems set up to ensure that producers bear the financial or financial and organisational responsibility for the management of waste stage of a product’s life cycle. By modulating the fees payable by producers for placing packaging on the market, EPR schemes allow producers and EU countries to encourage the design of products and their components which are more respective of the environment.
   Traffic management: air traffic controller licences     Traffic management: air traffic controller licences     European airspace remains one of the world's most congested traffic areas. Fragmentation of the air management system into national "islands" of rules, procedures, markets and performance levels is now the main impediment to making progress in this industry. It is therefore important that the entrance conditions and conditions of practice relating to the profession of air traffic controller be harmonised. The single European sky package is designed to remedy this fragmentation through a number of initiatives, one of which is the Community air traffic controller licence, by which Community rules can be introduced which will ensure higher levels of safety.     ACT     Directive       2006/23/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on a Community air traffic controller licence.     SUMMARY     This Directive applies to applicants for a student air traffic controller licence and to air traffic controllers employed by air navigation service providers operating mainly in the field of general air traffic.     Member States must designate a body or bodies as their national supervisory authority to take on the tasks assigned to such authorities under the new rules. Member States must ensure that national supervisory authorities exercise their powers impartially and transparently.     The Directive will:      lay down rules on all the elements of the licensing chain;       make the institutional framework laid down in the Single European Sky legislation applicable to training; training is seen as a service similar to air navigation services, including the possibility of inspections and surveys;       specify the conditions for obtaining and maintaining a licence;       harmonise competencies by imposing a structure of ratings and endorsements which specify the type of service that the air traffic controller is competent to deliver;       give further guarantees of a high level of competence, particularly through the auditing requirement and the system for approving examiners.      The provision of air navigation services requires highly skilled personnel. For air traffic control the appropriate means is the Community licence, to be seen as a kind of diploma. In this context, air traffic controller licences will be issued to applicants who:      hold at least a secondary education diploma (or equivalent degree) or a diploma granting access to university;       have successfully completed an approved initial training course relevant to the rating, including practical training and simulation;       hold a valid medical certificate; medical certificates must be issued in accordance with the international medical requirements;       have demonstrated an adequate level of linguistic ability; Member States must ensure that air traffic controllers can demonstrate the ability to operate in English and possibly the local language.      At the same time, applicants must:      be at least 18 years old;       hold a student licence;       hold a valid medical certificate;       have demonstrated an adequate level of linguistic ability in accordance with the set requirements.      Each Member State must recognise the licence and its associated ratings and endorsements issued by the national supervisory authority of another Member State. This should lead to the recognition of licences throughout the Community, thereby increasing both freedom of movement and the availability of air traffic controllers.     This directive is repealed by Regulation (EC) No       1108/2009      from December 2012.      Background      The objective of this Directive is to raise       safety standards      and improve the operation of the Community air traffic control system through the issuance of a Community air traffic controller licence.     Air traffic controllers are a key link in the safety chain. The licence is thus part of a wider Community safety policy enshrined in the package. It should provide the opportunity to revise or reinforce safety aspects of air traffic management and introduce high standards for the training system.     The       International Civil Aviation Organisation      (ICAO) has adopted provisions on air traffic controller licensing, including linguistic requirements. In addition, the European Organisation for the       Safety of Air Navigation      (Eurocontrol) has adopted Eurocontrol Safety Regulatory Requirements relating to training and licensing. However, despite these many international regulations, licensing remains highly fragmented in the European Union Member States.

   Protection against subsidies and unfair pricing practices which cause injury in the air transport sector     Protection against subsidies and unfair pricing practices which cause injury in the air transport sector     This regulation sets out the procedure for protecting against pricing practices of and subsidies to non-European Union (EU) air carriers which cause injury to the EU industry.     ACT     Regulation (EC) No       868/2004      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 concerning protection against subsidisation and unfair pricing practices causing injury to Community air carriers in the supply of air services from countries not members of the European Community [       See amending act(s)      ].     SUMMARY     This regulation was approved following the air transport crisis at the end of 2001 that led some governments outside the European Union (EU) to subsidise their national airlines, while the EU industry is subject to strict rules on government aid.     The regulation allows       redressive measures      to be imposed when non-EU air carriers are subsidised directly or indirectly or when they carry out unfair pricing practices on one or more routes to or from the EU, thereby causing injury to the EU industry. These measures preferably take the form of       duties      and are imposed by regulation and enforced by the EU countries themselves.     According to the regulation, a       subsidy      exists when a government, regional body or other public organisation makes a financial contribution that confers a benefit. It may take the form of:      grants, loans or equity infusion, potential direct transfer of funds or the assumption of liabilities;       revenue that is otherwise due but which is foregone or not collected;       the supply of goods or services other than general infrastructure, or their purchase by a public body;       payments by a public body to a funding mechanism or the entrusting to a private body of one of the functions described above.      To be subject to redressive measures, the subsidies must be limited to an industry or group of enterprises or industries within the jurisdiction of the granting authority.     An       unfair pricing practice      exists where non-EU air carriers benefit from a non-commercial advantage and charge fares that are sufficiently low to cause injury to competing EU air carriers. The regulation lays down elements to take into account when fares are compared.     Before proceedings are initiated, it must be shown, by the existing facts that       injury      is being caused. The determination of injury must be based on positive evidence and involves an examination of the level of fares charged, their effect on EU fares and the impact of the air services concerned on the EU industry.     An       investigation      is initiated when a written complaint is lodged by the EU industry or on the Commission's own initiative. Where sufficient evidence exists, the proceeding is initiated within 45 days of the lodging of the complaint, but this period may be extended by up to 30 days if there is a bilateral agreement. Notice of the initiation of the procedure must be published in the Official Journal and include the details specified in the regulation. The Commission must notify interested parties. The Commission has 45 days within which to inform the complainant if insufficient evidence is presented.     This investigation should be       concluded      within nine months of proceedings being initiated. An extension may be allowed if a satisfactory resolution of the complaint appears imminent or if additional time is needed in order to achieve a resolution that is in the EU interest. Interested parties may be granted a hearing. However, if they refuse access to or fail to provide necessary information within the appropriate time limits, the final findings may be made on the basis of facts available.     Four possible scenarios may be the result of an investigation:       provisional measures        : these may be imposed for a maximum period of six months if it is determined that injury is being caused and that the EU interest calls for intervention to prevent further such injury;        termination of the proceedings without measures being imposed        : this happens when the complaint is withdrawn or a satisfactory remedy is obtained;        definitive measures        : these are imposed when it is established that unfair pricing practices or subsidies which cause injury exist. The level of measures imposed must not exceed the level of the subsidies or the difference between the fares charged by the two air carriers concerned (EU and non-EU);        undertakings        : an investigation may be terminated without measures being imposed if the public authorities or non-EU air carrier concerned undertake to eliminate the subsidies and revise its prices in order to prevent further injury. In the event of an undertaking being breached, a definitive measure will be imposed.      If the circumstances warrant, the Commission may review the imposition of the measures in their initial form with a view to repealing, modifying or maintaining them.

   Online access to Europe’s cultural heritage     Online access to Europe’s cultural heritage     This Communication presents the progress made in developing       Europeana      , the European digital library, which will provide the public with a single access point to Europe’s cultural heritage. The main issues addressed concern digitisation, online accessibility and digital preservation of cultural material.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 11 August 2008 – Europe’s cultural heritage at the click of a mouse: Progress on the digitisation and online accessibility of cultural material and digital preservation across the EU [       COM(2008) 513      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This Communication sets out the progress achieved thus far and the steps that still need to be taken in order to develop       Europeana      , the European       digital library      . Particular emphasis is on the actions carried out by Member States to implement the Commission Recommendation       2006/585/EC      of 24 August 2006 on the digitisation and online accessibility of cultural material and digital preservation, which was endorsed in the Council Conclusions of 20 November 2008.      Europeana      will be a common multilingual point of access to digitised European material. In 2007, its development received new impetus, especially through the creation of the European Digital Library Foundation that brings together different cultural sectors. The demo site of       Europeana      was published in February 2008 with the aim that the prototype will be launched in November of the same year. This prototype is to be developed into a fully operational service within the following two years.     The issues yet to be addressed in the development of       Europeana      include the:      incorporation of in-copyright material;       provision of multilingual search and retrieval functions;       integration of collaborative tools;       promotion of         Europeana        to the wider public.      On the basis of the above-mentioned Recommendation, Member States have progressed on the following:       digitisation        – Most Member States have established overviews of digitisation activities, as well as strategies and plans for digitisation. However, the overviews are not used in any systematic manner and the strategies and plans do not provide quantitative targets. Further efforts are needed in these areas, as well as in financial planning. While some of the Member States have provided substantial amounts of resources to digitisation, additional funding is needed. This could be achieved through public-private partnerships or through private sponsoring. It is also essential that the output of digitisation continues to rise. To this end, many Member States have established digitisation centres;        online accessibility        – Many of the Member States have either established or are establishing national portals, which may act as aggregators for         Europeana        . Most are also working on the standards that are essential for interoperability in Europe. In order to make the availability of in-copyright material possible, some Member States have begun to involve private content holders in their work. With regard to orphan works though, progress seems to be limited. In this regard, some Member States expressed their wish for a European level solution. Similarly, little progress has been made in connection with clearing rights for digitising and making available online works that are out of print or distribution, or to barriers to the use of public domain works. More attention should be given in particular to the latter issue, as it is imperative to continue providing access to such works;        digital preservation        – Most Member States have begun to formulate digital preservation strategies and some have already established specific preservation plans; yet, the follow-up and financial backing to these remain limited. Multiple copying for preservation purposes is already allowed in most of the Member States, and even the remaining Member States are contemplating the necessary legislative actions. Similarly, the legal deposit legislation is already updated in most Member States, but the differences in materials covered and the deposit criteria are substantial. Many of the Member States have also implemented legislation relating to web harvesting by specified institutions (usually the national library). Otherwise, access to web-harvested material remains restricted due to intellectual property and privacy rights.      Even though Member States have progressed considerably in making cultural information available online, further action needs to be taken in particular with regard to:      funding of and quantitative targets for digitisation;       support for         Europeana        ;       legislative actions and other measures to enable the digitisation and accessibility of orphan works and works that are out of print or distribution;       financial and organisational measures relating to digital preservation.      The High Level Expert Group on Digital Libraries, set up in 2006, has given practical assistance to Member States in implementing the above Recommendation. The Group’s work focuses in particular on public-private partnerships, scientific information and copyright issues.     In order to develop the services provided by       Europeana      , advancements in technical issues are needed, especially to achieve cheaper and better quality digitisation and preservation techniques. The Commission has supported this progress through the       Framework Programmes for Research and Development      and the        eContentplus       programme. It has asserted its commitment to continue providing support through policy initiatives and funding programmes for the development of       Europeana      and other projects that improve the accessibility and preservation of digital cultural material.     RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - "Europeana: next steps" [         COM(2009) 440 final        – Not published in the Official Journal.      This Communication sets out the challenges to come concerning the implementation of Europeana.     Europeana’s results are positive, in that it gives access to more than 4.6 million digitised books, newspapers, film clips, maps, photographs and documents and receives contributions from more than 1,000 cultural institutions.     However, the Communication notes several problems connected with:      an imbalance between Member States in terms of the provision of cultural material. France has contributed 47% of the digitised objects, while other Member States such as Poland and Hungary have contributed mainly books;       copyright, in that recent works enjoy protection which limits access to them, unlike works from before 1900. It is important to establish collaboration with rightholders in order to improve access to protected works. Another challenge lies in the legal consequences of digitisation;       the financing and governance of Europeana.      Further efforts are therefore necessary in order to ensure that citizens can enjoy the services of Europeana fully.      Council conclusions of 20 November 2008 on the European digital library         Europeana        [Official Journal C 319 of 13.12.2008].      In its conclusions the Council of the European Union expressed satisfaction with the gradual establishment of the       Europeana      European library and the commitment of Member States to this project. In order for the project to be a success, the Council invites Member States to:      continue their strategy of implementation of their national objectives;       promote synergies between them in the process of digitisation and increasing online accessibility of cultural material;       incorporate digital cultural material in         Europeana        ;       facilitate digitisation and online access to orphan works.      The European Commission is invited to encourage the development of       Europeana      and to promote it in Europe and the world, as well as to encourage the establishment of public-private partnerships to develop it.

act   Council Directive  98/24/EC  of 7 April 1998 on the protection of the health and safety of workers from the risks related to chemical agents at work (fourteenth individual directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive  89/391/EEC  ).   summary    SCOPE   Directive  98/24/EC  applies to workers exposed to hazardous chemicals when its provisions are more favourable than those of Directive  2004/37/EC  on the protection of workers from risks from carcinogens.  Framework Directive  89/391/EEC  , laying down minimum requirements for the protection of workers from health and safety risks from chemicals, applies in full, without prejudice to provisions that are more stringent or specific in this directive.  Following approval of Regulation (EC) No  1272/2008  on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, it was necessary to align the 1998 directive, and four others, with those new provisions. The changes were incorporated in Directive  2014/27/EU  . This identifies hazardous chemicals and informs users of the related risks through  standard symbols and wording on packaging labels and safety data sheets  .   EMPLOYERS’ OBLIGATIONS    Assessing risk   Employers must determine whether any hazardous chemicals are present and, if so, assess health and safety risks they might pose. This assessment must be kept up to date.   Preventing risks   Employers must take the necessary preventive measures to eliminate or reduce risks to the minimum. They should provide suitable equipment and reduce the duration of any exposure and safe handling, storage and transport of hazardous chemicals. Where possible, chemicals or processes must be replaced with less dangerous ones.  The legislation provides for indicative occupational exposure limit values to be established.   Dealing with accidents, incidents and emergencies   Employers must draw up action plans so that appropriate action, including informing those concerned, is taken when an accident occurs. These must be accompanied by regular safety drills and first-aid facilities.   Informing and training workers   Employers must provide workers with results of risk assessments, information on hazardous chemical substances on the premises and the relevant occupational exposure limit values. They must also supply training and details on appropriate precautions to be taken.   MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS    Bans   The directive bans the production, manufacture or use of certain chemicals. These are set out in Annex III. Exemptions are allowed under certain circumstances like scientific research and testing. In such cases, employers must provide authorities with information such as the quantities to be used and number of workers likely to be involved.   Health monitoring   EU countries must arrange appropriate health monitoring for workers whose health may be at risk. Individual health and exposure records are required.   Final provisions   EU countries report to the Commission every 5 years on the implementation of the various measures.

summary of   Regulation (EEC) No 315/93 — EU procedures for contaminants in food   summary    what does this regulation do  It seeks to protect public health by prohibiting the marketing of foods containing an unacceptable amount of residual substances known as ‘contaminants’.   key points    Contaminants are present in food as a result of treatment after production or through environmental contamination.   The EU regulates the toxicologically acceptable levels of contaminants and keeps them at the lowest possible levels.   Contaminants which are the subject of more specific rules, or to extraneous matter, such as insect fragments, animal hair, etc. are not covered by this regulation.   An EU country may take restrictive measures by reference to this regulation if it suspects that the presence of a contaminant poses a hazard to public health. If so, it must immediately inform the other EU countries and the  European Commission  and give reasons for its decision. The Commission must examine the reasons given by the EU country as soon as possible and take appropriate measures after having consulted the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (  now  the  Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed  ). This Committee assists the Commission on all matters which concern contaminants, including the establishment of authorised maximum tolerances.   The regulation requires maximum levels to be set for certain contaminants in order to protect public health.   EU countries must not prohibit trade in foods that comply with this regulation.   Commission Regulation (EC) No  1881/2006  sets maximum levels for certain contaminants in food including nitrate, lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic, melamine, etc.   from when does the regulation apply  It applies since 1 March 1993.   background   For more information, see also  ‘Contaminants’  on the European Commission's website   act   Council Regulation (EEC) No  315/93  of 8 February 1993 laying down Community procedures for contaminants in food (OJ L 37, 13.2.1993, pp. 1-3)  Successive amendments and corrections to Regulation (EEC) No 315/93 have been incorporated into the original text.

   Scheme of generalised tariff preferences from 2002 to 2005     Scheme of generalised tariff preferences from 2002 to 2005     The European Union is putting in place the scheme of generalised tariff preferences for the period from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2005. The system simplifies and harmonises the procedures of the various existing arrangements in order to improve the access of developing countries to the Community market while ensuring the promotion of fundamental social standards and environmental standards.     ACT     Council Regulation (EC) No       2501/2001      applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences for the period from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2004 [Official Journal L 346 of 31.12.2001] [       See amending acts      ]     SUMMARY     This Regulation extends the Community's scheme of generalised preferences for developing countries to 31 December 2005.     It provides for:      general arrangements;       special incentive arrangements for the protection of labour rights;       special incentive arrangements for the protection of the environment;       special arrangements for least-developed countries;       special arrangements to combat drug production and trafficking.       General arrangements      According to the Regulation, products considered to be non-sensitive products, imported into the Community from beneficiary developing countries, are exempt from customs duties. Goods from the textile and clothing sector only receive a 20% reduction in Common Customs Tariff (CCT) duties. Products classified as sensitive benefit from a CCT duty reduction of 3.5 percentage points.     These tariff preferences apply to imports of products from beneficiary developing countries. Regional cumulation of origin is envisaged in order to encourage regional groupings. The beneficiary countries of the generalised system of preferences (GSP) are listed in Annex I to the Regulation.     The Regulation stipulates that countries no longer requiring preferential treatment will be removed from the list of countries benefiting from the GSP. This concerns the countries that, during three consecutive years, have been classified by the World Bank as high-income countries and have achieved a specific level of industrial development calculated according to a formula set out in the Regulation (development index). If, during an equivalent period, these criteria have not been met by the excluded country, it will again be included in the list of countries benefiting from the GSP.     By virtue of the principle of graduation, the tariff preferences set out in the Regulation are removed in respect of beneficiary countries and products belonging to a given sector if, during three consecutive years, the country concerned meets either of the following criteria:      its development index reaches a specific level set out in the Regulation and Community imports from that country of all products of the sector concerned exceed 25% of Community imports of the same products from all beneficiary countries;       its development index reaches a specific level set out in the Regulation, the specialisation index of the sector concerned is higher than the threshold corresponding to that country's development index, and Community imports from that country of all products of the sector concerned exceed 2% of Community imports of the same products from all beneficiary countries.      The tariff preferences are re-established if, during three consecutive years, the sector has not met either of the criteria.      Special incentive arrangements      The GSP enables beneficiary countries to be covered by incentive arrangements allowing them to benefit from an additional reduction in customs duties of 5 percentage points for exports to the Community. Thus, the total reduction comes to 8.5 percentage points.     The       special incentive arrangements for the protection of labour rights      may be granted to countries whose national legislation incorporates the rules adopted in the conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO):      n° 29 and n° 105 on the abolition of forced labour;       n° 87 and n° 98 on the freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining;       n° 100 and n° 111 on non-discrimination in respect of employment and occupation;       and n° 138 and n° 182 on the abolition of child labour.      These arrangements may also be granted to countries whose legislation has incorporated the essential elements of these rules, and which have clearly begun a clear and definite process of applying them. In such cases, the arrangements may be granted for a limited period of time. The country must demonstrate that it has made progress in applying the rules for renewal of the arrangements.     The       special incentive arrangements for the protection of the environment      benefit imports of products of the tropical forest originating in a country which effectively applies national legislation incorporating the substance of internationally acknowledged standards and guidelines concerning sustainable management of tropical forests (mainly those of the International Tropical Timber Organisation).     Countries wishing to benefit from these arrangements must submit their requests to the Commission, which examines them and verifies that they are effectively applying the social and environmental standards required before taking its decision.      Special arrangements for least developed countries      This Regulation incorporates the 'Everything But Arms' initiative adopted by Regulation (EC) No       416/2001      of 28 February 2001. In fact, the Community extends duty-free access without any quantitative restrictions to products originating in the least developed countries, with the exception of arms and ammunition. However, free access arrangements will be gradually introduced for bananas from 2002 and for rice and sugar between 2006 and 2009. In the meantime, a global tariff quota at zero duty is opened for these products (Regulation (EC) No       1381/2002      of 29 July 2002 and Regulation (EC) No       1401/2002      of 31 July 2002).      Special arrangements to combat drug production and trafficking      Specific arrangements entailing the complete suspension of CCT duties applicable to industrial and agricultural products are established for Andean Pact countries, Central America and Pakistan. These arrangements aim to promote political, economic and social stability in these countries threatened by drug production and trafficking.     The Commission is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the effects of these arrangements on the beneficiary countries and assessing their social development and their environmental policy.      Temporary withdrawal      Tariff preferences may be temporarily withdrawn in respect of all or certain products originating in a beneficiary country under certain circumstances:      practice of any form of slavery or forced labour;       serious and systematic violation of fundamental social rights and principles of labour law (freedom of association, collective bargaining, child labour, etc.);       export of goods made by prison labour;       shortcomings in customs controls on export or transit of drugs;       fraud, irregularities or systematic failure to comply with the rules of origin;       unfair trading practices;       infringement of the objectives of international conventions concerning the conservation and management of fishery resources.      The Regulation sets out the general substance of the administrative cooperation required on the part of beneficiary countries, particularly with regard to monitoring the origin of goods. It lays down the procedure governing the investigation carried out by the Commission before deciding whether or not to withdraw preferences temporarily together with the arrangements for the participation of the country concerned in this investigation.      Safeguard provisions      The Regulation also includes a safeguard clause enabling the Commission to suspend tariff preferences and reintroduce CCT duties where a product originating in a beneficiary country is imported on terms which cause, or threaten to cause, serious difficulties to a Community producer of like or directly competing products. Following an investigation, the Commission takes its decision within 30 days of consulting the Generalised Preferences Committee. Where immediate action is required, the Commission may take any preventive measure which is necessary.

   Financial transaction tax     Financial transaction tax     In the context of the economic and financial crisis, it is more and more commonly accepted that the financial sector should make a fairer contribution, this sector having been under-taxed to date given the exemption from VAT of most financial services. This Proposal for a Directive is therefore aimed at developing a common tax reserved for financial transactions, the main objectives of which are to ensure that financial institutions make a fair contribution to covering the costs of the crisis and to avoid fragmentation in the internal market for financial transactions.     PROPOSAL     Proposal for a Council Directive of 28 September 2011 on a common system of financial transaction tax and amending Directive 2008/7/EC [       COM(2011) 594      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This Proposal is aimed at establishing a common system of financial transaction tax       *      (FTT).     It concerns       all financial transactions      , namely the purchase and sale of a financial instrument, such as company shares, bonds, money-market instruments, units of undertakings for collective investment, structured products and derivatives and the conclusion or modification of derivatives agreements, on condition that at least one party to the transaction is established in a Member State and that a financial institution (such as investment firms, organised markets, credit institutions, insurance and reinsurance undertakings, collective investment undertakings and their managers, pension funds and their managers, and certain other undertakings where transactions constitute a significant part of their activity) established in a Member State is party to the transaction, acting either for its own account or for the account of another person, or is acting in the name of a party to the transaction.     In general, a financial institution shall be deemed to be established in the Member State of authorisation in order to act as such but it should be noted that, under certain conditions, a financial institution not established in a Member State, for example where it is a party to a financial transaction with a party established in the territory of a Member State, shall also be deemed to be established in the territory of a Member State (of the latter mentioned in this case).     The following entities shall be excluded from the scope of the Directive:      the European Financial Stability Facility;       any international financial institution established by two or more Member States, which has the purpose to mobilise funding and provide financial assistance to the benefit of its members that are experiencing or threatened by severe financing problems;       Central Counter Parties, i.e. legal entities that interpose themselves between the counterparties to a financial transaction;       national or international Central Securities Depositories.      The following transactions shall be excluded from the scope of the Directive:      primary market transactions in principle as regards the issue of company shares or bonds;       under certain conditions, transactions with the European Union, the         European Atomic Energy Community        , the         European Central Bank        , the         European Investment Bank        , bodies set up by the European Union or the European Atomic Energy Community and other international organisations and bodies;       transactions with the central banks of Member States.       Chargeability, taxable amount and rates of FTT      The FTT shall become chargeable from the moment the transaction occurs. Subsequent cancellation or rectification of a financial transaction shall have no effect on chargeability, except for cases of errors.     In the case of       transactions other      than those concerning derivatives agreements, the taxable amount of the FTT shall be, in principle, everything which constitutes consideration paid or owed, in return for the transfer, from the counterparty or a third party.     In the case of transactions concerning       derivatives agreements      , the taxable amount of the FTT shall be the notional amount (i.e. the underlying nominal or face amount that is used to calculate payments made on a given derivatives agreement) of the derivatives agreement at the time of the financial transaction.     Where appropriate, the       exchange rate applicable      shall be the latest selling rate recorded, at the time the FTT becomes chargeable, on the most representative exchange market of the Member State concerned, or an exchange rate determined by reference to that market.     The rates of FTT to be applied by Member States may not be lower than (minimum rates):      0.1 % for all financial transactions other than those concerning derivatives agreements;       0.01 % for all financial transactions concerning derivatives agreements.       Payment of FTT, related obligations and prevention of evasion, avoidance and abuse      FTT shall be payable by each financial institution (deemed to be established in a Member State) which fulfils any of the following conditions:      it is party to the transaction, acting either for its own account or for the account of another person;       it is acting in the name of a party to the transaction;       the transaction has been carried out on its account.      It should be noted, therefore, that any financial institution which is party to a transaction or is involved in a transaction shall be liable for the tax. A single financial transaction may therefore result in payment of the tax on both sides of the transaction, at the rate applicable in the Member State of establishment of the financial institution concerned.     However, where a financial institution acts in the name of or for the account of another financial institution, only the latter shall be required to pay FTT.     Moreover, each party to a transaction shall become       jointly and severally liable      for the payment of the tax due by a financial institution on account of that transaction.     FTT shall be paid to the financial authorities of the Member States at the following points in time:      at the moment when the tax becomes chargeable in case the transaction is carried out electronically;       within three working days from the moment the tax becomes chargeable in all other cases.      Member States shall establish other obligations intended to ensure payment and to verify payment of the tax.     Member States may not introduce or maintain taxes on financial transactions other than FTT or       value added tax      (VAT) provided for by the VAT Directive.      Context      On 7 October 2010, the European Commission examined the importance of developing a financial transaction tax (FTT) in its Communication on       taxation of the financial sector      . This Proposal for a Directive puts that development into practice and therefore represents a first step towards a more global system of taxation.       Key terms of the Act         ‘Financial transaction’ means any of the following:        Reference           Proposal               Official Journal               Procedure                COM(2011) 594                -               Consultation                 2011/0261/CNS           See also      Directorate General Taxation and Customs Union –         Taxation of the financial sector       Last updated: 23.11.2011  
   Purchase of the right to use immovable property on a timeshare basis     Purchase of the right to use immovable property on a timeshare basis     Community law establishes only minimum standards for the right to use immovable properties on a timeshare basis, which explains the absence of full harmonisation in this area. The purchase contract contains only minimal obligations, such as those which the seller must respect in dealings with the consumer.     ACT     Directive       94/47/EC      of the European Parliament and the Council of 26 October 1994 on the protection of purchasers in respect of certain aspects of contracts relating to the purchase of the right to use immovable properties on a timeshare basis.     SUMMARY     The Directive covers aspects relating to:      information on the constituent parts of the contract;       the procedures for cancelling and withdrawing from the contract.      Other matters fall within the competence of the Member States.     When someone requests information, the vendor is required to supply a document containing a general description of the property and certain minimum items referred to in the Annex to the Directive (identity and domicile of the parties concerned, number of the building permit, etc.), along with details of how to obtain further information.     Such information forms an integral part of the contract.     The Directive lists the minimum items which must be included in the contract and determines the language in which the contract is to be drawn up. The contract must be drafted in the Community language(s) of the place where the purchaser lives or in the language(s) of the Member State of which they are a national.     For more information on the       use of languages for consumer information      , please consult the relevant SCADplus sheet.     The purchaser has the right to withdraw; he or she may do so, without giving any reason, within ten days of signing the contract. Only those expenses incurred as a result of the conclusion of and withdrawal from the contract are liable to be defrayed.     The purchaser's right of cancellation may be exercised within three months of signing the contract if the information required by the Directive is not included in the contract. In this event, the purchaser is not required to make any defrayal.     Any agreement covering credit granted to the purchaser by the vendor, or by a third party on the basis of an agreement concluded with the vendor, will be cancelled if the purchaser withdraws from or cancels the initial contract.     Any clauses which may be contrary to the rights of the purchaser and/or the responsibilities of the vendor under this Directive will not be binding on the purchaser.

This resolution calls on the Commission to amend the directive on the right to use immovable property on a timeshare basis. Parliament notes that the current minimalist legal approach has given rise to different laws in the various Member States and thus unequal protection for consumers. As a harmonising measure, it proposes that the cooling-off periods for consumers be extended, that this period be 28 calendar days rather than working days and that the right to cancel be clearly stated on the front face of the purchase contract.     It also calls, among other things, for this type of contract to be defined as a consumer contract, so that the general rules of Community law on the protection of consumers apply.

   Administrative cooperation in the field of excise duties     Administrative cooperation in the field of excise duties     Close cooperation is required between the administrative authorities of each Member State responsible for implementing the measures adopted in this field in order to combat excise fraud. The European Union (EU) has therefore adopted a Regulation to strengthen cooperation between Member States' tax authorities in order to combat fraud in the field of excise duties on alcohol, tobacco and energy products.     ACT     Council Regulation (EC) No       2073/2004      of 16 November 2004 on administrative cooperation in the field of excise duties.     SUMMARY     The Regulation strengthens cooperation between tax authorities in the matter of excise duties. It will ensure more direct contacts between excise departments in the Member States and so speed up the flow of information. It establishes clearer and more binding rules on cooperation between Member States and entails more automatic and spontaneous information exchange (in addition to information exchange on request).     This Regulation lays down the conditions under which the administrative authorities responsible in the Member States for implementing legislation on excise duties are to cooperate with each other, and with the Commission, in order to ensure compliance with that legislation.     To that end, it lays down rules and procedures enabling the competent authorities of the Member States to cooperate and to exchange with each other, notably by electronic means, any information that may help them to assess excise duties correctly.      The cooperation partners      Each Member State informs the other Member States and the Commission of the "competent authority" it has designated to apply this Regulation. They also designate a "central liaison office" with principal responsibility for contacts with other Member States in the field of administrative cooperation.     The central liaison office has principal responsibility for exchanges of information on movements of excisable products, and in particular:      the exchange of data stored in the electronic register of authorised warehousekeepers, registered traders and premises authorised as tax warehouses;       the electronic early-warning system;         *        verification requests to or from other Member States.      The competent authority of each Member State may also designate "liaison departments" (other than the central liaison office) or competent officials to exchange information directly.      Cooperation on request      At the request of the requesting authority       *      , the requested authority       *      will communicate any information that may help effect a correct assessment of excise duties. To do so, the requested authority may, if need be, carry out any administrative enquiry necessary to obtain this information. Requests for information and for administrative enquiries are sent using a standard form, of which there is also a simplified version.     The information is to be provided as quickly as possible, and no later than three months following the date of receipt of the request. Different time limits may be agreed by common consent between the requesting and requested authorities. Where the requested authority is unable to respond to the request by the time limit, it must immediately inform the requesting authority of the reasons for its failure to do so and indicate when it will be able to respond.     By agreement between the requesting authority and the requested authority, officials authorised by the requesting authority may be present at the offices where the administrative authorities perform duties relating to the exchange of information. They may also be present during administrative enquiries.     With a view to exchanging information, two or more Member States may agree to conduct simultaneous controls, in their own territory, of one or more persons. Such controls are often more effective.      Exchange of information without prior request      The competent authority of each Member State must, by occasional automatic or regular automatic exchange, forward information that may help correctly assess excise duties to the competent authority of any other Member State concerned, in three cases:      where an irregularity or an infringement of excise duty legislation has occurred, or is suspected to have occurred, in the other Member State;       where an irregularity or an infringement of excise duty legislation which has occurred, or is suspected to have occurred, in the territory of one Member State may have repercussions in another Member State;       where there is a risk of fraud or a loss of excise duty in the other Member State.      Outside these three situations, the competent authorities of the Member States may in any case exchange the requisite information spontaneously.     The Regulation does not oblige the Member States to impose new obligations on persons for the purposes of collecting the information they are requested to provide.      Storage and exchange of information specific to intra-Community transactions      The Regulation requires each Member State's competent authorities to maintain an electronic database containing:      a register of persons who are authorised warehousekeepers or traders registered for excise purposes;       a register of premises authorised as tax warehouses.      These registers include the identification number issued by the competent authority in respect of the person or premises, the name and address of the person or premises, the category and nomenclature relating to excise products of the products which may be held or received by the person or which may be held or received at these premises, identification of the central liaison office or the excise office from which further information may be obtained, the date of issue, amendment and where applicable, the date of cessation of validity of the authorisation as an authorised warehousekeeper or as a registered trader and the information required to identify persons who have assumed obligations or who are involved on an occasional basis in the movement of excisable products.     Each national register is available, for excise duty purposes only, to the competent authorities of the other Member States. The information is kept for at least three years from the end of the calendar year in which the movement was initiated.      Evaluating the effectiveness of this cooperation system in combating tax evasion and tax fraud      The Member States and the Commission are to examine and evaluate the working of the arrangements for administrative cooperation provided for in the Regulation. The Commission pools the Member States' experience with the aim of improving the system's operation. The Commission is assisted in this task by the Excise Committee set up by       Directive 92/12/EEC      .     To that end, Member States are to communicate to the Commission any available information relevant to their application of this Regulation, including any statistical data available, methods or practices used or suspected of having been used to contravene excise duty legislation and any shortcomings or lacunae they have revealed in the operation of the system, where it is deemed that such information is of particular interest to other Member States. Such information contain no individual or personal data.     Every five years from the date of entry into force of the Regulation and based in particular on the information provided by the Member States, the Commission reports to the European Parliament and to the Council on this Regulation's application.      Relations with third countries      When the competent authority of a Member State receives information from a third country, that authority may pass the information on to the competent authorities of any Member States which might be interested, in so far as permitted by assistance arrangements with that particular third country. Such information may also be passed on to the Commission whenever it is of Community interest.     In exchange, provided a third country has given a legal undertaking to provide the assistance required to gather evidence of the irregular nature of transactions which appear to contravene excise duty legislation, information obtained under the Regulation may be communicated to it.      Conditions governing the exchange of information      The requested authority in one Member State must provide the requesting authority in another Member State with the information referred to in the Regulation provided that:      the number and the nature of the requests for information made by the requesting authority within a specific period do not impose a disproportionate administrative burden on the requested authority;       the requesting authority has exhausted the usual sources of information which it could have used in the circumstances to obtain the information requested, without running the risk of jeopardising the achievement of the desired end.      The competent authority of a Member State may refuse to forward information if the requesting Member State cannot, for legal reasons, provide similar information. The provision of information may be refused where it would lead to the disclosure of a commercial, industrial or professional secret or of a commercial process, or where its disclosure would be contrary to public policy.     Information communicated pursuant to the Regulation should, as far as possible, be provided by electronic means.      Background      Close cooperation is required between the administrative authorities of each Member State responsible for implementing the measures adopted in this field in order to combat excise fraud.     It is therefore essential to define the rules under which the administrative authorities of the Member States must afford each other mutual assistance and cooperate with the Commission to ensure that the rules relating to the movement of excisable products and the collection of excise duties are correctly applied.     As the EU lacked an act specifically concerning administrative cooperation in the field of excise duties, the Council has adopted this Regulation in order to strengthen, simplify and replace the provisions of       Directives 77/799/EEC      and 92/12/EEC concerning administrative cooperation in that field. The Regulation also complements the scheme to computerise the movement of excisable products (Decision       2003/1152/EC)      .       Key terms used in the act         Electronic early warning system: a system under which the central liaison office or a liaison department in the Member State of departure of the excisable products can send an information or warning message to the liaison office in the Member State of destination as soon as that liaison office or liaison department is in possession of the accompanying administrative document information, and at the latest when the products are dispatched.         Requesting authority: the central liaison office of a Member State or any liaison department or competent official of that Member State requesting assistance on behalf of the competent authority.         Requested authority: the central liaison office of a Member State or any liaison department or competent official of that Member State requesting assistance on behalf of the competent authority.

summary of   Decision 98/249/EC — concluding a convention protecting the marine environment of the North-East Atlantic    Convention for the protection of the marine environment of the North-East Atlantic   what is the aim of the decision and of the convention   The decision concluded the OSPAR Convention, on behalf of the European Union (EU) — at the time known as the European Community.   The OSPAR Convention aims to prevent and eliminate marine pollution and thus to protect the north-east Atlantic area against the adverse effects of human activities.   key points    The European Community is a Contracting Party to the Convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east Atlantic, which was signed in Paris on 22 September 1992.   The convention lays down various definitions such as:   maritime area  *  ,   internal waters  *  ,   pollution  *  .     The parties to the convention undertook to take all possible steps to:   prevent and eliminate pollution,   implement the necessary measures to protect the north-east Atlantic against the adverse effects of human activities.     These measures seek to safeguard human health, to conserve maritime ecosystems and, when practicable, to restore marine areas which have been harmed. To this end, the parties will (individually and jointly):   adopt programmes and measures,   harmonise their policies and strategies.     To meet their obligations, the parties must observe 2 principles.   The  precautionary principle  : preventive measures are to be taken when there are reasonable grounds for concern that substances or energy introduced, directly or indirectly, into the marine environment may do any of the following, even when there is no conclusive evidence of a causal relationship between the inputs and the effects;   Bring about hazards to human health.   Harm living resources and marine ecosystems.   Damage amenities.   Interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea.     The  polluter pays principle  :the costs of pollution prevention, control and reduction measures are to be borne by the polluter.     The programmes the parties set up must take account of the latest technological developments and best environmental practice.   The measures taken must not increase pollution of the sea outside the maritime area or in other parts of the environment.   The parties, individually or jointly, agree to take all possible steps to prevent and eliminate:   pollution of the maritime area from  land-based sources and activities  ;   pollution by  dumping or incineration  of wastes or other matter in the ocean;   pollution from  offshore sources  (offshore installations and pipelines from which substances or energy reach the maritime area).     A cooperation agreement may be negotiated between the parties to tackle transboundary pollution.    Ospar Commission    The convention sets up a Commission which is the decision-making body of the convention and consists of representatives of the parties. The commission discusses and adopts various decisions and recommendations. Decisions become binding on the contracting parties after a period of 200 days, while recommendations are not binding.   Its duties are to:   supervise the implementation of the convention;   review the condition of the maritime area;   check the effectiveness of the measures being adopted;   draw up programmes and measures for the prevention and elimination of maritime pollution;   establish its programme of work;   create the instruments necessary to execute that programme.      OSPAR’s work    An  evaluation  of progress in regard to the  OSPAR Radioactive Substance Strategy  shows that the parties have achieved substantial reductions in discharges from the nuclear sector.   The parties have also adopted measures to  protect and conserve a further species  (the Atlantic salmon)  and habitat  (intertidal mudflats) both identified by OSPAR as being particularly vulnerable within the north-east Atlantic.   OSPAR announced in 2016 that 10 new  Marine Protected Areas  had been added to its network bringing the total to 423.   OSPAR has furthered the international effort to reduce  marine litter  with the creation of a fishing for litter network across the north-east Atlantic which will allow vessels to land waste in any of over 40 harbours involved. OSPAR parties have also agreed to tackle sources of marine environment  micro plastic pollution  .   OSPAR also serves as a forum for the coordinated implementation of the EU’s  Maritime Strategy Framework Directive  (MSFD) by EU countries and for  interregional cooperation  based on MSFD concepts and methods.    Research    The convention requires the establishment of complementary or joint programmes of scientific or technical research, to be transmitted to the commission.    Arbitration procedure    An arbitration procedure is laid down for the settlement of disputes between contracting parties.    Annexes   The OSPAR Convention contains Annexes which deal with the following specific areas    Annex I  : Prevention and elimination of pollution from land-based sources    Annex II  : Prevention and elimination of pollution by dumping or incineration    Annex III  : Prevention and elimination of pollution from offshore sources    Annex IV  : Assessment of the quality of the marine environment    Annex V  : On the protection and conservation of the ecosystems and biological diversity of the maritime area.    EU Arctic strategy   A 2016 joint communication recommends the EU’s   continued engagement in multilateral environmental agreements that also have particular relevance to the Arctic, such as OSPAR;   establishing marine protected areas in the Arctic in order to preserve biodiversity;   working with Arctic states and other international partners to develop an instrument under the  United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction.   from when do the decision and the convention apply   The decision applies from 7 October 1997.   The convention entered into force on 25 March 1998. It replaces the Oslo (1972) and Paris (1974) Conventions.   The convention has been signed and ratified by Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom (   1   ) which, with the EU, cooperate to protect the north-east Atlantic 's marine environment.   background   For more information, see:    The OSPAR Convention  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Maritime area:   all of the following:   The internal waters and the territorial seas of the contracting parties.   The sea beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea under the jurisdiction of the coastal state to the extent recognised by international law.   The high seas, including the bed of all those waters and its subsoil, situated within the following limits:      Those parts of the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans and their dependent seas which lie north of 36° north latitude and between 42° west longitude and 51° east longitude but excluding   the Baltic Sea and the Belts lying to the south and east of lines drawn from Hasenore Head to Gniben Point, from Korshage to Spodsbjerg and from Gilbjerg Head to Kullen, and   the Mediterranean Sea and its dependent seas as far as the point of intersection of the parallel of 36° north latitude and the meridian of 5° 36' west longitude.     That part of the Atlantic Ocean north of 59° north latitude and between 44° west longitude and 42° west longitude.     Internal waters:  the waters of the landward side of the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured (extending in the case of watercourses up to the freshwater limit (the place in a watercourse where, at low tide and in a period of low freshwater flow, there is an appreciable increase in salinity due to the presence of seawater)).   Pollution:   the introduction by man, directly or indirectly, of substances or energy into the maritime area which results, or is likely to result, in any of the following:      hazards to human health,   harm to living resources and marine ecosystems,   damage to amenities,   interference with other legitimate uses of the sea.    main documents   Council Decision  98/249/EC  of 7 October 1997 on the conclusion of the Convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east Atlantic (OJ L 104, 3.4.1998, p. 1)   Convention  for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east Atlantic (OJ L 104, 3.4.1998, pp. 2–21)
   The Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund     The Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund     A proposal has been made to set up a Global Fund of risk capital with a budget of 100 million to mobilise private investment in projects promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy in developing countries and emerging economies.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 6 October 2006: "Mobilising public and private finance towards global access to climate-friendly, affordable and secure energy services: The Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund" [       COM(2006) 583      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund (GEEREF) proposed by the European Commission will help mobilise private investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy projects.     Boosting such projects will substantially contribute towards sustainable development. It will provide benefits in terms of the environment, climate change and air quality and will also have social and economic benefits in terms of business, job and income creation at local level. It will also help to stabilise energy supply in the poorest regions of the world.      Overcoming investment barriers      Boosting renewable energy and energy efficiency technology calls for investment, in particular in developing countries and emerging economies. Although the prospects are promising, several factors block the participation of private-sector investors and projects and businesses have major difficulties in raising risk capital, which provides vital collateral for lenders.     One of the key reasons causing this block to investments is the significantly higher cost of initial investment in renewable energy generation than for conventional energy. While these costs are compensated by much lower running costs, private-sector investors still regard the longer repayment periods as too risky.     The various risks in developing countries are another hurdle, which means that investors look for additional reassurances.     Moreover, renewable energy technologies are often suited to small and medium sized projects with less than 5-10 million in total capital, whilst international finance institutions and the private sector traditionally do not invest in such small-scale projects.      The GEEREF, a public-private partnership.      The GEEREF will establish a public-private partnership by offering ways of risk sharing and co-financing for projects investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency.     It will mainly target the raising of "patient" risk capital, in other words, capital invested with a long-term prospect of return on the investment. GEEREF participation will range from between 25 and 50 % for medium to high-risk operations to 15 % for low-risk operations. Provision will also be made for dedicated technical assistance funds.     Rather than providing finance directly to projects, GEEREF will help create and fund regional sub-funds or scale up similar existing initiatives. Sub-funds will accommodate the specific conditions and needs of each region.      Beneficiaries      The GEEREF will support projects and businesses engaged in improving energy efficiency and renewable energy. Priority will be given to deploying environmentally sound technologies with a proven technical track record. Special focus will be given to investments of less than 10 million since they are often ignored by commercial investors and international financial institutions.     Regional sub-funds will be set up for the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) region, North Africa, non-EU Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia.      Incentives to support and contribute to the Fund      The minimum funding target for the GEEREF was set at 100 million for it to have a meaningful impact at global level and to be sufficient to establish a public-private partnership that will be self-sustaining over time.     An initial budget of 100 million should be enough to harness additional risk capital, through the sub-fund structure, of 300 million and, in the long term, up to 1 billion.     The European Commission intends to contribute 80 million to the GEEREF for the period 2007-10 with an initial contribution of 15 million proposed for 2007. It hopes that other public and private sources will contribute towards meeting the 100 million target set for the GEEREF.     International financial institutions, such as the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), private-sector investors and other financial intermediaries have already expressed their intention to contribute to this initiative.     Member States, members of the European Economic Area (EEA) and other financial institutions are also invited to participate.      Background      The constant increase in demand for global energy has serious consequences, in particular in terms of air quality, resources and access to energy. The need to ensure sustainable development requires not only combating climate change but also eradicating energy poverty and securing energy supply. It is therefore essential to harness investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy.     The GEEREF initiative is an integral part of the approach put forward in the Green Paper "       A European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy      ".

summary of   Decision 2013/103/EU signing and conclusion of the agreement on the EU’s accession to the Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail (COTIF), as amended by the 1999 Vilnius Protocol    Agreement on the EU’s accession to the Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail (COTIF), as amended by the 1999 Vilnius Protocol   what is the aim of the agreement and the decision  The decision concludes on behalf of the EU the agreement to accede to the Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail (COTIF), as amended by the  1999 Vilnius Protocol  .  The decision gives the EU exclusive  competence  to legislate on various rail transport matters which are covered by COTIF.   key points   The  Intergovernmental Organisation for International Carriage by Rail (OTIF)  was established on 1 May 1985 following the 1980 Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail (COTIF 1980). COTIF 1980 was subsequently amended by the Vilnius Protocol of 3 June 1999 (now COTIF 1999).  The Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail (COTIF) is OTIF’s basic text. It governs the running of the organisation, as well as its objectives, attributions, relations with its member countries and its activities in general.  The aim of OTIF is to  promote, improve and facilitate international rail traffic  , in particular by:   establishing and developing systems of uniform law in regard to:   the international carriage of passengers and goods in international rail traffic;   the use of wagons as means of transport in international rail traffic;   the use of infrastructure in international rail traffic;   the carriage of dangerous goods in international rail traffic;     contributing to removing certain obstacles to the crossing of frontiers in international rail traffic;   contributing to interoperability and technical harmonisation in the rail sector;   establishing a uniform procedure for the technical admission of railway material intended for use in international traffic;   monitoring the application of all the rules and recommendations established by OTIF.   In line with  Article 3(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union  , the EU has exclusive competence to legislate on various rail transport matters which are covered by COTIF. The accession of the EU to COTIF is therefore essential to enable the EU to exercise its competence in international rail relations where this internal competence has been established. For this reason, EU countries meeting in the Council agree an EU position prior to the EU’s participation in COTIF meetings. EU accession to COTIF also safeguards legal security for other OTIF members entering into rail relations with EU countries, since the latter may no longer enjoy rights or assume obligations individually with respect to non-EU countries on matters where the EU as a whole is competent.  EU accession to COTIF facilitates the development of a uniform legal system applicable to the international carriage of passengers and freight by rail across the countries which are members of OTIF. Accession is not only a legal obligation for the EU; it is also in the interest of the promotion of rail transport worldwide.  OTIF headquarters are based in Bern, Switzerland and the running of the organisation is ensured by:   the  Secretary General  ,   the  General Assembly  ,   the  Administrative Committee  ,   the  Revision Committee  ,   the  Committee of Experts for the Carriage of Dangerous Goods  ,   the  Committee of Technical Experts  , and   the  Rail Facilitation Committee  .   OTIF currently has  49 member countries  from Europe, the Middle East, Asia and North Africa, and  1 associate member country  (Jordan).   date of entry into force   The agreement entered into force on 1 July 2011 and the EU acceded to this convention, as a regional economic integration organisation.   background   For more information, see:    About OTIF  (  OTIF  ).   main documents   Council Decision  2013/103/EU  of 16 June 2011 on the signing and conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Intergovernmental Organisation for International Carriage by Rail on the Accession of the European Union to the Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail (COTIF) of 9 May 1980, as amended by the Vilnius Protocol of 3 June 1999 (OJ L 51, 23.2.2013, pp. 1-7)   Agreement  between the European Union and the Intergovernmental Organisation for International Carriage by Rail on the Accession of the European Union to the Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail (COTIF) of 9 May 1980, as amended by the Vilnius Protocol of 3 June 1999 (OJ L 51, 23.2.2013, pp. 8-10)
act   Directive  1999/62/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 1999 on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures.   summary    what does the directive do  It replaces earlier legislation - Directive 93/89/EEC - which had been annulled by the European Court of Justice in 1995. It harmonises the conditions under which national authorities may apply taxes, tolls and user charges on goods carried by road.   key points    Financial charges initially only applied to vehicles with a maximum gross laden weight of 12 tonnes. From 2012, this was extended to vehicles over 3.5 tonnes.   They may be levied on motorways, bridges, tunnels, mountain passes and certain other categories of roads.   Charges may not discriminate between the haulier’s nationality or the vehicle’s origin or destination.   Mandatory controls at internal EU borders are forbidden.   Charges may vary depending on emissions produced or the time the road infrastructure is used.   National authorities may levy other taxes in specific circumstances, such as registration, abnormal loads and parking or to avoid congestion.   Charges do not apply to vehicles registered in the Canaries, Ceuta and Melilla, the Azores or Madeira operating in those territories or between them and Spain and Portugal.    Directive 2003/96/EC  sets minimum tax levels for all motor fuels. Countries with road user charges may apply a reduced rate for gas oil used by those vehicles.   when does the directive apply  From 20 July 1999.   background   In 2014, the Commission adopted a  strategy  to reduce fuel consumption and CO  2  emissions from transport.

   Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) (2007-2013)     Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) (2007-2013)     Reflecting the objectives of the Lisbon strategy, the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme CIP supports measures to strengthen competitiveness and innovation capacity in the European Union (EU) for the period 2007-2013. It particularly encourages the use of information technologies, environmental technologies and renewable energy sources.     ACT     Decision       1639/2006/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 2006 establishing a Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (2007-2013) [       See amending act(s)      ].     SUMMARY     The Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) proposes a coherent framework to improve competitiveness       *      and innovation capacity       *      in the European Union (EU). The actions it supports encourage the development of a knowledge society and sustainable development based on balanced economic growth.     The framework programme incorporates specific Community support programmes, new actions and synergies with other programmes, thus meeting the objectives of the       renewed Lisbon Strategy      for simpler, more visible and better targeted Community action.      Specific programmes      To take account of the diversity of its objectives and ensure that these are visible, the CIP is made up of three specific subprogrammes. The interests of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and eco-innovation are cross-cutting priorities reflected throughout the framework programme.       The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme        brings together activities to promote entrepreneurship, industrial competitiveness and innovation. It specifically targets SMEs         *        , from hi-tech “gazelles” (companies with high growth potential) to the traditional micro-businesses and family firms which make up a large majority of European enterprises. It facilitates SMEs’ access to finance and investment during their start-up and growth phase. It also gives businesses access to information and advice on the functioning and opportunities of the internal market, as well as to information on Community legislation applying to them and on future legislation so that they can prepare to adapt in a cost-effective way. In this context, the         Enterprise Europe Network        plays an important role. The programme also makes provision for the exchange of best practices between Member States in order to create a better regulatory and administrative environment for business and innovation. Finally, it backs the promotion of eco-innovation         *        by encouraging efforts to tap the full potential of environmental technologies.       The         objective of the ICT Policy Support Programme        is to promote the adoption and use of information and communication technologies (ICT), the backbone of the knowledge economy. The uptake of ICTs by both the private and public sectors helps to stimulate European innovation performance and competitiveness. The programme forms part of the         Digital Agenda for Europe        and incorporates the instruments previously financed by the eTen, eContent and Modinis programmes.       The         Intelligent Energy – Europe Programme        helps speed up efforts to achieve the objectives in the field of sustainable energy. It supports improvements in energy efficiency, the adoption of new and renewable energy sources, greater market penetration for these energy sources, energy and fuel diversification, an increase in the share of renewable energy (the EU has set itself the objective of raising the share of renewable energy in gross domestic consumption to 12 % by 2010) and a reduction in final energy consumption. Particular attention is paid in this context to the transport sector. The programme follows up the         Intelligent Energy – Europe (2003-2006)        programme, which expired on 31 December 2006.       Implementation      Implementation of the CIP relies on several instruments (financial instruments, projects, networks, analyses, etc.), which can be applied in each of the specific programmes. This common “toolbox” for the different programmes helps to simplify the way the framework programme works for its users. The CIP is not just based on tried and tested measures, but also introduces new instruments.     Several Community financial instruments are involved in business support. The High Growth and Innovative SME Facility (GIF) promotes the supply of seed and early-stage capital for SMEs for their start-up, and a new feature introduced by the CIP is the provision of “follow-on” capital during their growth phase. The SME Guarantee Facility, for its part, facilitates access for SMEs to financing (loans or leasing), microcredit and equity or quasi-equity. This facility also includes a new securitisation instrument for bank loan portfolios to help mobilise additional loan financing for SMEs.     The CIP strengthens and develops business and innovation support services which disseminate information to businesses on Community policies, legislation and programmes, particularly concerning the internal market and framework research programmes. These services also offer businesses information on innovation, technology and knowledge transfer and provide feedback from them for impact assessments and policy development.     A new mechanism fosters cooperation among national and regional programmes to promote business innovation, thus providing businesses with other ways of benefiting from ideas, know-how and market opportunities in other European regions.     The framework programme also supports pilot market replication projects. These aim to promote the effective marketing and economic exploitation of innovative or eco-innovative technologies and products which have already been technically demonstrated with success but have not yet penetrated the market to a significant extent. These projects are implemented through public-private partnerships.     The Intelligent Energy Executive Agency is responsible for the implementation of action under the “Intelligent Energy – Europe” programme and action under the “Enterprise and Innovation” programme.     In order to optimise the flow of knowledge and ideas, the strategic development of Community policies must continue on the basis of the open method of coordination and be backed up by new twinning actions to help Member States and regions exploit examples of best practice.      Consistency with other Community policies      The CIP links up with other key Community initiatives. Their different activities are implemented in parallel and complement each other. The framework programme is thus involved in achieving Community objectives in the fields of research, cohesion, the environment, education and training.     The CIP thus facilitates access to finance for businesses whose activities relate to innovation, research and development. It also helps businesses get involved in the       7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development      (FP7-RTD).      Budget      The framework programme will run for seven years, from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013. It has been allocated a budget of €3.621 billion for that period.     According to an indicative breakdown, 60 % of the overall budget (€2.170 billion) is allocated to the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme. One fifth of this (€430 million) is earmarked for promoting eco-innovation. 20 % of the overall budget (€730 million) has been allocated to the ICT Policy Support Programme, and the last 20 % (€730 million) is for the Intelligent Energy – Europe Programme.     Costs that are eligible under several instruments cannot be funded twice.      Monitoring and assessment      The Commission carries out regular monitoring of the implementation of the framework-programme and the specific programmes which come under it. Each year it drafts a report to provide an update of the activities supported using indicators concerning the financial implementation, the results achieved and, where possible, the impact of the actions implemented.     The framework-programme and the specific programmes which come under it are subject to an intermediary assessment and a final assessment. These assessments examine aspects such as the relevance, the coherence and synergies, effectiveness, the efficient use of resources, and the sustainability, etc. of the actions. Furthermore, the final assessment verifies to what extent the framework-programme as a whole, and each of its specific individual programmes, have achieved their objectives.      Context      The       Lisbon Process      , whose objective is to make Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, has naturally made competitiveness one of the EU’s key political concerns. In order to ensure greater coherence between the different programmes involved in the Community’s efforts to enhance competitiveness, and in response to the objectives set by the renewed Lisbon Strategy, the European Commission is proposing a framework programme for innovation and competitiveness.       Key terms used in the act         Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)           :          Competitiveness: the capacity of enterprises to adapt quickly to change, exploit their innovation potential and develop high-quality products.         Innovation: renewal and extension of the range of products and services, introduction of new design, production, supply and distribution methods, introduction of changes to management methods, work organisation and employees’ terms and conditions of employment and qualifications.         Eco-innovation: any form of innovation intended to achieve the objective of sustainable environmentally-friendly development by reducing the impact on the environment or by using natural resources, especially energy, in a more efficient and responsible manner.

   eEurope 2005     eEurope 2005     The eEurope 2005 action plan succeeds the       2002 action plan      which mainly focused on Internet connectivity in Europe. The new action plan, which was approved by the Seville European Council in June 2002, is aimed at translating this connectivity into increased economic productivity and improved quality and accessibility of services for all European citizens based on a secure broadband infrastructure available to the largest possible number of people.     ACT     Communication of 28 May 2002 from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions – The       e      Europe 2005 action plan: an information society for everyone [       COM(2002) 263 final      - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The general objective of the       e      Europe 2005 action plan is to stimulate the development of services, applications and contents while speeding up the deployment of secure       broadband      Internet access. Broadband will ensure high-speed and continuous access to the Internet. There is also the general aim of providing access for everyone in order to combat social exclusion, whether it is due to particular needs, a disability, age or illness.     The main objectives to be achieved by 2005 in the framework of       e      Europe 2005 are:      modern online public services:       e-government services;           e-learning            services;           e-health services.         a dynamic e-business environment;       a secure information infrastructure;       widespread availability of broadband access at competitive prices;       benchmarking and the dissemination of good practice.       e      Europe 2005 follows the same approach as       e      Europe 2002, which is to define clear objectives and to benchmark progress as it is made. It also aims to speed up the adoption of new legislative instruments and to redirect programmes towards the priorities identified.      MODERN ONLINE PUBLIC SERVICES       e-government       e      Europe 2005 proposes the following activities for the introduction of modern online public services:      providing broadband connections for all public authorities by 2005;       the adoption by the Commission, by the end of 2003, of a framework for interoperability to facilitate the provision of pan-European e-government services for citizens and businesses. Interoperability means the capacity with which two programmes (a client and a server, for example) are able to exchange and interpret their data properly;       interactive public services which are accessible to everyone via broadband networks and multi-platform access (telephone, television, PC, etc.) by the end of 2004;       most public supply contracts to be awarded electronically by the end of 2005;       ease of access for all citizens to public access points to the Internet (PAPI).       e-learning      The action plan encourages further use of electronic means of teaching, as with the       e-learning      initiative. In this framework,       e      Europe 2005 proposes a series of targeted measures, including:      broadband Internet access for all schools and universities by 2005;       online access to be made available by universities to students and researchers by the end of 2005 - with the support of the e-learning and         e        Ten programmes;       the launching by the Commission, by the end of 2003, of research activities on the deployment of computer networks and platforms based on high-performance design infrastructures;       the launching by the Member States, with support from the Structural Funds, of training activities to provide adults with the skills needed to work in a knowledge-based society.       e-health      The action plan emphasises that digital technologies offer substantial benefits for health management. They offer the potential not only to reduce administrative costs, but also to deliver health care services at a distance and to provide medical information and preventative services. In this field, the       e      Europe 2005 action plan provides for:      the presentation by the Commission, in the spring of 2003, of a proposal for the introduction of a pan-European health insurance card, which will replace the paper forms currently needed to obtain care in another Member State;       the establishment by the Member States of health information networks between points of care (hospitals, laboratories and homes);       the provision of online health services to the general public (e.g. electronic medical records, teleconsultation,         e        Reimbursement).       A DYNAMIC e-BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT      e-business comprises both e-commerce (buying and selling online) and business restructuring processes. In this field, the activities envisaged include:      reassessment by the Commission of the current legislation in order to identify and, where necessary, eliminate factors which prevent businesses from launching into e-business. An e-business summit, planned for 2003, will mark the launching of this reassessment, which is open to all parties concerned;       the establishment by the Commission of a European         e        Business network to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in order to strengthen and coordinate activities to assist         e        Business;       private sector development of interoperable         e        Business solutions for transactions, security, procurement and payments.       A SECURE INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE      The gradual introduction of a secure information infrastructure is one of the main objectives of the       e      Europe 2005 action plan. Measures have already been adopted in this field at European Union level: a proposal from the Commission in June 2001 on network security, combating cyber crime in the framework of the       e      Europe 2002 action plan, a Directive on the protection of personal data in the telecommunications sector, and activities under the research framework programme. In the field of security, the new action plan proposes the following activities:      the establishment of a cyber security task force - on the basis of a proposal which the Commission should put forward in 2002;       the introduction by the public and private sectors of a "security culture" in the design and implementation of information and communication products;       examining the possibility for secure communications between public services.       WIDE AVAILABILITY OF BROADBAND ACCESS      The       e      Europe 2005 action plan calls for the stimulation of innovation and increased use of and investment in broadband communications. To achieve this, the action plan focuses on the following activities:      use of the new regulatory framework for radio spectrum policy to guarantee frequency availability for wireless broadband services;       support for broadband access in less-favoured areas;       increased provision by public authorities of their contents on different interactive technological platforms;       speeding up the transition to digital television.       BENCHMARKING      The action plan also provides for measures for the analysis, identification and dissemination of good practices, in particular through conferences and support networks. In the framework of the benchmarking exercise launched by       e      Europe 2002, it is planned that a list of indicators and a renewed methodology will be put in place at European Union level by the end of 2002.     RELATED ACTS      REVIEW OF         e        EUROPE 2005       Communication from the Commission of 21 August 2009 to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - Final Evaluation of the eEurope 2005 Action Plan and of the multiannual programme (2003-2006) for the monitoring of eEurope 2005 Action Plan, dissemination of good practices and the improvement of network and information security (Modinis) [         COM(2009) 432 final        – Not published in the Official Journal].      This Communication reports on the final evaluation of the eEurope 2005 Action Plan and the Modinis Programme.     With regard to the eEurope 2005 Action Plan, the evaluators found the strategy to be useful and relevant. In fact, the Programme had enabled a dialogue between countries with very different cultures and references to be set up and maintained. Weaknesses were noted concerning the stakeholders’ group, which did not appear to fulfil its advisory role in a satisfactory manner.     The Modinis Programme also received a positive assessment in that it added value to Member States’ activities. However, a lack of transparency was found in the relationship between the Modinis Management Committee and the eEurope Advisory Group.     The weaknesses identified did not, however, affect the implementation of the Programme. They have been taken into account under the framework of the i2010 Initiative and one of its main funding instruments (ICT-PSP).      Commission communication of 18 February 2004 "         e        Europe 2005 mid-term review" [         COM(2004) 108        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      The report highlights the encouraging results produced by the action plan in many fields, particularly on broadband connections and e-government. The proportion of basic government services fully available online grew from 17% to 43% between October 2001 and October 2003. In addition, the number of broadband connections in the EU almost doubled between 2002 and 2003.     The report gives details of the progress made in seven fields and pinpoints the areas where further efforts are needed:       e-government        : Good progress has been made in this area, but wide differences persist between Member States in terms of the range of services available. Reinforced cooperation is needed at EU level on policy orientation and financial support.        e-learning        : Almost every educational and training centre is now connected to the Internet. The review of the action plan will have to address the need systematically to evaluate the lessons that have been learnt from all the initiatives and pilot actions.        e-health        : e-health is becoming a central aspect of health policy at regional, national and European level. However, work needs to continue on the e-health activities proposed in         e        Europe: electronic health cards; online health services and health information networks. A firm political commitment is needed to create Europe-wide interoperability in this field.        e-business        : Despite a steady increase in buying and selling on-line, achievements in the e-business field should extend beyond e-commerce to encompass the full integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) into business processes. Once again, the insufficient interoperability of business applications impedes the adoption of new forms of collaboration. Efforts must also continue on the establishment of the         .eu top level domain        and the adoption of secure and effective e-payment systems.        Broadband        : The broadband market is expanding fast. However, the EU must overcome two challenges before it can reap the full benefits of broadband:          private investment in broadband networks in less favoured areas is held back by fears for its profitability;           the take-up of broadband lags behind availability in all Member States.         The review of the action plan will therefore have to bring about a shift to demand patterns. Further ahead, it will also have to address the issue of digital rights management (DRM).        Security        : Almost 80% of European citizens are afraid of buying over the Internet, while only 54% of companies have a formal security policy. Network and information security is one of the top priorities for the EU since it is a prerequisite for development of the information society. This high priority was reflected, in particular, by the rapid adoption of the regulation to establish a European Network and Information Security Agency.        e-inclusion        : e-inclusion is a horizontal concern for all areas of         e        Europe 2005. In particular, a greater focus is needed on the establishment of European network accessibility standards, on web accessibility initiative (WAI) guidelines and common labelling for accessible web pages. Multi-platform access (via PC, digital TV,         3rd generation mobile telephones        , etc.) must be promoted to improve accessibility for excluded groups and disadvantaged regions.      The report will provide the starting-point for discussion with the Member States and stakeholders to decide the adjustments needed to       e      Europe 2005 by the summer of 2004.

   Black Sea Synergy     Black Sea Synergy     The Black Sea region, which includes Bulgaria and Romania, occupies a strategic position between Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East. The European Union intends to support regional commitments tending to increase mutual confidence and remove obstacles to the stability, security and prosperity of the countries in this region.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 11 April 2007 - Black Sea Synergy - A new regional cooperation initiative [       COM(2007) 160      final - Not yet published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Black Sea Synergy is a cooperation initiative that proposes a new dynamic for the region, its countries and their citizens. Regional cooperation could provide additional value to initiatives in areas of common interest and serve as a bridge to help strengthen relations with neighbouring countries and regions (Caspian Sea, Central Asia, South-eastern Europe).     In this context, Black Sea Synergy could reinforce the impact of existing cooperation instruments (the pre-accession process in the case of Turkey, the       European Neighbourhood Policy      (ENP) and the Strategic Partnership with Russia) and regional initiatives (Danube Cooperation Process).      Areas of cooperation      The EU proposes to build on its experience to support initiatives promoting democracy, respect for human rights and good governance through training, exchanges and regional dialogues with civil society.     It will also make use of institutions like the South-east European Cooperation Initiative (SECI) to tackle issues of migration and security. Improving border management and customs cooperation will help prevent irregular migration and fight against organised cross-border crime (trafficking in human beings, arms and drugs,).     The EC advocates a more active role in addressing frozen conflicts (Transnistria, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Nagorno-Karabakh). Cooperation programmes offer a way of tackling issues of governance, security, social cohesion and economic development.     As regards energy, the EU will continue to enhance its relations with energy producers, transit countries and consumers for energy supply security, an area in which the Black Sea region is of strategic importance. The various instruments in place, both specific (       Baku Initiative      , dialogue on energy security, ENP) and general (bilateral relations, expansion of the Energy Community Treaty,       WTO      accession), are a means of working towards regulatory harmonisation and providing a clear, transparent and non-discriminatory framework. The EU also supports research into alternative energy sources, energy efficiency and energy saving, as well as the modernisation of infrastructures and the development of a new trans-Caspian trans-Black Sea energy corridor.     The EC should continue to support regional transport cooperation initiatives to improve the efficiency, safety and security of       transport operations      and improve coordination, notably through the extension of the Trans-European Transport Network (       TEN-T      ) and the       TRACECA      programme. Other essential objectives include harmonising the regulatory framework through a dialogue on transport, uniform application of instruments and standards, extending the common aviation area and enhancing aviation and maritime safety.     As regards the protection of the environment, Member States will be encouraged to work within the framework of regional seas conventions. The implementation of multilateral agreements and a broader strategic cooperation are also essential, as is regional activity to combat climate change.     The EU's emerging maritime policy should embrace all the countries in the region, and focus on developing a cross-sectoral maritime cooperation network. As regards fisheries, the management of fisheries resources should be strengthened to promote sustainable and responsible use of stocks.     In the trade sector, the closer economic cooperation needed to encourage trade liberalisation should be based on preferential trade relations, WTO accession, agreements with Russia and Ukraine, and the implementation of ENP action plans to promote harmonisation of laws and regulations.     Cooperation in the context of research and education networks is another aspect of this synergy. It aims at developing on-line services and e-commerce, the interconnection of all countries in the area to the pan-European research backbone       GEANT      and providing high-speed connectivity. The       Tempus      programme is another instrument for cooperation in the field of higher education.     In the field of       science and technology      , the EC intends to promote capacity-building and S&T policy dialogue with the Black Sea countries, through the       7th Research Framework Programme      and other relevant instruments.     With regard to employment and social affairs, the EU should support initiatives aimed at strengthening social cohesion and fighting poverty and social exclusion through technical assistance schemes (exchange of information and best practice, awareness-raising, training).     The lessons learned in the implementation of the EU's regional policy programmes for Bulgaria and Romania could be turned to account for regional development programmes throughout the area.      Financing      Instruments like the       ENPI      , the       European Regional Development Fund      (ERDF), the regional activities of the       European Bank for Reconstruction and Development      (EBRD), the       European Investment Bank      (EIB) and the Black Sea Trade and Development Bank provide a financing framework.      Cross-border cooperation      through the ENPI, the ERDF and the       IPA      should promote links between and strengthen the       role of local actors and civil society.      In addition, the involvement of       regional organisations      should guarantee an appropriate level of regional cooperation, following the example of the       Organisation for Black Sea Economic Cooperation      (BSEC), to which all the countries in the region belong. Civil society organisations, under the aegis of the Black Sea Forum, could also provide a fertile medium for cooperation initiatives.     The strengthening of the European Neighbourhood Policy, including the building of a thematic dimension to the ENP and the gradual development of deep and comprehensive Free Trade Agreements, would enrich Black Sea cooperation. Regional contacts should be facilitated by the removal of obstacles to legitimate travel and the promotion of university exchanges through the       Erasmus Mundus      and Tempus programmes. The Neighbourhood Investment Facility for countries with ENP Action Plans will help finance infrastructure investments, particularly in the fields of energy, transport and the environment.

summary of   Article 19 Treaty on European Union   what is the aim of article 19 of the treaty on european union    Article 19 of the Treaty on European Union  (TEU) describes the role and composition of the  Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU).   It forms the legal basis of supplementary law by designating the CJEU as the ultimate court to ensure that EU law is correctly interpreted and applied, whether on actions brought directly to it or on requests for preliminary rulings  *  (for more information, see the summary on  Preliminary ruling proceedings  ).   key points    What does supplementary law mean?    Supplementary law designates the unwritten  sources of EU law  as opposed to the primary and secondary sources.   These sources are essentially used by the CJEU as rules of law in cases where the  primary  and  secondary legislation  do not settle the issue.    What are the supplementary sources of law?    The supplementary sources include the case-law  *  of the CJEU, international law  *  and the general principles of law. These 3 sources overlap.    The case-law of the CJEU    In interpreting EU law, the CJEU often needs to be creative in order to bridge the gaps left by primary law and/or secondary law.   Its judgments provide an official and legally binding interpretation of EU law and, as such, are referred to as a source of law (including by the CJEU itself).      International law    International law (including international agreements concluded by the EU and EU countries) is used by the CJEU when developing its case-law, in so far as its rules apply to the EU and they are not incompatible with the specific structure of the EU.   Besides the legal commitments of the EU and EU countries, international law is also a source of inspiration for the CJEU when drawing up general principles of law.      The general principles of law    Developed by the case-law of the CJEU, general principles have allowed the Court to implement rules in different domains of which the treaties make no mention.   General principles of EU law may be common to all the national legal systems of the EU countries and compatible with EU objectives, or specific to the EU, even if inspired from principles enshrined in certain national legal systems only.      Fundamental rights    Fundamental rights (  Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU)  ) are a special category of source of law:   partly primary — Article 6(1) TEU recognises the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union as having the same legal value as the Treaties;   partly supplementary — Article 6(3) TEU explicitly recognises as general principles of EU law ‘fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States'.     key terms    Preliminary ruling:  a ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union in reply to a question from a national court on the interpretation or validity of EU law, thereby contributing to the uniform application of that law.   Case-law:  the law as established by the outcome of former cases.   International law:  the set of rules that governs the legal relations between or among states or nations.
   Specific programme "Cooperation"     Specific programme "Cooperation"     The main aim of this specific programme is to strengthen cooperation between the various stakeholders in the research world in order to promote the practical applications of technologies and knowledge for European society. It will be able to respond more effectively to current and future social, economic, environmental and industrial challenges. This document describes the features and objectives of the programme and the main guidelines contained in it. Details are then given of the objectives, approaches and specific activities theme by theme.     ACT     Council Decision       2006/971/EC      of 19 December 2006 concerning the Specific Programme "Cooperation" implementing the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (2007 to 2013).     SUMMARY     One of the main objectives of the       Seventh Framework Programme      is to make Europe the leading world forum for science and technology. In this connection, the aim of the       Specific Programme "Cooperation"      is to support cooperation between industries, research centres and public authorities both across the European Union (EU) and with the rest of the world.     This specific programme covers nine thematic areas corresponding to major fields of knowledge and technology in which transnational cooperation should be supported in order to address social, economic, environmental and industrial challenges:      health;       food, agriculture and biotechnology;       information and communication technologies;       nanosciences, nanotechnologies, materials and new production technologies;       energy;       environment (including climate change);       transport (including aeronautics);       socio-economic sciences and the humanities;       security and space.      In budget terms, the amount deemed necessary for the implementation of the specific programme is EUR 32 413 million for the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013.      CHARACTERISTICS AND GENERAL OBJECTIVES      The specific programme "Cooperation" is intended to further the attainment of several more or less long-term objectives which will make it possible to boost the EU's       competitiveness      in science and technology.     These objectives aim:      to contribute to sustainable development within the context of promoting research at the highest level of excellence;       to promote ambitious pan-European public-private partnerships in order to accelerate the development of major technologies through the launching of         joint technology initiatives        ;       to improve the coordination of national research programmes, in particular by strengthening the         ERA-NET        scheme and establishing an ERA-NET PLUS scheme;       to implement, with the close cooperation of Member States,         four specific initiatives        , the first three of which will cover ambient assisted living, Baltic Sea research and metrology, and the fourth of which will bring together national SME-related research programmes       to pursue a more targeted approach to         international cooperation        ;       to develop, for each of the themes, a flexible response to         emerging needs        and         unforeseen policy needs        .      The main contribution of this specific programme will be to bring together resources, disciplines and scientific excellence. In addition, improved coordination of national policies, EU-wide dissemination of results, creation of pan-European research teams and networks, and work addressing pan-European policy challenges will strengthen the integration of European research and development.     To optimise monitoring of the implementation of the programme,       performance indicators      will be developed at three levels:       quantitative        and         qualitative        indicators to show the direction of scientific and technical progress (standards, tools, processes, techniques, services, etc).        management        indicators to monitor performance internally and support senior management decision-making (budget implementation, time taken to sign contracts and make payments, etc);        outcome        indicators to assess the overall effectiveness of the research against general EU objectives (e.g. impact on the achievement of the Lisbon, Göteborg, Barcelona and other objectives) and in relation to the specific programme (e.g. contribution to the EU's scientific, technological and economic performance)       THE THEMES: GUIDELINES      Implementation of the nine themes (see above) for action by the EU has several implications:      promotion of         multidisciplinarity        through joint cross-thematic approaches to research and technology subjects;       adaptation to evolving needs and opportunities ("         emerging needs        " and "         unforeseen policy needs        ") ;       strengthening of         coordination        of the         dissemination of knowledge        and         transfer of research results        including through the funding of networking/brokerage initiatives, seminars and events, assistance by external experts and information services;       facilitation of the         participation of small and medium-sized enterprises        (SMEs), in particular through improved financial and administrative procedures, better consideration of their needs and the implementation of support measures;       respect for         fundamental ethical principles        , as set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, and         social, socio-economic, cultural        and         gender equality principles        ;       promotion of         collaborative research        in order to boost the reputation of European knowhow worldwide ;       establishment, subject to certain conditions (added value, strength of commitment, inability of existing instruments to achieve the objective, etc.), of         joint technology initiatives        combining private-sector investment and national and European public funding;       coordination of (national and regional)         non-Community research programmes        via the ERA-NET scheme and Community participation;       support for international science and technology policy through         international cooperation        actions such as strategic research partnerships with third countries and problem solving on the basis of mutual interest and mutual benefit.       Health      Where health is concerned, the       objective      of the programme is twofold. On the one hand it consists of improving health conditions in Europe and worldwide and on the other increasing the competitiveness of European health-related industries and businesses.     In terms of the       approach      , emphasis will be placed on:      translational research (translation of basic discoveries into clinical applications);       development and validation of new therapies;       communication of research results;       development of methods of health promotion and disease prevention, diagnostic tools and technologies, as well as sustainable and efficient health-care systems (child health and the health of the ageing population).      This theme will cover three main areas of       activity      :      development of biotechnology and generic tools and technologies for human health;       boosting of translational research;       optimising the delivery of health care.      The       budget      for this theme will be EUR 6 100 million.      Food, agriculture and biotechnology      In this area, the       objective      is to build a knowledge-based European bio-economy by bringing together science, industry and other stakeholders. The main aim will be to tailor research to contemporary social and economic challenges (healthy food, sustainable development and production, and climate change, etc).     In terms of the       approach      , emphasis will be placed mainly on:      sustainable management, production and use of biological resources;       eco-efficiency and competitiveness of SMEs (representing 90 % of the agri-food sector).      In terms of       activities      , this will be reflected by:      the development of sustainable production and management of biological resources from land, forest, and aquatic environments;       achieving an optimum balance between food, health and well being;       the utilisation of life sciences and biotechnology for sustainable non-food products and processes (energy and industry, etc).      The budget allocated to this theme will be EUR 1 935 million.      Information and communication technologies      The       objective      here is to improve the competitiveness of European industry and shape       information and communication technologies (ICT)      so that the changing needs of European society and the European economy can be met.     The       approach      adopted focuses on:      strengthening Europe’s scientific and technology base in ICT;       stimulating innovation through ICT use;       ensuring that progress is transformed into practical benefits for Europe’s citizens, businesses, industry and public authorities.      The various       activities      envisaged will focus on:      strategic research relating to innovative ICT applications;       integration of technologies in all sectors of society through collaboration and networking actions, support to joint technology initiatives and national programme coordination initiatives.      The budget allocated to this theme will be EUR 9 050 million.      Nanosciences, nanotechnologies, materials and new production technologies      In this area, the       objective      is to improve the competitiveness of European industry and ensure its transformation from a resource-intensive to a knowledge-intensive industry.     To achieve this objective, two types of       approach      are envisaged:      the short-term approach is to focus on the convergence of knowledge and skills;       in the long term, the aim is to capitalise on the prospects offered by nanosciences and         nanotechnologies        for the creation of a knowledge-based industry and economy      In terms of       activities      , priority will be given to the interdisciplinary development of new products and materials and new processes and techniques.     The budget allocated to this theme will be EUR 3 475 million.      Energy      The main       objective      of this theme will be to transform the current fossil-fuel based energy system into a sustainable, diversified and cost-effective system able to address pressing challenges (security of supply, climate change, competitiveness).     Where the       approach      is concerned, research will therefore focus on the development of cost-effective technologies for a more sustainable and competitive       energy economy for Europe      .     The       applications      are as follows:      implementation of the hydrogen and fuel cells programme;       development of technologies for electricity production from renewables;       development of technologies for renewable fuel production;       optimum use of renewables for heating and cooling;       CO2 capture and storage technologies;       development of clean coal technologies;       development of smart energy networks (to increase efficiency, flexibility, safety and reliability);       greater energy efficiency;       use of knowledge for energy policy-making.      The budget allocated to this them will be EUR 2 350 million.      Environment      The       major challenge      here is to develop the technologies needed in order to strike a balance between human activities and sustainable management of the environment and its resources.     To this end, the       emphasis      will be placed on:      development of tools for the prevention and mitigation of         climate change        ;       implementation of the international commitments of the EU and its Member States;       promotion of innovative         ecotechnologies        ;       coordination of national programmes;       strengthening the dissemination of research results.      With regard to the       activities      to be conducted, the specific programme provides for research in several areas with a view to giving appropriate responses to future challenges:      the functioning of climate and the Earth system;       interactions between environmental risk factors and human health;       management of natural disasters;       conservation and sustainable management of natural and man-made resources;       evolution of marine environments;       utilisation of environmental technologies for the sustainable management and conservation of the environment;       technology assessment, verification and testing;       Earth observation;       the development of assessment tools;      The budget allocated to this theme will be EUR 1 890 million.      Transport      Where transport is concerned, the main       objective      is to develop systems that are more competitive, safer and "greener".     In terms of the       approach      , priority will be given to the formulation and implementation of new policies so that technological progress can be harnessed for the benefit of sustainable European transport systems. In this connection, the potential of the European global satellite navigation system, encompassing       Galileo      and EGNOS, should be exploited to the full.     Various       activities      are envisaged for both air transport and surface transport (rail, road and waterborne).     Air transport:      greening of transport systems;       increasing time efficiency (punctuality, traffic management, etc);       improving passenger satisfaction and safety;       optimising cost-efficiency;       improving the protection of aircraft and passengers;       exploring new technologies.      Surface transport:      greening of transport systems;       promoting public transport and decongesting transport corridors;       ensuring sustainable urban mobility;       improving safety and security;       increasing competitiveness.      The budget allocated to this theme will be EUR 4 160 million.      Socio-economic sciences and the humanities      Acquiring a better understanding of the various       socio-economic challenges      with which Europe is confronted (growth, employment, competitiveness, etc) is an       objective      to be attained with a view to furthering the policies in the fields concerned.     To this end, in addition to socio-economic research and humanities research, the work will also build upon relevant national research programmes. The work will be facilitated by the establishment of appropriate research infrastructures. Specific dissemination actions targeted at particular groups (e.g. policy-makers) and the general public will be undertaken (workshops, conferences, media, etc)     The main       activities      will consist of research work on:      growth, employment and competitiveness issues;       possible trade-offs and synergies between economic, social and environmental objectives in the world context;       sustainable development;       major trends in society and their implications;       Europe in the world;       citizens in the European Union;       use of socio-economic and scientific indicators in the implementation of policies;       early identification of long-term challenges and areas of common interest.      The budget allocated to this theme will be EUR 623 million.      Security and space      There are numerous       objectives      in these two areas;      to develop technologies and knowledge focusing on civil applications to ensure the security of citizens against threats (e.g. terrorism, crime, natural disasters and industrial accidents);       to ensure optimum and concerted use of available and evolving technologies for the benefit of European security while respecting         fundamental human rights        ;       to stimulate cooperation between providers and users in security solutions;       to reinforce the technology base of the European security industry and strengthen its competitiveness;       to support a European space programme focusing on applications such as the         GMES        for the benefit of citizens and for the competitiveness of the European space industry.      Where security is concerned,       priority      will be given to the civil dimension. The research will be multidisciplinary. It will be based on a two-fold approach: methodology development and technology integration, demonstration and validation. The       activities      will address four security mission areas in which there is a European added value (protection against terrorism and crime, security of infrastructures and utilities, border security, and restoring security in a crisis) and three cross-cutting areas (security systems integration and interoperability, security and society, and security research coordination and structuring).     Where       space      is concerned, the aim is to place satellite technologies at the service of European society (security, environment, and communications) and support space exploration activities.     The budgets allocated in the domains of space and security will be, respectively, EUR 1 430 and 1 400 million.      Background      Since 1984, the EU has been pursuing a research and technological development policy based on multiannual framework programmes. The Seventh Framework Programme is the second since the launching of the       Lisbon strategy      in 2000 and is intended to play a vital role in relation to growth and employment in Europe over the next few years. The Commission wishes to develop the "knowledge triangle" formed by research, education and innovation policies to place knowledge at the service of economic dynamism and social and environmental progress.

act   Council  Regulation (EU) No 558/2014  of 6 May 2014 establishing the Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking.   summary   The CS 2 JU aims to improve the environmental performance of aircraft by ensuring they are cleaner, more fuel-efficient and less noisy, as well as by helping to develop a strong and competitive aeronautics industry in Europe.  Regulation (EU) No 558/2014 covers the period until 2024. This new phase continues where the original programme left off. It involves companies, universities, public laboratories, innovative SMEs and the European Commission.  CS 2’s  targets  are:        —     increasing aircraft fuel efficiency to reduce CO  2  emissions by between 20 to 30 percent; and            —     reducing aircraft nitrogen oxide (NO  x  ) and noise emissions by between 20 to 30 percent compared to the most modern aircraft entering into service as from 2014.      CS 2 comprises:        1.     Three innovative aircraft demonstrator platforms (IADPs) for large passenger aircraft, regional aircraft and fast rotorcraft (advanced helicopters), developing and testing flying demonstrators at the full aircraft/vehicle level;            2.     Three integrated technology demonstrators (ITDs), looking at airframe, engines and systems, using demonstrators at major integrated system level;            3.     Two transverse activities (small air transport, eco-design), integrating the knowledge of different ITDs and IADPs for specific applications and enabling synergies to be exploited between different platforms through shared projects and results;            4.     The technology evaluator (TE), monitoring and assessing the environmental and societal impact of the technologies developed in the IADPs and ITDs.       Management   The CS 2 JU is a legal entity set up for the purpose under Article 187 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (which allows for PPPs at EU level in the field of industrial research). The JU sets its own strategic research agenda and funds members’ projects, as well as projects selected following calls for proposals published on  CS 2 JU’s  website. As a general rule, the JU applies the Horizon 2020 rules for participation.  CS 2 is managed by an  Executive Director  who is supported by the Clean Sky team. The JU has a  governing board  comprising the industry, research organisations and European Commission representatives. It has overall responsibility for the operations of the JU. It is advised by scientific committees on scientific priorities. There is also a CS 2 states representatives group representing the countries involved, as well as steering committees for the ITDs and IADPs. Decisions are taken in accordance with the voting rules established by the JU.  Article 209 of the  EU’s Financial Regulation  (Regulation (EU, Euratom) No  966/2012  ) provides for new lighter rules customised for EU PPP bodies.   Budget   CS 2’s overall budget is  EUR 4 billion  . EUR 1.8 billion comes from the  Horizon 2020  programme budget. Industrial partners contribute EUR 2.2 billion, EUR 1 billion of which comes through additional activities not included in the work plan of the JTI but that help meet its objectives. In order to take into account the duration of the Horizon 2020 programme, calls for proposals under CS 2 JU must be launched by 31 December 2020:        —     40 % of the budget is reserved for the CS 2 founding members who lead the technical programme and commit for the whole of its duration;            —     30 % is allocated to core partners selected through open calls at the start of the programme, which become full members of the JU;            —     the last 30 % of funding is distributed in annual open calls to support the specific tasks.      The JU also seeks to develop synergies with the  European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF)  .

   Enhancing the patent system in Europe     Enhancing the patent system in Europe     Protecting intellectual property promotes innovation and strengthens the European Union's competitiveness. Patents can play a central role here, but substantial reforms are needed at European level. Making a Community patent system a reality and improving the current procedures for resolving disputes should, together with supporting measures, make the patent system more accessible and lead to savings for all involved.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council of 3 April 2007 - Enhancing the patent system in Europe [       COM(2007) 165      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The communication points out that the current European patent system is considerably more expensive than the US and Japanese systems. A Community system would be much more attractive than the present system of European patents, which is simply a bundle of national patents. A European patent designating 13 countries is 11 times more expensive than a US patent and 13 times more expensive then a Japanese patent. The existing system for resolving disputes in the EU, with the risk of multiple litigation in a number of Member States on the same patent issue, involves the parties concerned in unnecessary costs and creates a lack of legal certainty.     In view of the difficulties being experienced in the area of patents and, in particular, in creating a Community patent, in 2006 the Commission launched a broad consultation, involving all those concerned, on the future of patent policy in Europe. The results of the consultation leave no doubt as to the urgent need to create a simple, cost-effective and high quality patent system in Europe.     This communication aims to draw operational conclusions from the consultation and enable the Council to open discussions on the reform of the system of patents and, in particular, on the Community patent and jurisdictional arrangements. It also puts forward a number of supporting measures to improve the patent system, concerning patent quality, knowledge transfer and enforcement issues.      The Community patent      Many stakeholders continue to support the Community patent as the approach that will yield most added value for European industry under the Lisbon Strategy. However they criticise the Council's Common Political Approach adopted in 2003 on the grounds of the high costs of translation and the excessive centralisation of the proposed jurisdictional system.     The Commission believes that a truly competitive and attractive Community patent can be achieved provided there is political will to do so. Concerns about over-centralisation should be taken into account in the creation of the EU-wide patent jurisdiction system. On translation costs, the Commission will explore with the Member States ways of improving the language regime with a view to reducing costs while increasing legal certainty.      Jurisdictional system      Currently, any disputes arising from a European patent granted by the       European Patent Office      (EPO) can be brought before the national courts. This is because each European patent is a bundle of national patents, which are subject to the national rules of the EPO Contracting States designated in the application. In the absence of a single jurisdiction, disputes are dealt with in accordance with national laws and procedures.     This situation creates difficulties that damage legal certainty and impede business decisions on patented products:       multiple litigation        : the same issue can be brought before the courts in several countries, creating a difficult situation for competitors;        high costs        : the parties concerned have to pay court fees and hire lawyers and experts in all the countries in which action is brought;        inconsistencies        : courts deal with cases in accordance with national law, which can produce different and sometimes contradictory results;        choice of forum        : given the possibility of choosing which jurisdiction is to apply, parties tend to choose the one most likely to deal with the matter in a way that favours their interests.      The major advantage of a single jurisdiction for patents are the savings made by the parties involved in a dispute. The costs of disputes are currently excessive and vary considerably according to a number of factors, including the complexity of the case, technical aspects and the sums involved. These costs weigh most heavily on individual inventors and small businesses, which can be discouraged from taking out patents and, more generally, from investing in research and development.      Discussion of the new jurisdictional system      The Member States agree on the need for a Europe-wide patent court system that would guarantee cost-effectiveness, legal certainty and proximity to users. However, discussions have revealed differences about how to proceed.     Recent discussions with the Member States have brought to light different views on the jurisdictional system: some Member States support the       draft European Patent Litigation Agreement      (EPLA) in the context of the European Patent Convention, which aims to create a single jurisdiction for disputes concerning European patents, while others favour the creation of a specific Community jurisdiction based on the Treaty for litigation on European and Community patents.     Under these circumstances, the Commission believes that consensus could be built on the basis of an integrated approach that combines features of both EPLA and a Community jurisdiction. This could involve one single court system with competence for litigation on European patents and future Community patents. Such a judicial system could be based on the EPLA model and allow for harmonious integration into the Community jurisdiction. Initially, efforts should be concentrated on building consensus among Member States around these principles.     The jurisdiction would have competence for infringement and validity actions as well as for related claims such as damages. It should ensure an appropriate degree of proximity to the parties concerned and comprise a limited number of first instance chambers as well as a fully centralised appeal court that would ensure uniformity of interpretation. These chambers, which could make use of existing national structures, should form an integral part of the single jurisdictional system.     The first instance chambers and the appeal court should work under common rules of procedure based on best practices in the Member States.     The patent jurisdiction should have legally and technically qualified judges with full judicial independence.     Finally, the patent jurisdiction must respect the European Court of Justice as the final arbiter in matters of EU law, including questions relating to Community legislation and to the validity of future Community patents.      Supporting measures to improve the patent system      With a view to promoting a reliable patent system, the Commission proposes the following supporting measures:       guaranteeing patent quality        : rigorous patentability criteria must be applied to maintain the high quality of European patents. Cooperation between patent offices will reduce costs and delivery times;        supporting small businesses        : small businesses must be given all necessary advice on patents. The Commission is providing backing for support projects under the         PRO INNO Europe initiative        and the         Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme        ;        improving technology and knowledge transfer        : between European businesses on the one hand and between research centres and businesses on the other;        enforcing patent rights        : the legal framework for patents must be strengthened, taking account of the different ways of resolving disputes, including alternative dispute resolution systems, patent litigation insurance and international standards.       Background      The promotion of intellectual property rights (IPRs) and, in particular, patents is part of the       Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs      , in that it stresses the role of patents as a driving force for European development.     A separate, detailed communication on intellectual property rights is planned for 2008. This will supplement this communication and cover the main non-legislative and horizontal questions relating to all aspects of intellectual property.     Last updated: 22.06.2007  
   Ground handling at Community airports     Ground handling at Community airports     SUMMARY OF:      Directive 96/67/EC on access to the groundhandling market at Community airports      WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?     The ground-handling       *      services at European Union (       EU      ) airports where access is being granted include those that enable airlines to carry out air-transport activities (taxi guidance, cleaning, refuelling, baggage services, etc.).     The directive applies to all EU airports open to commercial traffic whose annual traffic is not less than 2 million passenger movements or 50,000 tonnes of cargo.     KEY POINTS     The managing body of an airport       *      , the airport user       *      or the supplier of ground-handling services       *      must, under the supervision of the designated auditor, rigorously separate the accounts of their ground-handling activities from the accounts of their other activities.     In parallel, the EU country:      must set up, for each of the airports concerned, a         committee of representatives        of airport users to represent users’ interests;       may require that suppliers of ground-handling services be established within the EU and may         limit the number of suppliers authorised        to provide categories of ground-handling services such as baggage handling, ramp handling, fuel and oil handling, cargo and mail handling;       may         reduce to two the number of users        able to provide self-handling for ground-handling services such as baggage handling, ramp handling, fuel and oil handling, cargo and mail handling;       may         benefit from exemptions        (limited in time) where at an airport specific constraints of available space or capacity make it impossible to open up the market and/or implement self-handling;       may under certain conditions         reserve for one body the management of the centralised infrastructures        which cannot be divided up or the cost of which does not allow for duplication. In parallel, subject to certain conditions, EU countries may grant exemptions to airports where specific constraints make it impossible to open up the market and/or implement self-handling to the degree provided for in the directive;       may oblige the supplier chosen at an airport to also         operate on islands        that are part of the territory of the EU country;       may subject the activity of suppliers of ground-handling services to the         requirement to obtain a licence        issued by a public authority that is independent of the airport in order to guarantee safety, security, environmental protection and compliance with social legislation;       must take the necessary measures to ensure that suppliers of ground-handling services and airport users wishing to self-handle have         access to airport installations        – where access to these installations is subject to a fee, the fee shall be determined according to relevant, objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria;       may adopt, subject to the other provisions of EU law, the necessary measures to ensure the         protection of workers’ rights        and         respect for the environment        .      FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?     It has applied since 14 November 1996 and had to become law in the EU countries by 25 October 1997.     BACKGROUND     This directive provided for a gradual implementation schedule according to whether self-handling services or third-party handling services were involved. From 1 January 2001, the directive applies to any airport located on the territory of a EU country at which the annual traffic is not less than 2 million passenger movements or 50,000 tonnes of cargo.     For more information, see:       Groundhandling        (         European Commission        )      KEY TERMS      Ground-handling:      covers a wide variety of services required by airlines in order to operate flights. These services include areas such as maintenance, fuel and freight handling. Ground-handling also covers services like passenger check-in, catering, baggage handling and transport within the airport itself.      Managing body of the airport:      the body responsible for administrating and managing airport infrastructures and supervising and coordinating the activities carried out by different operators.      Airport user:      natural or legal person carrying passengers, mail or cargo by air.      Supplier of ground-handling services:      natural or legal person providing third parties with one or more categories of ground-handling services.     MAIN DOCUMENT     Council Directive       96/67/EC      of 15 October 1996 on access to the groundhandling market at Community airports (OJ L 272, 25.10.1996, pp. 36-45)     Successive amendments to Council Directive 96/67/EC have been incorporated in the original text.

   Towards a strategy for soil protection     Towards a strategy for soil protection     1) OBJECTIVE     To formulate a plan with a view to developing a Community strategy for soil protection.     2) ACT     Communication of 16 April 2002 from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - Towards a Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection [       COM (2002) 179      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     3) SUMMARY     One of the objectives of the       Sixth Environmental Action Programme      is to protect soils against erosion and pollution. It is to fulfil this objective that the Commission is publishing this Communication, which paves the way for developing a strategy on soil protection. For the purpose of this Communication, soil is defined as the top layer of the earth's crust, formed by mineral particles, organic matter, water, air and living organisms.     This Communication describes the functions of soil, which include:      producing food,       storing, filtering and transforming minerals, water, organic matter, gases, etc.,       providing raw materials,       being the platform for human activity.      The Communication also identifies the main threats to soil in Europe: erosion, decline in organic matter, soil contamination, soil sealing (caused by the covering of soil for housing, roads and other infrastructure), soil compaction (caused by mechanical pressure through the use of heavy machinery, overgrazing or sporting activities), decline in soil biodiversity, salinisation (excessive accumulation of soluble salts of sodium, magnesium and calcium) and floods and landslides. All these processes are either driven or exacerbated by human activity and some degradation processes have increased over recent decades. The economic consequences and restoration costs linked to the threats to soil are huge.     The Communication examines the international initiatives taken to address soil degradation, as well as action undertaken by EU Member States and Candidate Countries. As regards Community initiatives as such, the Communication stresses that an explicit Community policy does not exist at this stage. However, measures implemented under other policies (environmental, agricultural, regional, transport, research) contribute to soil protection.      Building blocks of a thematic strategy      It is therefore essential that the EU develop a Community thematic strategy for soil. This strategy will be presented in 2004. It will take into consideration the       principles of precaution      , anticipation and       environmental responsibility      , and will focus on initiatives already being undertaken in environmental policies, better integration of soil protection in other policies, soil monitoring and new actions based on monitoring results.     In environmental policy, new legislation will supplement existing legislation:      in 2002: 4th Daughter Directive on air quality and a directive on mining waste;       in 2003: revision of the         Sewage Sludge Directive        and Communication on Planning and Environment, focusing on sustainable use of soil;       by the end of 2004: directive on compost and other biowaste.      The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) will encourage organic farming, the maintenance of terraces, safer pesticide use, use of certified compost, forestry, afforestation and other measures for soil protection. Under the review of the CAP, the Commission intends to expand the financial commitment to rural development and soil protection.     As regards soil monitoring, the Commission will propose, by June 2004, legislation on a Community information and monitoring system for soil threats. This monitoring will provide the basis for future legislative initiatives and will be used as a tool to adjust and review existing policies in the field of soil protection.      4) implementing measures       5) follow-up work      Last updated: 30.04.2002  
   National regional investment aid     National regional investment aid     This Regulation lays down the conditions for exemption from the notification to the Commission of aid awarded under regional investment aid schemes, which are compatible with the internal market.     ACT     Commission Regulation (EC) No       1628/2006      of 24 October 2006 on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty to national regional investment aid.     SUMMARY     This regulation regards transparent regional investment aid schemes       *      , which constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty and are compatible with the internal marketwithin the meaning of Article 87(3) of the EC Treaty. It lays down the conditions for exemption from the notification of aid awarded under these schemes by the Member States (notification requirement of Article 88(3) of the EC Treaty).      Conditions for exemption      Aid for initial investment is compatible with the common market provided that:      it is granted in regions eligible for regional aid, as determined in the regional aid map for the Member State concerned for the period 2007-2013;       the aid intensity in present gross grant equivalent does not exceed the regional aid ceiling which is in force, as determined in the regional aid map for the Member State concerned for the period 2007-2013.      The following are compatible with the internal market and are not subject to prior notification to the Commission:      transparent regional investment aid schemes         *        which constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the Treaty and meet the conditions laid down in this Regulation;       individual aid that is not awarded on the basis of an aid scheme ('ad hoc' aid) which does not exceed 50 % of the total aid to be granted for the investment.       Scope      This Regulation does not apply to:      the         fisheries        and aquaculture sector;       the         shipbuilding        sector;       the coal industry;       the steel industry;       the synthetic fibres sector;       the         production of agricultural products        listed in Annex I to the EC Treaty;       aid for activities related to export towards third countries or Member States;       aid contingent upon the use of domestic over imported goods.       Notification requirement      Aid which is not exempted from notification under this Regulation remains subject to prior notification to the Commission. This includes among others:      non transparent aid;       operating aid;       regional schemes targeting specific sectors of economic activity within manufacturing or services;       regional aid awarded for large investment projects on the basis of existing aid schemes (if the total amount of aid from all sources exceeds 75 % of the maximum amount of aid an investment with eligible expenditure of EUR 100 million could receive, applying the standard aid ceiling in force for large undertakings in the regional aid map on the date the aid is to be granted).        Key terms in the Act         Transparent regional investment aid schemes: regional investment aid schemes in which it is possible to calculate precisely the gross grant equivalent as a percentage of eligible expenditure ex ante without the need to undertake a risk assessment (for example, schemes which use grants, interest rate subsidies, or capped fiscal measures). Schemes which use public loans are considered as transparent regional investment aid schemes if they are backed by normal security and do not involve abnormal risk, and are therefore not considered to contain a State guarantee element.         Initial investment: an investment in tangible and intangible assets relating to the setting-up of a new establishment, the extension of an existing establishment, diversification of the output of an establishment into new additional products, a fundamental change in the overall production process of an existing establishment or the acquisition of the capital assets directly linked to an establishment, where the establishment has closed or would have closed had it not been purchased, and the assets are bought by an independent investor.

   Promoting sustainable transport     Promoting sustainable transport     1) OBJECTIVE     To develop a strategy to ensure sustainable transport in developing countries, in other words transport which is safe, economically, financially and institutionally sustainable as well as environmentally sound and socially aware.     2) ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and to the European Parliament of 6 July 2000 - Promoting sustainable transport in development cooperation [       COM(2000) 422      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     3) SUMMARY      Background      Access to reliable, affordable and secure transport is an important factor for development. By ensuring access to the key areas of development such as employment, health care and education, transport contributes for the most part to economic and social development, integration into the world economy and the fight against poverty (one of the Community's main objectives).     In this respect, the development of sustainable transport has been identified as one of the priority areas of the       European Community's strategy      on development aid.     The Community's activities relate, in particular, to the ACP countries, for which this sector has been an important area of cooperation since 1963.     This communication is closely linked to the       guidelines      , drawn up in 1996, establishing a sectoral approach in this area.      Guiding principles      The communication looks at all the aspects of transport systems (infrastructures, legal framework, etc.) from a sectoral point of view.     The principles guiding the development of sustainable transport are divided into four categories, namely:       common development principles        These include involving all of the parties in the development of strategies, marketing and the privatisation of certain forms of transport (urban public transport, for example), minimising the impact on the environment, transport safety and equal access to meet the different needs of women and men;        principles for fostering sustainable economic and social development        These principles include ensuring that transport has a right and proper share of national budgets, giving greater priority to funding existing transport systems, optimising and integrating existing transport facilities and public-private partnerships, as well as strengthening government skills to ensure effective regulation;        principles for integrating the developing countries into the world economy        This involves, in particular, ensuring that the countries make the most of international trade by guaranteeing free movement of transit traffic through the simplification of national regulations and documentation, reducing transport journey times by simplifying procedures and implementing international agreements, and using new technologies to help keep pace with changes in the world economy;        principles for contributing to the fight against poverty        Consideration must be given to the different needs of rural and urban areas, by facilitating non-motorised transport in rural areas for example. Employing small local contractors to carry out the work is also an important way of contributing to a long-term increase in employment.       Strategy      Following this approach, the strategy should envisage transport which is economically, financially and institutionally sustainable, as well as environmentally sound, safe and socially aware. Thus, the global strategy is composed of five main areas, namely:       a strategy for economic balance        The actions implemented should aim to draw up a medium-term budget strategy for financing transport, taking account of budget constraints and ensuring that this sector receives an adequate budget in relation to the other fields. Since privatisation will become more and more important, it is essential to ensure fair competition by examining, in particular, tariffs and prices. Efforts must also be made to target subsidies better in order to prevent wasting resources;        a strategy for financial sustainability        This involves ensuring efficient use of resources, which should be facilitated by, inter alia, a more commercial approach and the privatisation of certain sectors. First of all, the railways must focus on core rail business and contract out to the private sector additional services such as catering. Maritime and inland ports, airports and air traffic services must also use private operators. It is important to secure sufficient revenue for road maintenance. Consideration must be given to the characteristics of these countries, in other words, given the low traffic volumes on certain roads, it may be more appropriate to look at methods other than tolls (levy on fuel, for instance);        a strategy for commercially        -         minded institutional reform        Regulation must remain in the government domain. This said, there must be a reform of the public sector to clarify responsibilities and tasks. It would also be useful to adopt a more commercial approach to management. This means making the forms of transport more competitive by commercialising management of the railways and roads (through public-private partnerships, for example), privatising road management and maintenance and granting autonomy to port and airport authorities;        an environmentally sound strategy        Reducing the causes of pollution is an important aspect of this strategy. To this end, efforts must be made to update regulations and improve monitoring and to reduce vehicle emissions by enforcing minimum standards and improving regular testing. The promotion of non-motorised transport may also contribute to this goal. Easing congestion in urban areas is another important factor, which may involve simple measures such as priority bus lanes and parking restrictions. An additional measure is to make the polluter pay. Levying charges on vehicle emissions is a medium-term objective. In the short term, fuel taxation may be introduced. Aircraft fleets should be modernised to reduce noise pollution;        a safety conscious and socially aware strategy        This involves, in particular, ensuring a high level of safety, encouraging the use of intermediate transport and improving job prospects. For this purpose, efforts should be made to improve the safety of road and rail networks by making the public aware of the dangers and the rules and by applying these rules more effectively. As far as the air and maritime sectors are concerned, respect of international standards is vital. Greater participation of the private sector offers an important opportunity to create jobs for the population, which is of particular importance given the diminishing role of the public sector. The greatest need is among the semi-skilled and unskilled labour force. Technical assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises is important to provide training on key topics such as labour standards.       Implementation      The strategy would be implemented on three levels: national, regional and in coordination with other actors at international level.     Community support is broadly structured by the regional and national indicative programmes drawn up by the Commission and the beneficiary country in question. At regional level, the Community can play a crucial role by providing support for regional transport corridors.     It is also essential to coordinate the activities of the Community, not only with those of the Member States but also those of other international actors such as the OECD.     The effective implementation of the strategy depends first and foremost on the political commitment of the governments of the beneficiary countries. The Commission considers this commitment to be a necessary prerequisite.      4) implementing measures       5) follow-up work      Last updated: 01.08.2005  
   EU strategy for biofuels     EU strategy for biofuels     The European Union (EU) sets out seven strategic policy areas for the development of the production and use of biofuels by the Member States and developing countries.     ACT     Commission Communication of 8 February 2006 entitled "An EU Strategy for Biofuels" [       COM(2006) 34      final - Official Journal C 67 of 18 March 2006].     SUMMARY     In its Strategy, the Commission defines the role that biofuels       *      produced from biomass, a renewable resource, may play in the future as a source of renewable energy serving as an alternative to the fossil fuel energy sources (chiefly oil) used in the transport sector. It also proposes measures to promote the production and use of biofuels.     The Strategy complements the Biomass Action Plan       *      adopted at the end of 2005 and responds to a threefold objective: further promotion of biofuels in the EU and in developing countries, preparation for the large-scale use of biofuels, and heightened cooperation with developing countries in the sustainable production of biofuels. This threefold objective breaks down into seven policy areas, which encompass the priorities envisaged by the Commission.     Among the measures intended to       stimulate demand for biofuels      , the Commission intends to bring forward a report on the implementation of the Biofuels Directive and the possible revision of the Directive, stressing the importance of national targets, biofuel use obligations and ensuring sustainable production of biofuels. The Commission will also pay particular attention to the tax benefits included in the 2003 Energy Taxation Directive and the possible establishment of a regulatory framework for incentives linked to the environmental performance of individual fuels. It will continue to encourage the use of biofuels in public and private vehicle fleets. To this end, at the end of 2005 it proposed a Directive on the promotion of clean vehicles for use in road transport.     Among measures intended for       ensuring environmental benefits      , the Commission intends to highlight the advantages of biofuels in terms of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases (and in particular to link these advantages to the promotion of biofuels). In addition, it is essential to guarantee that feedstock for biofuels is produced in a sustainable manner, both in the EU and in third countries, particularly with regard to the protection of biodiversity, water pollution, soil degradation and the protection of habitats and species. Another important element that should be taken into consideration is the compatibility of technical and environmental regulations, particularly with regard to maximum quantities of biofuels in petrol and diesel.     With a view to       developing the production and distribution of biofuels      , the Member States and regions are invited to consider the opportunities offered by biofuels in terms of economic activity and job creation within the context of the cohesion policy and rural development policy. The Commission has already proposed guidelines in this respect and intends to set up an ad hoc reflection group. The Commission will ask the relevant industries to justify their use of practices that act as barriers to the introduction of biofuels and will monitor the behaviour of these industries to ensure that there is no discrimination against biofuels.     In order to ensure sustainable production of biofuels, the Commission intends to       expand feedstock supplies      . One of the measures it intends to implement is to include sugar production for the manufacture of bioethanol       *      in CAP aid schemes. In addition, it will study the possibility of processing cereals from existing intervention stocks into biofuels, finance a campaign to inform farmers and forest operators, bring forward a Forestry Action Plan and examine the possibility of using animal by-products and waste as energy sources.     In order to       enhance the trade opportunities of biofuels      , the Commission will study the possibility of establishing separate customs codes for biofuels. It also intends to pursue a balanced approach to trade negotiations with ethanol-producing countries in order to ensure sustainable development of European production and imports of biofuels, and to submit an amendment to the standard for biodiesel       *      .     The Commission also wants to       support developing countries      with potential in terms of biofuels, particularly by means of accompanying measures for countries affected by EU       sugar reform      , a specific aid programme for biofuels, and a framework for effective cooperation that would include among other things the development of national biofuel platforms and regional biofuel action plans.     Lastly, it is essential that the Commission continue to       support research and innovation      , particularly in order to improve production processes and to lower costs. The principal measures will focus on,       inter alia      , continuing with activities in the field of research and development via the       Seventh Framework Programme      for Research and Development, the full use of second generation biomass and biofuels (i.e. originating from the processing of ligno-cellulosic feedstock such as straw and forest residues). The development of industry-led European technology platforms such as the European Biofuels Technology Platform, should make it possible to establish a shared European vision and strategy for the production and use of biofuels.      Background      The two main reasons for research into renewable energy sources as an alternative to oil are:      the significant contribution of transport to emissions of greenhouse gases. Emissions resulting from transport account for 21% of the total emissions of greenhouse gases. As a result, it is necessary to use fuels that are less polluting than oil;       the need to guarantee the security of energy supplies by diversifying fuel sources. The limited quantity of available oil and the increase in prices of fossil fuels represent increasingly urgent challenges for the transport sector and for national economies.        Key terms used in the act         Biofuel: liquid or gaseous fuel used for transport produced from biomass.         Biomass: the totality of organic animal or vegetable matter. This includes in particular the biodegradable fraction of products, wastes and residues from agriculture, forestry, industry and households.         Biodiesel: a methyl-ester produced from vegetable or animal oil, of diesel quality, to be used as biofuel.         Bioethanol: ethanol production from the fermentation of plants rich in sugar/starch, to be used as biofuel.

Commission Report of 10 January 2007 on biofuels - Report on the progress made by EU Member States in terms of biofuels and other renewable fuels [         COM(2006) 845        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      In 2005, biofuels were used in 17 of the 21 Member States for which data were available. The Commission indicates a significant increase in market share, reaching 1% on average (it has doubled in two years). Nonetheless, this figure is below the reference value fixed at 2%. In addition, the advances have been very varied: only Germany (3.8%) and Sweden (2.2%) achieved the reference value. While biodiesel achieved a share of about 1.6% of the diesel market, ethanol achieved a share of only 0.4% of the petrol market. On the basis of different projections, the Commission considers it unlikely that Member States will achieve the 5.75% target set by the Biofuels Directive for 2010. It considers that this Directive needs to be amended, in particular by setting a mandatory target of 10% for 2010 for the EU as a whole and by promoting high-quality biofuels. The report also contains an account of the economic and environmental impact linked to the promotion of biofuels.

   Women's health     Women's health     This report provides an overview of the health of women in the European Community, highlighting both differences and similarities within and between the Member States.     ACT     Commission Report of 22 May 1997 on the state of women's health in the European Community [       COM(97) 224      final - Not published in the Official Journal]     SUMMARY     The report examines the main causes of mortality and morbidity as well as a number of individual and social determinants which influence women's health within the context of evolving demographic and social trends.     The main sources of data are:      the World Health Organisation's "Health for All" database;       various reports and data from EUROSTAT;       an EC-wide Eurobarometer survey carried out in early 1996.      The data obtained are somewhat limited in their comprehensiveness and comparability. These constraints narrow the range of subjects dealt with in the report.     The report focuses on women aged 15 years and older, because most gender-specific health data at EC level concentrate on this age-group.      Social and demographic trends      Women account for 51.2% of the population of the European Community. This percentage is very stable across the Member States, varying from a 50.4% in Ireland to 51.8% in Portugal.     There is considerable variation in the percentage of women across age-groups: in the group of women under 20 years of age, there are 95 women for every 100 men, while among 80-year-olds there are about 221 women for every 100 men. This degree of variation can be partly explained by the difference in life expectancy, with that of women having significantly increased to reach 80 years old, six years more than the average expectancy for men.     There have been considerable changes in family life. The rate of marriage has declined significantly, from 8 to 5.1 marriages for every 1 000 persons in the period from 1960 to 1995. At the same time, the rate of divorce has more than tripled, from 0.54 to 1.8 for every 1 000 persons (except in Ireland). The average age of first marriage and the age at first birth have risen to 26.1 and 28.6 years respectively.     Women's labour force participation has increased tremendously, although there are very considerable variations across the Member States, ranging from 70% in the Nordic countries (where there exists the greater equality between sexes) to 40% in southern Europe. Concomitant with this trend has been an increase in part-time work (between 70% and 90% of part-time jobs are done by women) and temporary employment. Women are affected more than men by unemployment.      Selected health indicators      Infant mortality has fallen sharply in the Community; only 6.9 baby girls out of 1 000 live births die before the age of 1 year, which represents a decline of 68% since 1970. Maternal mortality rates have also declined significantly (by 79% since 1970) to 7 deaths per 100 000 women in 1992.     62% of women in the Community consider themselves to be in good or very good health, although this figure obscures very considerable variations between Member States, ranging from 75.8% in Ireland to 34.7% in Portugal.     The average height of women has increased over the last few decades, and is now 163.5 cm. Dutch women average a height of 167.9 cm, while Portuguese women average 159.6 cm.      Morbidity      Since there are no disease-specific morbidity measures at Community level, indirect measures such as short- and long-term disability and health care utilisation have been used.     On average, almost one out of every four women report limitations in their daily activities to some extent (17.3%) or severely (6.3%) because of long-standing illness. This average varies from a high of 30% in Finland and Portugal to a low of 15% in Luxembourg, and increases with age.     The rate of temporary activity limitation is fairly low in absolute terms, although 14% of women report having had to cut down on their activities in the past two weeks because of illness or injury. The lowest rate is in Italy (5.6%) and the highest in the Netherlands (20%).     On average, one out of three women has consulted with a physician in person or by telephone in the past two weeks (ranging from 25% in Ireland and the Netherlands to 38% in Spain). An average of 10% of women in the Community report having had one or more (non-birth) hospitalisations in the past year, staying a total of about 10 days in the hospital. There is a considerable variation in this figure between Denmark (3.8%) and France and Finland (13%). Older women are twice as likely as younger women to have been hospitalised, and they tend to stay longer as well.      Causes of death and trends in female mortality      Across all ages, the most frequent causes of death among women are diseases of the circulatory system (accounting for 43% of all deaths), cancer (26%), diseases of the respiratory system (6%) and suicide and accidents (5%).     The major causes of death vary with age:      for women under 30, motor vehicle accidents are the main cause of death;       in the 30-34 age-group, the main cause is suicide;       for women aged 35-64, the main cause of death is cancer, particularly breast and cervical cancer;       for women aged 65 and over, diseases of the circulatory system account for almost half of all deaths.       Health determinants and health promotion      To a very large extent, the two major causes of mortality (heart disease and cancer) are preventable through primary (healthier lifestyles) or secondary prevention (early detection through, for example, screening). The main risk factors associated with much premature mortality (death before the age of 65) include smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet and lack of exercise.     In most Member States, about 25% of women smoke, and this figure is increasing continually. Denmark and Portugal stand out because of their respectively very high (42%) and very low rates (12%) of smoking among women. Smoking is the main risk factor in about 30% of cancers and is a major factor in cardiovascular diseases.     There are no data available on average alcohol consumption among women. However, it is known that women drink less than men, although this gap between the sexes is gradually getting smaller. Immoderate consumption increases the risk of liver complaints, diseases of the circulatory system and certain types of cancer.     Even though data on diet are scarce, analyses can draw on data on the outcome of eating patterns, i.e. weight. In the Community, one out of every five women is overweight as measured by the body mass index (BMI), while 15% are underweight. The highest incidences of excess weight are in Greece (33.2%) and Portugal (28.5%), and the lowest in France (15.5%) and Denmark (16.6%). Being overweight is a significant risk factor for heart disease, diabetes and cancer.     The frequency and types of health check-ups for women vary considerably by age-group and by country. For example, 44% of women aged 65 or over have had a heart check-up in the past year, compared with only 10% among women aged under 35. In Germany, 35.3% of women have had a heart check-up, whilst the figure for the Netherlands is 9.7%.     As regards diabetes, around 22% of women have had a diabetes test in the past year, although the figure is 44% among overweight women aged 40 and over. There is considerable variation between Member States: Germany reports the highest rate of testing (35.3%), with the lowest rates being reported in the Netherlands and Sweden (9.7% and 12.8% respectively).     Around 16% of women in the Community report having had an osteoporosis test in the past year. The rate of testing ranges from 4% in Finland to 28% in Austria.     Thanks to the various programmes at national and Community level, the rate of cancer screening is very high. Almost 40% of women report having had a cervical smear in the previous year, although the figure varies considerably between Member States, from 15.8% in Ireland to 63.5% in Denmark.     Similarly, almost 40% of women report having performed a breast self-examination in the previous year, and 18% report having had a mammography during the same period. Some Member States have introduced systematic screening programmes which have had a significant impact on the cancer mortality rate. Moreover, 90% of women endorsed free mammography screening.      Special issues in women's health      Several health issues have emerged over the past few years because of their particular importance for women:     - There is a lack of data on the incidence and prevalence of       eating disorders      (bulimia and anorexia nervosa), although the perception is that it has been increasing throughout the Community over the last 20 years. One study puts the mortality rate among anorexia suffers at 6% (suicide, heart attack) and at 3% for those with bulimia.     - At the end of 1996, women accounted for 17% of       AIDS      sufferers, and this percentage was on the increase. Most of these women were intravenous drug users. The main transmission routes of HIV among women vary between Member States: intravenous drug use in Spain, Italy, Portugal, Ireland and heterosexual transmission in Belgium. Men are more likely to transmit HIV to women than vice versa. Preventive interventions aimed at women have in general been limited.     -       Availability of contraceptives and abortion      are important issues for women of reproductive age. Most Member States report contraceptive use rates between 71% and 81%, except for Spain (59%) and Portugal (66%). The most widely used method of contraception is the birth control pill, followed by the condom. The choice of contraceptive method is influenced by a variety of factors, particularly health risks and the side-effects associated with a particular method, as well as the age of the woman (younger women favour the use of birth control pills or condoms, while older women may prefer IUDs or surgical sterilisation). Abortion is permitted, under varying criteria/conditions, in all Member States except Ireland and Northern Ireland. Abortion rates per 1 000 women vary from one Member State to another, ranging from 18.3 in Sweden to 5.4 in Spain.     - the average age at       menopause      is 50-52 years. Its effects on women's health vary: 75% of menopausal women experience some problems or discomfort, but only 10-20% seek medical help. The increasing longevity of women has intensified the debate about the possible long-term consequences of menopause. Although there is currently no proof of a causal link between post-menopausal hormone levels and health, morbidity statistics reveal increased incidence of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis in post-menopausal women. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is still surrounded by controversy; rates of HRT use are estimated at 2% in Italy and 56% in Finland. It should be noted that a large majority of women feel that they are not being properly informed about the advantages and cost of this treatment.     -       Violence against women      is gradually being recognised as a public health issue because of both the physical and psychological harm it causes. Although data are scarce, it is now recognised that violence against women by a male partner is the most endemic form of violence. It is estimated that between one woman in three (Portugal and Germany) and one woman in five (Ireland) are victims of domestic violence.     In overall terms, the conclusion may be drawn that women in Europe are in good health and feel quite healthy. However, the report emphasises the improvements needed as regards preventive measures and the provision of information, and also the need to recognise that some health problems are specific to women.

   Action plan for an integrated maritime policy     Action plan for an integrated maritime policy     In order to protect maritime resources, the European Commission plans to put in place an integrated, horizontal and cross-sector maritime policy, encompassing all aspects of our relationship with the seas and oceans. The management framework, the objectives and the instruments proposed by the Commission are developed in this Communication which is founded on the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 10 October 2007 on an Integrated Maritime Policy for the European Union [       COM(2007) 575      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The creation of an integrated maritime policy requires a precise management framework. The Commission has created a Maritime Policy task force to analyse the interactions between the sectoral policies and coordinate them. It has also requested help from the Agencies of the European Union (EU) with maritime-related functions to draw up new policies. In addition, the development of new maritime policies involves consultation of civil society and all stakeholders as well as comprehensive impact assessments.      Objectives      The prime objective of an integrated maritime policy for the EU is to maximise sustainable use of the oceans and seas while enabling growth of the maritime economy and coastal regions. In order to ensure the competitiveness, safety and security of the sector, the European Commission commits to:      creating a strategy to alleviate the consequences of climate change in coastal regions;       enhancing professional qualifications and studies in the maritime field to offer better career prospects in the sector;       creating a European maritime space without administrative or customs barriers as well as a comprehensive maritime transport strategy for 2008-18 to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of maritime transport in Europe;       issuing guidelines on the application of environmental legislation relevant to ports and proposing a new ports policy taking account of the multiple roles of ports;       encouraging the formation of multi-sector clusters and promoting technological innovation in the shipbuilding and energy sector to ensure economic competitiveness without harming the environment;       supporting international efforts to reduce pollution of the atmosphere and greenhouse gas emissions attributable to ships;       taking steps against discharges into the sea, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and any other destructive practices.      A second key objective is building a knowledge and innovation base for the maritime policy. Marine science, technology and research enable analysis of the effects of human activity on marine systems and put forward solutions to alleviate environmental degradation and the effects of climate change. The European Commission plans to:      present a comprehensive European strategy for marine and maritime research;       improve understanding of maritime affairs for the         7th framework programme        ;       support the creation of a European marine science partnership with the aim of establishing dialogue between the scientific community, the industry and policy makers.      An integrated policy also has the objective of delivering a higher quality of life in coastal and outermost regions, reconciled with economic development and environmental sustainability. The Commission therefore aims in particular to:      encourage coastal tourism;       prepare a database on Community funding for maritime projects and coastal regions;       create a Community disaster prevention strategy in these regions;       develop the maritime potential of outermost regions and islands.      The EU intends, moreover, to promote its leading position in international maritime affairs. An integrated policy enables improved management of maritime affairs and the creation of EU priorities in this field. This is of particular importance given the global character of the problems encountered by the maritime sector. Therefore, the Commission will encourage:      cooperation in maritime affairs under the European Enlargement Policy, the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Northern Dimension and structured dialogue with major partners. The application of international agreements by partners is essential;       the Member States to ratify and apply the relevant instruments.      The final objective of this integrated policy is raising the visibility of Maritime Europe and improving the image of this sector's activities and professions. To this end, the Commission proposes positive actions and tools such as:      launch of educational tools (Atlas of the Seas) and instruments to highlight our common maritime heritage;       celebration of an annual European Maritime Day from 2008.       Instruments      Three instruments are of particular importance for creating common maritime policies:      a European network for maritime surveillance to ensure the safe use of the sea and the security of the EU's maritime borders, as these problems are transnational in nature. The Commission particularly encourages cooperation between coastguards and the relevant agencies, and undertakes to improve the interoperability of surveillance systems;       integrated coastal zone management (land and sea) to enable maritime spatial planning. While it is the Member States who have competence in this field, Europe-wide commitment is essential. The Commission will propose a roadmap in 2008 to facilitate the development of this instrument;       a complete and accessible source of data and information on natural and human activity on the oceans to facilitate strategic decision-making on maritime policy. Measures will be taken to establish a European Marine Observation and Data Network and to create multi-dimensional mapping of Member States' waters.       Background      The Communication follows on from the consultation launched in the       Green paper on a Maritime Policy for the EU      , by which the European Council of June asks the Commission to develop an action plan.     RELATED ACTS      Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 October 2010 establishing a Programme to support the further development of an Integrated Maritime Policy [         COM(2010) 494        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      This Proposal establishes a programme aimed at supporting the measures planned to further the development and implementation of the Integrated Maritime Policy. It is part of the continuation of preparatory actions and pilots projects to be launched between January 2011 and December 2013. The programme will provide financial resources for achieving the objectives and priorities set out in the action plan which was adopted in 2007.      Codecision procedure (         COD/2010/0257        )       Commission Communication of 8 October 2010 –         Marine Knowledge 2020: marine data and observation for smart and sustainable growth        [         COM(2010) 461        – Not published in the Official Journal].      This Communication details an action plan which makes up one of the three cross-cutting tools provided for by the EU’s Integrated Maritime Policy. This action plan is divided into three strands aimed at improving the reliability of marine data, making it more user-friendly and less expensive and stimulating competitiveness amongst the users of this data.      Commission Communication of 15 October 2009 -         Towards the integration of maritime surveillance: A common information sharing environment for the EU maritime domain        [         COM(2009) 538        – Not published in the Official Journal].      This Communication relates to the second cross-cutting tool provided for by the EU’s Integrated Maritime Policy. It sets out guiding principles for the development of a common information sharing environment for the EU maritime domain and launches the process towards its establishment. To achieve this, coordination and coherence between the European Commission, the Member States and interlocutors should be enhanced.      Communication from the Commission of 25 November 2008 – Roadmap for Maritime Spatial Planning: Achieving common principles in the EU [         COM(2008) 791        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      Maritime Spatial Planning is an instrument of the Integrated Maritime Policy which helps to improve coordination between the parties involved and optimises the use of the seas and oceans. This Communication defines a set of fundamental principles inspired by current practice and existing legislation. These principles will serve as the basis for the discussions leading to the drafting of a common approach concerning Maritime Spatial Planning.      Report from the Commission of 15 October 2009 - Progress report on the EU's integrated maritime policy [         COM(2009) 540        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      The Commission reviewed progress carried out under the framework of the Integrated Maritime Policy (IMP) since the adoption of the 2007 Communication and defined the       six strategic directions      for the future:       integration of maritime governance        : EU institutions, Member States and coastal regions shall establish effective structures for the purpose of cross-sectoral collaboration and consultation with stakeholders. These structures shall enable the potential of all the synergies between maritime-related sectoral policies to be used. As much as is possible, it should prevent sectoral policies from being isolated from each other.        development of cross-cutting policy tools        such as maritime spatial planning, exhaustive knowledge and databases on maritime spaces and integrated maritime surveillance. These tools can unlock considerable economic investments and improve the management of European maritime spaces.        definition of the boundaries for maritime activities        in order to ensure sustainability: in the context of the         Framework Directive "Strategy for the marine environment"        , these boundaries take into consideration the impact of the development of maritime activities on the seas and oceans.        sea-basin strategies        : these strategies contribute to the success of the IMP. They enable the priorities and tools of the policy to be adapted to the specific geographic, economic and political context of each large European sea-basin.        strengthening the international dimension        of integrated maritime policy: the EU must take a leading role in improving global maritime governance, as it has done in the matter of piracy or with regard to destructive fishing practices.        sustainable economic growth, employment and innovation        : the EU shall define overall, coherent economic priorities in order to promote the development of intra-EU maritime transport, stimulate investment, advance the concept of clean ships and promote energy generation from the sea, etc. It shall also ensure that maritime policy and coastal areas are fully taken into account in the debate on territorial cohesion.      The Commission shall publish a document on the implementation of these six strategic directions in 2010.     Last updated: 03.12.2010  
   Generalised System of Preferences 2006 - 2008     Generalised System of Preferences 2006 - 2008     This Regulation sets out the Generalised System of Preferences for the period from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2008. It simplifies the preferential import arrangements for products originating in developing countries, thereby streamlining the preferential scheme and reconciling trade and development objectives.     ACT     Council Regulation (EC) No       980/2005      of 27 June 2005 applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     This Regulation implements the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) for the period 2006 - 2008. The GSP sets out preferential arrangements for duties on Community imports of goods originating in the beneficiary countries.     The GSP therefore applies to the countries and territories listed in Annex I to the Regulation.     The products affected by the GSP are set out in Annex II. The arrangements for originating products conform to the rules set out in       Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93      . Regional cumulation is also possible, provided the regional groups are respected.     Products are divided into two categories: sensitive products, and non-sensitive products. Sensitivity is determined in relation to the effect that imports into the Community could have on Community products. Common Customs Tariff specific and       ad valorem      duties are fixed for such products. They are, however, suspended where the rate of an ad valorem duty reduced in accordance with the provisions of the GSP is 1 % or less and the rate of a specific duty is EUR 2 or less.     The GSP sets out three arrangements. Tariff preferences therefore differ according to the arrangement applicable to the beneficiary countries, namely:      the general arrangement;       the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance, which targets vulnerable countries;       the special arrangement for least developed countries.       General arrangement      The general arrangement sets out the general rules for the GSP. The principle for non-sensitive products is the complete suspension of the Common Customs Tariff duties applicable to such products, except for agricultural components.     For sensitive products, however, the Common Customs Tariff ad valorem duties applicable to the products are reduced by 3.5 %. This reduction is limited to 20 % for textiles and clothing. However, a tariff reduction of more than 3.5 % laid down by the GSP in the preceding 2002 to 2005 period (Regulation (EC) No 2501/2001) still applies. Common Customs Tariff specific duties are reduced by 30 %.     Where Common Customs Tariff duties on products listed in Annex II as sensitive products include ad valorem duties and specific duties, the specific duties are not reduced.     Agricultural products are subject to a special monitoring mechanism to avoid disturbances in the Community market. Agricultural products continue to be subject to safeguard clauses applied under the Common Agricultural Policy.      Special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance      Under the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance, Common Customs Tariff ad valorem duties on products listed in Annex II are in principle suspended. Specific duties are also suspended, unless there is also an ad valorem duty. By contrast, specific duties on certain types of chewing gum are limited to 16 % of the customs value.     This arrangement replaces the special arrangements to combat drug production and trafficking in force under the previous GSP (       Regulation (EC) No 2501/2001      ) and therefore enters into force, exceptionally, on 1 July 2005.     The countries that will benefit from this arrangement are those that are considered to be vulnerable due to their lack of diversification and insufficient integration into the international trading system. This applies to countries not classified by the World Bank as high income countries for three consecutive years. These are also countries where the five largest sections of GSP-covered imports to the Community represent more than 75 % in value of their total GSP-covered imports, and where GSP-covered imports to the Community represent less than 1 % in value of total GSP-covered imports to the Community.     These countries are listed in Annex I to the Regulation (column E). Such countries must have made a valid request to the Commission by 31 October 2005 in order to benefit from the arrangement as of 1 January 2006. The definitive list of beneficiary countries is published in the Official Journal after requests have been examined.     For the 2006-2008 period, the countries benefiting from the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance are Bolivia, Columbia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Georgia, Guatemala, Honduras, Sri Lanka, the Republic of Moldova, Mongolia, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, El Salvador and Venezuela.     To become beneficiaries, countries are also subject to a general obligation to ratify and effectively implement the international conventions listed in Annex III to the Regulation. Annex III distinguishes between two types of international convention:      Core human and labour rights UN/ILO Conventions (Part A of Annex III). Ratification and effective implementation of these is in principle obligatory. If, however, a country is faced with specific constitutional constraints, and has neither ratified nor effectively implemented two of the sixteen conventions on the list, it must make a formal commitment to do so by 31 October 2005 at the latest, or 31 December 2006 if there is an incompatibility with its Constitution;       Conventions related to the environment and governance principles (Part B of Annex III). Ratification and effective implementation of at least seven of the international conventions listed in Part B is required. The remaining international conventions must be ratified and effectively implemented by 31 December 2008 at the latest.      The Commission monitors this obligation closely, to ensure that it has been respected and applied.      Special arrangement for least developed countries      These countries are listed in Annex I to the Regulation (column D). In line with the "Everything But Arms" initiative, Common Customs Tariff duties are entirely suspended for all products except arms and ammunition.     By contrast, a gradual reduction in Common Customs Tariff duties, culminating in their total suspension, is planned for certain products, namely husked rice, some banana varieties, and white sugar. During the lead-up to total suspension, husked rice and white sugar are to benefit from a global tariff quota at zero duty. The Commission will be assisted by the management committees for the relevant common market organisations in administering these quotas.     The list of least developed countries is drawn up by the United Nations, which may also decide to remove countries from the list. In such cases the Commission removes the country in question from the list of countries benefiting from the arrangement. Removal is progressive, and involves a transitional period of at least three years.      Temporary withdrawal      Temporary withdrawal from the preferential arrangements may affect some or all of the products from the country in question. It is mainly a consequence of the behaviour of the country concerned, and may result from:      serious and systematic violations of the international conventions listed in part A of Annex III;       serious and systematic unfair trading practices;       trade in drugs, or failure to comply with international conventions on money-laundering;       serious and systematic infringements of the rules governing fisheries and fishery resources;       export of goods made by prison labour.      A temporary withdrawal decision may be made if there are sufficient grounds for an investigation to be opened. The investigation is carried out by the Commission in liaison with the Generalised Preferences Committee, which assists the Commission in implementing the Regulation, the beneficiary country, and international organisations and agencies. Withdrawal therefore follows an enquiry and investigation procedure, and measures, and is decided by the Council. A withdrawal decision, in principle, enters into force six months after its adoption.     Failure to comply with rules of origin or provide administrative cooperation are also grounds for a Commission decision to suspend preferences. Administrative cooperation mainly concerns the information that beneficiary countries are obliged to supply regarding rules of origin and the respect thereof. As well as information supplied to the Commission, it may also involve missions or enquiries carried out by the Commission itself.     Beneficiary countries may be removed from the scheme (graduation) if the World Bank classifies them as high-income countries, or if they are bound to the Community by a preferential commercial agreement.     Tariff preferences for all products from countries benefiting from the general arrangement and the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance may also be removed. Removal may be justified by the volume of Community imports of the product concerned from the beneficiary country, i.e. if it reaches 15 % of the total volume of Community imports of the same product from countries that are beneficiaries of one of these two arrangements.      Safeguard clause      The safeguard clause entails restoring the Common Customs Tariff duties. It is generally implemented when imports of a product cause serious difficulties or create direct competition with similar products from a Community producer. Serious difficulties are assessed using criteria measuring Community producers' market share, production, stocks, production capacity, bankruptcies, profitability, capacity utilisation, employment, imports and prices.     Investigations are opened at the request of a Member State or on the Community's own initiative, and must in principle be completed within six months, unless an extension decision is granted. As with the withdrawal procedure, the Commission decision is made on the basis of an information meeting establishing the facts, and on exchanges between the parties. Preventive measures may be taken if they are justified by exceptional circumstances.      Background      Trade preferences are intended to ensure that the Common Commercial Policy is consistent with development policy. The Community aims to help eradicate poverty and promote sustainable development and good governance in developing countries, while still abiding by the rules laid down by the World Trade Organisation.     The GSP was first introduced in the 1970s. The system covered by this Regulation is part of a more generalised plan for GSP for the ten years from 2006 to 2015, the foundations of which were laid by the Commission communication of 7 July 2004 entitled "Developing countries, international trade and sustainable development: the function of the Community's generalised system of preferences (GSP) for the ten-year period from 2006 to 2015." It therefore covers the first stage, for the period 2006-2008.

The paper shows that the preferential rules of origin need to be reviewed. This review is also important on account of the priority accorded to integrating developing countries into the world economy. This revision should be accompanied by an adaptation of the management and monitoring procedures. The Commission proposals cover:      a review of the conditions for a product to be considered as originating in a country;       a change in the customs procedures necessary for the proper implementation and supervision of the use of the preferences by economic operators;       the development of instruments ensuring that the beneficiary countries comply with their obligations.

   Healthcare in other EU countries — patients’ rights     Healthcare in other EU countries — patients’ rights     SUMMARY OF:      Directive 2011/24/EU on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare      WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?      It sets out the conditions under which a patient may travel to another EU country to receive safe and high-quality medical care and have the cost reimbursed by their own health insurance scheme.       It also encourages cooperation between national healthcare systems.      KEY POINTS      The EU country providing the treatment must ensure that:          all the information necessary is available for patients to make an informed choice including on treatment options, availability, quality and safety of the healthcare provided, prices, authorisation or registration status;           transparent complaint procedures exist;           professional liability insurance or similar guarantees are in place;           privacy of personal data is respected;           patients have access to a written or electronic record of the treatment they receive;           the scale of healthcare fees charged are the same as for domestic patients who are in a comparable medical situation, or the price charged is calculated according to objective, non-discriminatory criteria if there is no comparable price for domestic patients.         The EU country where the patient is insured must ensure that:          the cost of the healthcare provided is reimbursed;           information on patient rights and entitlements is available;           patients have access to any necessary medical follow-up treatment;           patients have access to their medical records.         National contact points exist to provide information and to consult with patient organisations and healthcare providers and insurers.       Healthcare providers give all the necessary information to patients so they can make an informed decision, including:          treatment options;           availability;           quality and safety of the healthcare they provide;           prices;           authorisation or registration status.         A patient's own country must reimburse the cost of the treatment according to the scales it applies domestically.       A patient may require prior authorisation from their own country before going abroad for treatment. This may be necessary if the medical care involves at least one night in hospital and/or the use of highly specialised and cost-intensive medical equipment, or if it poses a particular risk for the patient or the population.       A national authority may refuse to give prior authorisation if it considers that it can provide the patient with the necessary healthcare within a medically justifiable time limit.       Requests for medical treatment in another EU country must be dealt with within a reasonable period of time.       Prescriptions issued in one EU country are valid in another.       National health authorities must cooperate with each other in implementing the legislation and in developing         European reference networks        between healthcare providers and centres of expertise.       The cooperation extends to tackling         rare diseases        , developing         e-health        and assessing new health technology.       The legislation does not cover long-term care or the allocation of and access to organs or vaccinations.       The directive does not affect how EU countries organise and finance their national health systems for their own citizens.       The         European Commission        produces a report every 3 years on the way the system is working and how the directive operates. The first         report        was adopted in September 2015 and a subsequent         one        was adopted in September 2018.      The Commission has adopted a number of       implementing      and       delegated      acts related to Directive 2011/24/EU. These include:      Implementing Directive         2012/52/EU        on the recognition of medical prescriptions issued in another EU country;       Implementing Decision         2013/329/EU        on the establishment, management and the transparent functioning of the network of national authorities or bodies responsible for health technology assessment;       Delegated Decision         2014/286/EU        on criteria and conditions that European reference networks and healthcare providers wishing to join a European reference network must fulfil;       Implementing Decision         2014/287/EU        on criteria for establishing and evaluating European reference networks and their members and for facilitating the exchange of information and expertise on establishing and evaluating such networks;       Implementing Decision         2019/1765        on the establishment, management and the functioning of the network of national authorities responsible for e-health, which was subsequently amended by Implementing Decision (EU)         2020/1023        , on the cross-border exchange of data between national contact-tracing and contact-warning mobile applications with regard to combatting the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, amending Implementing Decision (EU) 2020/1023 adds two new annexes to Implementing Decision         2019/1765        , which respectively deal with the responsibilities of:          the participating EU countries as joint controllers for the federation gateway for cross-border processing between national contact-tracing and contact-warning mobile applications; and           the Commission as data processor for the federation gateway for cross-border processing between national contact-tracing and contact-warning mobile applications.        FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?     It has applied since 24 April 2011 and had to become law in the EU countries by 25 October 2013.     BACKGROUND      The reason the rules for cross-border healthcare needed clarifying is that they had been developed based on individual judgments of the         Court of Justice of the European Union        over a period of more than 10 years. The directive was brought forward specifically to clarify the rights to healthcare which derive from the Court’s rulings based on         Article 56 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union        and to enable these rights to be used in practice. The directive aims to clarify the relationship between its rules on cross-border healthcare and the existing framework provided by Regulation (EC) No         883/2004        (see         summary        ) on social security coordination.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 816/2006 – compulsory licensing of patents relating to the manufacture of pharmaceuticals for export to countries with public health problems   summary    what does this regulation do  It establishes a procedure for companies in the EU wishing to manufacture generic medicines for use in the developing world to apply for a compulsory licence from a patent holder, which allows their manufacture.   key points    The importing countries eligible to benefit from the scheme are:   the world's least developed countries;   those which have informed the  World Trade Organization  of their intention to do so;   those listed in the  OECD development assistance committee list  of low-income countries.     The importing countries must confirm they will use the scheme for public-health purposes, not for industrial or commercial objectives.   Any person who has failed to secure authorisation from the patent holder may submit a request for a compulsory licence to the relevant national authority.   They must provide personal details, information on the product, the amount they intend to produce and the destination countries.   This must be backed by a specific request from the country concerned, a non-governmental organisation or a  United Nations  body.   The relevant national authority in the EU informs the rights-holder and verifies the validity of the request before taking a decision.   Conditions attached to the compulsory licence determine the quantities involved and duration of the concession. Products made under licence must be clearly identifiable by specific labelling or marking.   Products manufactured under a compulsory licence may not be reimported and sold in the EU. Any suspected of breaking the law may, initially, be detained for 10 days and ultimately seized.   A licensee failing to respect the conditions of a compulsory licence may find it reviewed and even terminated.   from when does the regulation apply  It entered into force on 29 June 2006.   background   The legislation is part of wider EU action to tackle public-health concerns that the world’s least developed and developing countries face, in particular access to safe, effective and affordable medicines.

summary   This Directive repeals and replaces Directive  92/61/EEC  , which laid down the procedure for Community type-approval of two or three-wheel motor vehicles, of components and of separate technical units. It aims to clarify and complete certain provisions of the previous Directive.  It was recently supplemented by Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 on the approval and market surveillance of two- or three-wheel vehicles and quadricycles, which sets new requirements in terms of security and the environment for the acceptance by type of these vehicles.   Provisions of Directive 2002/24/EC   The vehicles covered by the Directive are two- or three-wheel motorised vehicles and light motorised quadricycles.  All applications for type-approval or component type-approval are lodged by the manufacturers or producers or their authorised representative in a Member State.  Member States are to type-approve the vehicle, component or technical entities which satisfy the technical requirements of the specific regulations or directives which apply to them and correspond to the data supplied by the manufacturer or producer (see the exhaustive lists set out in the annex to the Directive).  A certificate of conformity is to be completed by the manufacturer or his authorised representative for each vehicle produced in conformity with the approved type and for each non-original technical entity or component manufactured in conformity with the type that has been component type-approved.  The Member States are to confirm that each type of vehicle has undergone the checks provided for in the separate directives and has been issued with a type-approval certificate. The manufacturers may prepare a certificate of conformity for all vehicles conforming to the type that has been approved. When a vehicle is accompanied by this certificate it may be placed on the market, sold and registered for use throughout the European Union.  Any vehicle produced in conformity with the approved type must bear a type-approval mark consisting of:   the type-approval number;   the letter e followed by the identifying number or initials of the Member State conducting the type-approval;   the vehicle identification number.   The manufacturer of a vehicle and the producer of a technical entity or component are to be responsible for the manufacture of each vehicle or the production of each technical entity or component in conformity with the type which has been type-approved or component type-approved.  If a Member State confirms that vehicles, technical entities or components constitute a road safety hazard, even though they are of a type which has been type-approved or component type-approved, it may ban the sale, placing in service or use in its territory for a maximum period of six months. It must immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States thereof.  Only vehicles, technical entities and components complying with the Directive may be marketed, sold and used in the Member States.   Provisions of Regulation (EU) No 168/2013   The Regulation aims to guarantee a high level of vehicle functional safety, work security and protection of the environment, while harmonising the technical requirements and environmental standards applicable to vehicles, the systems, components and technical entities in relation to acceptance by type.  In particular it specifies that new motorcycles with more than 125 cc must be fitted with an anti-lock brake system, and those with under 125 cc must be fitted with an anti-lock system or a combined brake system, with the choice being left to the manufacturer.  In addition it makes it obligatory from January 1 2016, to fit an automatic system to switch on the lights, in order to improve visibility on all new category L (light) vehicles. It also sets out the requirements for the progressive installation of embedded diagnostic systems which will make it possible to detect failures and to monitor the emission control system.  In terms of environmental performance, the Commission will present a report concerning the dates of application and the emission limit figures at the Euro 5 level, mentioned in annex IV of the Regulation, to the European Parliament and the Council by 31 December 2016 at the latest. The role and responsibilities of the Member States responsible for monitoring the market are clarified and the requirements concerning the competence, obligations and performance of the technical department responsible for conducting tests to carry out acceptance by type are improved.  The Regulation also states that manufacturers must provide independent operators with unrestricted access to information on the repair and maintenance of vehicles, by means of internet sites.

summary of   Directive 2003/96/EC — restructuring the EU’s system for the taxation of energy products and electricity   what is the aim of the directive   It lays down European Union (EU) rules on taxes in regard to electricity, all motor fuels and most heating fuels.   The purpose is to ensure that the EU’s single market for energy operates smoothly and to avoid any distortions of trade and competition which could result from big differences in national tax systems.   The rules contribute to wider goals such as moving to a competitive, low-carbon, energy-efficient economy.   key points    Energy products are taxed only when used as motor fuel or for heating.   The legislation introduces minimum levels of tax on motor fuels, heating fuels and electricity applicable from 1 January 2004.   Energy products used for heating, in agriculture, stationary motors and machinery for construction and public works can be taxed at lower levels than fuel for cars.   Governments may apply a lower rate of duty on commercial diesel (when used by road hauliers or for passenger transport) than on diesel for non-commercial use.   The directive allows tax exemptions and reductions in particular for environmental and health policy reasons. Governments may exempt from taxation  renewable energy sources  such as biofuels or fuels and electricity used to transport goods and passengers by train, metro, tram or trolleybus.   The legislation allows for reduced taxes for energy-intensive firms — those that have made the greatest effort to reduce consumption. EU countries which had difficulty implementing the new measures were given transitional arrangements before applying the legislation (Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria and Portugal).   Similar temporary exemptions and transitional periods were granted to the countries that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007.   The legislation does not apply to some energy-intensive sectors (e.g. in metallurgy) or to energy products which have a dual use, i.e. they are used both for heating and for another purpose (e.g. for the production of certain chemicals).   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 31 October 2003. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 31 December 2003.   background   For more information, see:    ‘Excise Duties: Current Energy Tax Rules’  on the European Commission's website.
   Community action for regions bordering the candidate countries     Community action for regions bordering the candidate countries     This Communication proposes a series of specific measures aimed at strengthening the economic competitiveness of European Union (EU) regions bordering the acceding countries.     ACT     Communication of 25 July 2001 from the Commission on the impact of enlargement on regions bordering candidate countries - Community action for border regions [       COM(2001) 437      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     Updated by:     Progress Report of 29 November 2002 on the Communication from the Commission on the impact of enlargement on regions bordering candidate countries - Community action for border regions [       COM(2002)660      final].     SUMMARY      The challenge of the enlargement of the EU      , foreseen for 1 May 2004, with eight central and eastern European countries (Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Slovenia) and two Mediterranean countries (Cyprus and Malta) is unprecedented in the history of the EU. Over and above the purely economic considerations, the success of enlargement depends to a large extent on the support of present and future European citizens.     Within the framework of the accession partnership and the adoption of the Community       acquis      , the EU is providing important financial and technical assistance, helping the future Member States in implementing deep structural reforms. The agreement on agricultural and regional policy reached in December 2002 at the Copenhagen European Council allowed to provisionally close the accession negotiations and lay down financial assistance for these countries until the end of 2006.     The economic gap between the existing and the future Member States is considerable. This is especially visible along large parts of the EU's border with candidate countries. Particular attention needs to be paid to these areas in order to turn the challenge of enlargement into a real opportunity of socio-economic development. Reinforcing information and communication measures is a good means of attaining such an objective.      THE ECONOMIC SITUATION OF BORDER REGIONS      The border regions concerned are defined as regions at       NUTS II level      , bordering the acceding countries by land or sea and situated around NUTS III regions involved in cross-border programmes under the       INTERREG III A      Community Initiative in the period 2000-2006. The EU counts 23 such border regions:      two in Finland: Uusimaa, Etelä-Suomi;       eight in Germany: Niederbayern, Oberpfalz, Oberfranken, Brandenburg, Berlin, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Chemnitz, Dresden;       six in Austria: Burgenland, Niederösterreich, Wien, Kärnten, Steiermark, Oberösterreich;       two in Italy: Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia;       five in Greece: Anatoliki Makedonia - Thraki, Kentriki Makedonia, Aegean Islands (North), Aegean Islands (South), and Crete.      There are important disparities between these regions, mainly regarding the economic development, the employment rate, the infrastructure, the level of education, or the share of the gross domestic product (GDP) devoted to research. While the per capita income is relatively high in Italy, Finland, most Austrian regions and Bavaria, it is lower than 75% of the EU average in the new German Länder, Greece and Austria's Burgenland. Compared to the whole EU, the group of these 23 border regions nevertheless attains the present EU's average development level and employment rate. Per capita income and productivity are also higher in these regions than in the neighbouring regions of the acceding countries, except for Bratislava. The       Second Progress Report      on economic and social cohesion provides an important insight into the particular socio-economic situation of border regions.      Existing Community policies      For the 2000-06 period, the border regions of acceding countries will benefit from several forms of Community financial assistance through:      the Cohesion and Structural Funds;The new German Länder, all the Greek regions and Burgenland are eligible for         Objective 1        (assistance to regions whose economic development is lagging behind). Several areas adjacent to candidate countries in Germany, Austria, Italy and Finland receive assistance under         Objective 2        and partially under         Objective 3        . The INTERREG III Community initiative grants European assistance for cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation. Additionally, the three other Community Initiatives (         LEADER+        for rural development,         EQUAL        for equality in the labour market and         URBAN II        for urban areas) are important sources of support.       pre-accession assistance for candidate countries;Similar to the Structural Funds, the pre-accession assistance includes the financial instruments         ISPA        and         Sapard        and the         Phare programme        . Phare also provides specific support to         cross-border cooperation        (Phare-CBC) between geographical areas at NUTS III level situated on both sides of the border.       State aid for regional purposes The majority of the NUTS III regions bordering accession countries qualify for state aid for regional purposes, except for four: Wiener Umland Nord and Süd in Austria and Neustadt a/d Waldnaab and Schwandorf in Germany. This state aid helps businesses in the border regions to cope with the special problems of the enlargement process. Furthermore, under the present state aid rules, a substantial complementary assistance is offered to Member States.       Trans-European networks in transport, energy and telecommunication;       the loans of the European Investment Bank (EIB);These loans are meant to support environmental and transport infrastructure projects.       other Community programmes in the area of education, training, youth and environment.       Effects of enlargement in border regions      Since the transition process started in 1990, the border regions have already benefited from their geographical proximity to the EU. The relatively well-developed infrastructure and low labour costs have contributed to stimulating markets, investments and tourism in these areas.     The income gap between the EU and the accession countries has led to fears of large migration flows into the EU. In the light of the studies carried out and the experience of the accession of Spain and Portugal in 1986, the migration from the future Member States towards the EU should not exceed 1% of the present European population and the negative impact on wage levels is rather modest. Furthermore, the accession negotiations have established a series of measures (including a transition period, a review mechanism, safeguards and declarations of the Member States), which progressively introduce free movement of workers over 5-7 years. Immigration may even help to limit the adverse effects of ageing populations and to overcome labour shortages in some sectors.     The daily cross-border migrations vary considerably from one border region to the other, ranging from 1 to 8% of labour in different regions. Cross-border commuting affects mainly Germany and Austria. In the first case, it is mainly focused along the border of Bavaria with the Czech Republic. As for the second, Austria shares borders with four candidate countries (Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Slovenia) and its main economic centres (Vienna, Graz and Linz) are located close to these borders.     With regard to economic integration, the competitive pressure generally associated with enlargement is already noticeable since the EU has lifted most customs duties and quantitative restrictions in trade in agricultural and industrial products from candidate countries. In general, capital-intensive and technologically advanced sectors in the border regions are likely to benefit from enlargement, while labour-intensive sectors (agriculture, heavy industry) are likely to face competition from cheaper labour coming from acceding countries.      COMMUNITY ACTION FOR BORDER REGIONS      The Commission estimates that the measures taken for all the EU regions need to be complemented by other action to contribute to better economic integration. Instead of creating a new specific instrument, a combination of new and improved existing measures will be most effective in addressing the specific needs of border regions. Moreover, the focus should be placed on providing better information on the objectives and benefits of enlargement.     The new measures aim to provide specific additional funding to border regions, worth a total of EUR 305 million. These measures are the following:      EUR 150 million to support the trans-European transport network (TEN-T);The relevant         Financial Regulation        regarding TEN projects currently limits Community contributions to a maximum of 10% of the total project cost, causing a problem for acceding countries with limited resources. For the cross-border projects aimed at eliminating mainly rail bottlenecks, the Commission proposes raising the existing 10% threshold to 20%. In order to complement the ISPA assistance for acceding countries, the Commission decided to allocate additional assistance of EUR 100 million to the Member States for the 2003-06 period, and EUR 50 million from existing funds not already committed.       Developing a municipal infrastructure facility in co-operation with the EIB to support small-scale municipal infrastructure projects in the social and economic sectors.First focused on Poland, this assistance will ultimately cover all the acceding countries. EUR 35 million for 2002 and EUR 15 million for 2003 is allocated under the Phare programme.       Additional assistance of EUR 50 million under INTERREG III;A special support of EUR 30 million to border regions derives from the flexibility instrument and addresses 13 INTERREG III programmes covering regions bordering on the future Member States, and the Strand B INTERREG III programme for the Baltic Sea Region. Furthermore, the creation of networks (e.g. INTERACT), information activities and the technical assistance to project development benefit from additional assistance of EUR 20 million.       An additional amount of EUR 45 million for the competitivity of the regions and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);Initiated by the European Parliament, the budget line (Pilot project on the impact of enlargement for the regions bordering the candidate countries) granted support of EUR 30 million to the ARGE project, which is a network of 28 chambers of commerce located in the EU regions bordering the acceding countries. The aim of this project is to strengthen the competitiveness of labour-intensive enterprises in three areas: information, implementing a development strategy and cross-border cooperation.In addition, the Commission has published three calls for proposals, for a total amount of EUR 15 million. These aim to encourage cross-border cooperation and are meant to support the         Euro-Info Centres        , trade unions, regional and local authorities.       Additional measures in favour of young people;EUR 10 million has been additionally allocated to the YOUTH programme for the 2003-2006 period. The national agencies which manage the programme in a decentralised manner are invited to present cross-border cooperation plans with a view to encourage mobility, initiative, intercultural learning and solidarity among young people from the present and future Member States.      In addition to these measures providing additional funding, the action plan of the Commission proposes a better co-ordination of existing policies. The aim of this action plan is to strengthen the coherence and efficiency of Community policies with an important impact on border regions:      To improve the co-ordination between Phare-CBC and INTERREG;On 6 September 2002, the Commission amended the Phare-CBC Regulation to make it more consistent with INTERREG III, namely regarding the eligibility of actions. This amendment is applicable for Phare 2003 programming. On the same date, the Commission adapted the Phare Guidelines 2003-06 in order to enable acceding countries to use their Phare funds for participating in the INTERREG programmes.Under the territorial principle, the Commission has drawn the conclusion that the current legislative framework clearly rules out the use of Structural Funds resources - and namely those available for INTERREG - for investment projects, e.g. sewage plants, bridges, technology centres, outside the territory of the European Union. A less rigid interpretation of the territorial principle is however feasible in the following cases: to finance expenses for participants from non-Community countries at meetings of the monitoring committees and subcommittees from the technical assistance budget according to         Regulation No 1685/2000        on eligible costs; to reimburse the same expenses (travel and subsistence expenses, seminars, work placements, language courses) for the strand A projects of INTERREG III, except for the investment projects; to purchase services or equipment from partner countries, in accordance with EC public procurement law.In view of its geographical position in close proximity to four acceding countries, Vienna is now eligible for INTERREG III A programmes with Hungary and the Czech Republic [Official Journal C 239 of 25.9.2001].       Policy initiatives in the agricultural sector;To improve the competitiveness and diversification of economic activities, the border regions can re-orient their rural development programmes in the light of the mid-term evaluations foreseen for the end of 2003.The implementation of the "trans-national co-operation" strand of the LEADER + Community Initiative regarding rural development is effective and includes the participation of acceding countries.      The floods of summer 2002 in Eastern Europe caused serious human and material damage in certain border regions in Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic. To be able to respond immediately to the needs of those suffering a disaster, the European Union has established the       European Union Solidarity Fund      , for which the annual allocation amounts to EUR 1 billion. In 2003, it will support the above regions. It is not limited geographically, but by the nature and size of the disaster.     RELATED ACTS      Commission Regulation (EC) No         2760/98        of 18 December 1998 concerning the implementation of a programme for cross-border cooperation in the framework of the PHARE programme [Official Journal L 345 of 19.12.1998]      This Regulation concerns the implementation of       cross-border cooperation      in the framework of the PHARE programme.

   Concessions under Community law     Concessions under Community law     Concessions differ from public contracts in the transfer of the responsibilities of operation that they entail. The European Commission identifies the specific characteristics of works and service concessions. It specifies the rules and principles applicable to this type of contract under the Treaty and secondary legislation, as well as the Court of Justice case law.     ACT     Commission interpretative communication on concessions under Community law [Official Journal C 121 of 29.04.2000]     SUMMARY     The Treaty establishing the European Community does not define concessions       *      . It is only Directive       93/37/EEC      on public works contracts       *      that lays down specific provisions for works concessions. Service concessions, however, which have developed in practice in several Member States, are subject to the rules and principles of the EC Treaty.     SCOPE     This communication addresses concessions in which a public authority entrusts a third party with the total (or partial) management of an economic activity which is normally the authority's responsibility and for which the third party assumes the operating risk.     The communication does not concern:      acts whereby a public authority authorises the exercise of an economic activity.Examples: taxi concessions, authorisations to use the public highway (newspaper kiosks, café terraces), or acts relating to pharmacies and filling stations;       acts concerning non-economic activities such as compulsory schooling or social security.      Relationships between public authorities and public enterprises entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest are, in principle, covered by this communication. The Community law on concessions does not cover interorganic or "in-house" relationships that specifically mean that the awarding authority exercises over the concessionaire a control which is similar to that which it exercises over its own departments and carries out the essential part of its activities with that party.      Works concessions      Directive       93/37/EEC      distinguishes a works concession from a public works contract by the fact that the concessionaire is granted the right to exploit a construction as a consideration for having erected it. The existence of an exploitation risk related to the investment made is the determining factor. This right of exploitation may also be accompanied by payment.     The right of exploitation implies the transfer of the responsibilities of operation from the grantor to the concessionaire. These responsibilities cover the technical, financial and managerial aspects of the construction. For example, the concessionaire is responsible for making the investments required so that the construction is available to users under good conditions. He is responsible for paying off the construction and bears the risks inherent in the construction, management and use of the facilities.     The right of exploitation allows the concessionaire to demand payment, over a certain period of time, from those who use the structure erected and/or other forms of remuneration from exploitation, such as tolls, fees or "shadow tolls". The fact that the right of exploitation may be accompanied by payment does not change if the sum paid covers only a part of the cost of the construction. It can happen that a State bears part of the costs of operating the concession in order to keep prices down for users. This partial remuneration can take the form of a flat rate amount or a sum paid on the basis of the number of users. This partial remuneration should not, however, have the effect of eliminating the risk inherent in exploitation that is borne by the concessionaire - otherwise it will be reclassified as a public works contract.      Service concessions      Directive       92/50/EEC      on public service contracts does not define service concessions. The new Directive       2004/18/EC      defines service concessions as contracts of the same type as a public service contract except for the fact that the consideration for the provision of services consists either solely in the right to exploit the service or in this right together with payment. Service concessions are, however, not subject to any detailed rules in the Directive.     Nonetheless, service concessions are subject to the principles and rules enshrined in the EC Treaty. A service concession exists when the operator bears the risks involved in establishing and exploiting the service. The operator obtains revenue from the user, particularly by charging fees. As is the case for works concessions, service concessions are characterised by a transfer of the responsibility of exploitation.     How does one determine which system applies in the case of mixed contracts involving works carried out and the provision of one or more services? In practice, this is in fact virtually always the case, since public works concessionaires often provide services to users on the basis of the structure they have built. If the       main      subject matter of the contract concerns the building of a structure on behalf of the grantor, it should be considered as a works concession. This is the case, for example, for a motorway or toll bridge. If the contract includes several elements that may be separated, the rules that apply to each should be applied separately. For example, motorway catering services may be the subject of a different service concession from that involving its construction or management.      COMMUNITY PROVISIONS APPLYING TO CONCESSIONS      The Treaty establishing the European Community prohibits any discrimination on grounds of nationality and establishes rules on the free movement of goods, the freedom of establishment, and the freedom to provide services. Works or service concessions are subject in particular to Articles 28 to 30 and 43 to 55 that are based on the following principles:      Equality of treatment.This principle implies in particular that all potential concessionaires know the rules in advance and that they apply to everybody in the same way. The Court has stipulated that in order to permit an objective comparison between offers, these offers should all conform to the tender specifications. And, if an awarding authority takes account of changes to a specific offer after the tenders are opened, the Court considers that the tenderer concerned has obtained an advantage. Provisions reserving public contracts only to companies of which the State or the public sector is a major, or the sole, shareholder contravene the principle of equality of treatment.       Transparency.The principle of transparency can be ensured by any appropriate means, including advertising, which contains the information necessary to enable potential concessionaires to decide whether they are interested in participating.In virtually all the Member States, the administrative rules or practices provide that the awarding authorities must make their intention public before launching a concession. In its Telaustria judgment, the Court of Justice of the European Union reiterates the awarding authority's obligation to guarantee all potential tenderers a proper degree of advertising in awarding concessions.       Proportionality.According to the principle of proportionality, any measure chosen should be both necessary and appropriate in the light of the objectives sought.With regard to concessions, a Member State may not impose technical, professional or financial conditions that are excessive and disproportionate when selecting candidates. Nor should the duration of the concession be set in such a way that it limits open competition beyond what is required to ensure that the investment is paid off and there is a reasonable return on invested capital, whilst maintaining a risk inherent in exploitation by the concessionaire.       Mutual recognition.According to the principle of mutual recognition, a Member State must accept the products and services supplied by economic operators from another Member State. It must also accept the technical specifications, checks, diplomas, certificates and qualifications required in another Member State if these are recognised as equivalent.      The Treaty provides for certain exceptions to the principles of the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services. For concessions, these exceptions are limited to cases covered by Article 45 of Treaty, such as those in which the concessionaire directly and specifically exercises official authority. As such, activities said to be in the "public interest" or carried out by virtue of an obligation or an exclusivity established by law are not therefore automatically covered by this exception.      Justifying decisions to refuse a tender      In the case of concessions, the awarding authority must give reasons for refusing or rejecting an offer so that any tenderer who considers that he/she has suffered damage can open an appeal procedure.     Directive       89/665/EC      on review procedures for public works contracts applies to works concessions.      Directive         93/37/EEC        on works concessions establishes specific advertising rules      Upstream, all awarding authorities must publish a public works concession notice in the Official Journal of the European Communities in order to put this contract up for competition at European level. This advertising rule applies irrespective of the nature of the potential concessionaire.     Downstream, there is the problem of contracts awarded by the concession contract holder. Everything depends on the legal nature of the concessionaire:      if the concessionaire is itself an awarding authority, contracts for works which are over the Community threshold must be awarded in full compliance with all the detailed provisions of the Directive on public works contracts;       if the concessionaire is not an awarding authority, the Directive stipulates that he/she must comply only with certain advertising rules.These rules are not applicable if the works contracts are awarded to grouped or affiliated undertakings.        Key terms used in the act         public contract: contract for pecuniary interest concluded in writing between a contracting body and an economic operator, which has as its object the execution of works, the supply of products or the provision of services.         (works or service) concession: a contract which differs from a public contract in that the source of revenue for the economic operator consists either solely in the right of exploitation or in this right together with payment.

   SOCRATES - Phase II     SOCRATES - Phase II     The aim of Socrates Phase II is to promote a Europe of knowledge and encourage lifelong education through learning foreign languages, encouraging mobility, promoting cooperation at European level, opening up to methods of access to education and increasing the use of new technologies in the field of education.     ACT     Decision No       253/2000/EC      of 24 January 2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the second phase of the Community programme in the field of education "SOCRATES" [Official Journal L 28 of 03.02.2000]     SUMMARY      Context      Based on experience acquired in the       first phase      of the SOCRATES programme, and on the aims defined by the Commission in its communication "       Towards a Europe of Knowledge      ", this Decision establishes the second phase of the "SOCRATES" action programme for implementing an education policy for the period between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2006.      Aims      The two main ideas behind SOCRATES II are: the promotion of lifelong learning and the development of a Europe of knowledge. The more specific aims of SOCRATES II are as follows:      to strengthen the European dimension in education at all levels;       to improve knowledge of foreign languages;       to promote cooperation and mobility in the field of education;       to encourage the use of new technologies in education;       to promote equal opportunities in all sectors of education.      Implementation of these aims at European level is complementary to the policies of the Member States. The Commission will ensure that programme measures are consistent with other Community measures and policies.      Action      The SOCRATES programme is implemented through eight measures, five of which are targeted, while the other three are transverse measures aimed at improving coordination within SOCRATES:        Comenius          : school education: nursery, primary and secondary schools       Aim: to increase the quality of education, strengthen the European dimension and promote language learning.     Comenius is aimed at players in the education community and civil society (local authorities, associations, NGOs, etc.) in order to carry out school projects (with a minimum of three establishments from three participating countries), linguistic projects (involving two establishments from two participating countries) and school development projects (with a minimum of three establishments from three participating countries); multilateral cooperation projects between different types of institutions. The Commission also awards individual grants to future teachers.        Erasmus          : higher, university and post-university education       Aim: to encourage mobility and language learning.     Erasmus is intended either for students, to promote their mobility, or for teachers in order to enable them to take part in exchanges, develop joint courses, programme intensive courses and take part in forming thematic networks.        Grundtvig          : adult education and other education pathways       Aim: to supplement Comenius and Erasmus by facilitating the integration of adults excluded from the school system.     Grundtvig is aimed at formal institutions (schools, universities) as well as informal ones (associations, museums, etc.), in order to carry out projects aimed at: improving cooperation between educational levels, creating education partnerships, carrying out mobility activities for training, and establishing Grundtvig networks for exchanging information.        Lingua          : language learning       Aim: to promote the targeted learning and teaching of languages.     Lingua is aimed at teachers and students from formal or informal institutions in at least three countries coming together to form partnerships aimed on the one hand at raising awareness, motivating and informing European citizens about language learning and on the other at developing technical tools to facilitate language learning.        Minerva          : information and communication technologies in education       Aim: to encourage the use of information and communication technologies (ICT), multimedia and open and distance learning (ODL).     Minerva is aimed at teachers and students from schools and universities, but also from the world of the multimedia industry, ICT and the civil society, in order to carry out projects aimed at: improving the understanding of innovation, designing new teaching methods, communicating project results and promoting the exchange of experience with regard to ODL and ICT.        Observation and innovation in education systems        Aim: to observe the educational contexts of other Member States in order to make each national education system innovative.     This measure is aimed at the entire education community and civil society in the wider sense (local authorities, associations, NGOs, etc.), in order to carry out projects aimed at: developing comparative analyses of education systems and policies (Eurydice), organising study visits (Arion), setting up a network of institutes (Naric), encouraging the recognition of diplomas and launching pilot projects.        Joint measures        Aim: to increase synergy in education policies (Socrates), vocational training (Leonardo da Vinci) and youth (Youth).     These measures are carried out by means of calls for proposals on themes common to the three programmes referred to above in order to increase the existing synergy.        Accompanying measures        Aim: to increase the flexibility of Socrates.     These measures are aimed at promoting cooperation in the field of education, disseminating project results, and improving the implementation of projects and the synergy between the various measures in the programme.      Beneficiaries      More specifically, the beneficiaries of the measures are: a) all pupils, students or other learners; b) all categories of education personnel; c) all types of education establishments; d) persons and bodies responsible for education systems and policies at local, regional and national level.     In addition, participation in the measures is also open to all public and private organisations cooperating with education establishments, particularly: a) local and regional authorities and organisations; b) associations working in the field of education; c) parents' associations; d) enterprises and groups of enterprises, and professional organisations; e) chambers of commerce and industry; f) social partner organisations at all levels; g) research centres and organisations.      Participating countries      The programme is open to the Member States of the European Union (Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom), the three countries of the European Economic Area (EEA - Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), the two candidate countries (Bulgaria and Romania) and Turkey.      Implementation of the programme      The programme is administered by       national agencies      in each participating country, ensuring a more direct link with citizens. The Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, is called upon to ensure, in spite of everything, the consistent implementation of the Community measures in the programme. In order to better achieve these aims of coordination and cooperation, the Commission is assisted by a committee composed of representatives of the Member States and chaired by the Commission representative.      Budget      The budget for the execution of the programme is set at EUR 1 850 million.     Decision No       451/2003/EC      introduces greater flexibility in the application of the principle of cofinancing for decentralised actions in favour of projects developed by small institutions.      Monitoring and evaluation      The programme is continuously monitored by the Commission in cooperation with the Member States. On the basis of two four-yearly reports from each Member State, the Commission will present to the European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions the following documents:      an interim evaluation report on the implementation of the programme, to be submitted by 30.6.2004;       a communication on the continuation of the programme, to be submitted by 31.12.2006;       an ex-post evaluation report, to be submitted by 31.12.2007.

Report from the Commission - Interim evaluation report on the results achieved and on the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the implementation of the second phase of the Community action programme in the field of education 'Socrates' [         COM(2000)153        -- Not published in the Official Journal].      Socrates is a complex programme consisting of many actions and sub-actions which are managed in different ways. For the period 2000-2003 it had a budget of EUR 1 850 million plus the annual contribution from the 15 associated countries. Based on the ratio of financial resources to results achieved, the programme is very efficient, with a great many activities of a small or medium scale having been carried out. The great diversity of the results achieved means that the field of education is widely covered. Moreover, the distribution of beneficiaries across the 30 participating countries is highly satisfactory, thus ensuring that the programme has a truly European dimension.     Mobility activities, which have continued to increase, are highly effective, particularly in the area of student mobility. The milestone of one million Erasmus students was celebrated in 2002, and the target of three million Erasmus students is expected to be reached in 2010. Achieving such an ambitious goal will require a significant increase in resources for this activity. On the other hand, teacher and trainer mobility is not as high as it could be. Most of the obstacles to mobility activities are outside the programme itself and concern the way in which mobility activities are organised nationally, the operating methods of educational establishments and, to a lesser extent, insufficient knowledge of languages. The Commission will have to work with the Member States to eliminate these obstacles and with those in the education sector to expand the availability of language training.     The programme is also effective in terms of interinstitutional cooperation. The partnerships involving schools and adult training bodies have been strengthened, as have the transnational cooperation projects. The networks have also found their footing after some of them had to redefine their objectives and specific characteristics during the programme. However, the programme is still not as effective as it could be as regards its visibility and the dissemination of its results. The European Year of Languages, organised as part of the Lingua programme, has made it possible to identify more clearly what is required in terms of language knowledge and the importance of activities which involve providing information and raising awareness. Efforts to tie the programme more closely to the vocational training sector should be stepped up in order to respond properly to the political challenge of creating a European area of lifelong learning.     It should be noted that programme administration has become more rigorous at all levels (projects, national and Community management structures). Increased decentralisation of the management of certain actions has made the programme more accessible to the public and simplified procedures for users. However, the programme's efficiency is regarded as rather more moderate when comparing the procedures with the nature and scale of most of the activities. It is unfortunate that an effective electronic management tool is not in place. The work to streamline procedures should be continued during the present programme and borne in mind when preparing the next one.     For further information on the statistics on implementation of the second phase of the Socrates programme, please consult the Commission's working paper [SEC(2004) 230 - Not published in the Official Journal].

   Cohesion Policy in support of growth and jobs - Community Strategic Guidelines, 2007-13     Cohesion Policy in support of growth and jobs - Community Strategic Guidelines, 2007-13     The Community strategic guidelines are an important part of the new cohesion policy starting in 2007. On the basis of the strategic guidelines, the Member States draw up their cohesion policy priorities. The guidelines contribute to the realisation of other Community priorities, such as those deriving from the Lisbon strategy and the integrated guidelines for growth and jobs. They are mainly concerned with investment, jobs, knowledge and innovation, territorial cohesion and cooperation.     ACT     Council Decision       2006/702/EC      of 6 October 2006 on Community strategic guidelines on cohesion [Official Journal L 291 of 21.10.06].     SUMMARY     The strategic guidelines for cohesion policy after 2007 have two objectives:      to strengthen the strategic dimension of cohesion policy with a view to ensuring that Community priorities are better integrated into the national and regional development programmes; and       to ensure greater ownership of cohesion policy on the ground, as reflected in a reinforced dialogue in the partnerships between the Commission, the Member States and the regions and the creation of a clearer division of responsibilities between the Commission, Member States and the Parliament.       The re-launch of the Lisbon strategy      At the March 2005 European Council, the       Lisbon Strategy      was renewed with the adoption of the partnership for growth and jobs. In line with this strategy, cohesion policy must be focused on promoting sustainable growth, competitiveness and jobs.     The strategic guidelines identify those areas in which cohesion policy can contribute to the achievement of other Community priorities, including those deriving from the Lisbon strategy. They are also in line with the integrated guidelines for       growth and jobs      .     Priorities under the strategic guidelines     The strategic guidelines are focused on three priorities:      improving the attractiveness of regions and cities in the Member States;       encouraging innovation, entrepreneurship and growth in the knowledge economy; and       creating more and better jobs.       Strategic Guidelines for 2007-2013      On the basis of these priorities, the guidelines aim to:      make Europe and its regions more attractive places to invest and work;       improve knowledge and innovation;       create more and better jobs; and       take account of the territorial dimension of cohesion policy.      Investment and jobs     The Communication lists three groups of measures for making Europe and its regions a more attractive place to invest and work.     First, transport infrastructures must be expanded and improved. With this in mind, the Member States must give priority to the 30 projects of European interest by investing in secondary connections. In addition, better access to rail infrastructure and improved connectivity of landlocked territories to the Trans-European network (TEN-T) must be encouraged. The same applies to the environmental dimension of transport networks and the development of short-sea shipping.     Secondly, the synergies between environmental protection and growth must be strengthened so as to guarantee the sustainability of economic growth, innovation and job creation. With this in mind, the Commission recommends investing in infrastructures, creating attractive conditions for businesses and their staff and putting in place risk prevention measures. In addition, the EU's Kyoto commitments must be taken into account.     Thirdly, traditional energy dependency must be reduced through improvements in energy efficiency and use of renewable energies.      Knowledge and innovation      The aims of growth and job creation will require a structural shift in the economy towards knowledge-based activities. To achieve this, it will be necessary to:      increase and improve investment in research and technological development (RTD), especially in the private sector (including through public-private partnerships (PPPs), small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and cooperation among companies);       facilitate innovation and encourage the creation of companies with the objective of promoting a climate which promotes the production, dissemination and use of new knowledge (entrepreneurship);       promote the information society and the dissemination of information and communication technology (ICT) equipment to companies and households; and       improve access to finance by creating financial engineering mechanisms, while supporting financial instruments other than subsidies.       Jobs      To create more and better jobs, cohesion policy must aim to address the challenges highlighted in the European employment strategy. In particular, more people must be attracted into and retained in employment through the modernisation of social protection systems.     In addition, worker adaptability and labour market flexibility must be increased by investing in human capital through improvements in education and skills. In line with these priorities, the administrative capacity of public administrations and services must be increased and a healthy labour force maintained.      Territorial cohesion and cooperation      Cohesion policy must be adapted to the particular needs and characteristics of individual regions in terms of the problems and opportunities which derive from their geographical situation. The territorial dimension includes the following themes:      the contribution of cities (urban areas) to growth and jobs (in order to promote entrepreneurship, local employment and community development, for example);       supporting the economic diversification of rural areas (e.g. the synergy between structural, employment and rural development policies); and       cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation focused on the aims of growth and job creation.

   Green public procurement     Green public procurement     The Commission wishes to encourage green public procurement which is an effective instrument in promoting environmentally-friendly products and services and in encouraging eco-innovation, thus contributing to sustainable development.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 16 July 2008 on Public procurement for a better environment [       COM(2008) 400 final      – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The objective of this Communication is to provide guidance on how to reduce the environmental impact caused by public sector consumption and how to use Green Public Procurement (GPP)       *      to stimulate innovation in environmental technologies, products and services.     More specifically, the Communication proposes instruments which should enable the main obstacles to increased take-up of green public procurement to be removed. The Commission recommends the following:      setting common green public procurement criteria;       encouraging publication of information on life cycle costing of products;       increasing certainty about legal possibilities to include environmental criteria in tender documents;       establishing political support for the promotion and implementation of green public procurement through a political target linked to indicators and future monitoring.       Scope      This Communication covers all public procurement procedures, both above and below the thresholds defined by European public procurement Directives. The Commission has identified ten priority sectors for GPP:      construction;       food and catering services;       transport;       energy;       office machinery and computers;       clothing and other textiles;       paper and printing services;       furniture;       cleaning products and services;       equipment used in the health sector.       Common GPP criteria      The Commission highlights the need to define common green public procurement criteria. A preliminary set of criteria for products and services in the ten priority sectors has been established in the framework of a "Training Toolkit" (       EN      ). The criteria have been based on criteria used in the granting of the European Eco-label, in particular, or, in the absence of a European label, national ecolabels and are the result of cooperation between the Commission and a group of experts made up of representatives from Member States.     GPP criteria are divided into two categories:      the         "core" criteria        are designed to allow easy application of green public procurement and are focused on the key area(s) of environmental performance of a product. They are aimed at keeping administrative costs to a minimum for companies who have to comply with the criteria and public authorities who have to enforce compliance with them. The Commission proposes that by 2010, 50% of all public procurement should comply with these criteria;       the         "comprehensive" criteria        take into account more aspects or are based on higher levels of environmental performance, for use by authorities that want to go further in supporting environmental goals.       Assessment and monitoring      In order to monitor green public procurement, the Commission proposes to establish two types of indicators:       quantitative indicators      to assess the progress of the policy and its impact on the supply side, and       impact-oriented indicators      allowing assessment of the environmental and financial gains made. In 2010, the Commission will evaluate the situation and produce a review which will serve as the basis for setting future targets.      Context      The potential for green public procurement was first highlighted in the European Union in 2003 in the Commission Communication on       integrated product policy      . In 2004, Directives       2004/17/EC      and       2004/18/EC      , which constitute the European framework for the procurement of public contracts, clarified how purchasers can integrate an environmental dimension into the tendering process. The Commission handbook "Buying green!", adopted in August 2004, aims to further clarify how these new rules can be used to conclude green public contracts.     The new       European Union strategy for sustainable development      , adopted by the Council in June 2006, set a target that by 2010 the average level of green public procurement in the EU should be the same as the 2006 level of the best performing Member States in this area.     This Communication is part of the Action Plan for Sustainable Consumption and Production and the Sustainable Industrial Policy (       SCP/SIP      ), which establishes a framework for the implementation of instruments aimed at improving the environmental performances of products.       Key terms of the Act         Green public procurement: a process whereby public authorities seek to procure goods, services and works with a reduced environmental impact throughout their life cycle when compared to goods, services and works with the same primary function that would otherwise be procured.

   Management of copyright and related rights in the internal market     Management of copyright and related rights in the internal market     The Commission addresses questions relating to the collective and individual management of copyright and related rights in the internal market. It would like to implement a common legislative framework for the collective management of rights and particularly for good governance of collecting companies.     ACT     Commission Communication of April 16, 2004 on the management of copyright and related rights in the internal market [       COM (2004) 261      - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This communication deals with the management of copyright and related rights, i.e. how they are administered (granted through licences, assigned or financed). It concludes a consultation process started in 1995.     The Commission considers whether current management methods, which are mainly governed by national legislations, hamper the good functioning of the internal market. The exchange of goods and services based on copyright or related rights increasingly often takes place at Community level. Accordingly, the legislative framework governing the protection of these rights has to cater for this.     The Commission considers whether it is convenient to let the market stimulate Community licensing or whether it is preferable to enact Community legislation. The Commission puts forward a number of options:      ensure that any licence on the rights to communicate with or make available to the public, allows - by definition - usage throughout the Community;       adopt the same model as the one chosen for         satellite broadcasting        under Directive         93/83/EEC        . The relevant act of communication to the public occurs solely in the Member State where the programme-carrying signals are introduced into an uninterrupted chain of communication up to the satellite and down towards the earth. The Commission expresses reservations, underlining that this approach does not necessarily yield the desired result of multi-territorial licensing;       bring the exclusive rights of communication to the public and of 'making available' under one remuneration right subject to obligatory collective management;       leave users the freedom to choose the collecting society within the European Economic Area which will issue the required operating licence;       empower collecting societies to offer Community licences;       focus exclusively on forms of collective management by specialised societies.      Another fundamental issue is the management of digital rights. Digital Rights Management systems (DRM systems) enable the distribution to be restricted to copies of digital content by obtaining and managing copyrights. To complete the internal market in this area, it is necessary to establish a global and interoperable technical infrastructure based on consensus among the interested parties, including consumers.     The management of copyrights and related rights can be done either individually or collectively. The Commission has examined these two ways of managing rights.      Individual Rights Management      It is the marketing of rights by individual rightholders to commercial users through exclusive or non-exclusive contractual licences.     The Commission has noted that the degree of common ground across Member States regarding the rules appears to be sufficient in this area. It is therefore not necessary to undertake action at Community level in the near future.      Collective Rights Management      This term refers to the system under which a collecting society, as trustee, jointly administers rights and monitors, collects and distributes the payment of royalties on behalf of several rightholders.     In this area, the Commission underlines the need to have a common legal framework based on the principles of copyright and the needs of the internal market. It would deal with issues linked to the establishment and status of collecting societies. This legislation would foster the emergence of Community licences for exploiting rights and would finalise the internal market.     It has initiated a new consultation process which has led to the adoption of a recommendation on cross-border collective management of copyright and relative rights in the field of legal       on-line music services      . It also intends to put forward legislation on certain features of collective management and good governance of collecting societies in order to ensure a higher degree of efficiency, legal certainty and transparency.

summary of   Directive 85/374/EEC — product liability   summary    what does this directive do  It establishes the principle of liability without fault applicable to European producers. Where a defective product* causes damage to a consumer, the producer may be liable even without negligence or fault on their part.   key points    Damage covered   The directive applies to damage:        —     caused by death or by personal injuries,            —     caused to private property.      EU countries may set a limit for the total liability of a producer in the case of death or personal injury caused by identical items with the same defect.   Liability   A  producer  can mean:        —     the producer of a raw material, the manufacturer of a finished product or of a component part,            —     the importer of the product,            —     any person putting their name, trade mark or other distinguishing feature on the product,            —     any person supplying a product whose producer or importer cannot be identified.      Where 2 or more persons are liable for the same damage, they shall be liable jointly.   Proof of damage   A product is defective where it does not provide the safety which a person is entitled to expect, taking all circumstances into account, including:        —     the presentation of the product,            —     the reasonable use of the product,            —     the time when the product was put on the market.      The  injured person carries theburden of proof  . They must prove:        —     actual damage,            —     a defect in the product,            —     a causal link between the damage and the defect.      However, he does not have  to prove the negligence or fault  of the producer or importer.   Exemption from liability   A number of factors can exempt a producer from liability including if:        —     they did not put the product into circulation,            —     the defect appeared after the product was put into circulation,            —     the product was not manufactured by them to be sold or distributed for profit            —     the product was not manufactured or distributed by them for any purpose within the usual transactions and practices of their business,            —     the defect is due to compliance of the product with mandatory regulations issued by public authorities,            —     the defect of a component was caused during the manufacture of a final product.      When the injured person is at fault, the producer’s liability may be reduced.   Expiry of liability         —     The injured person has  3 years  within which to seek compensation. This period starts from the date on which the injured person became aware of the damage, the defect and the identity of the producer.            —     The producer is no longer liable  10 years  after the date the product was put on the market.            —     No contractual clause may allow the producer to limit his liability in relation to the injured person.            —     National laws on civil liability still apply.      from when does the directive enter into force  It entered into force on 30 July 1985. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 30 July 1988.   background    Liability of defective products   key term    * Product  : all movable objects, even when incorporated into another movable or into an immovable object. It includes electricity, primary agricultural products (products of the soil, of stock-farming and of fisheries, excluding products which have undergone initial processing - e.g. cutting, peeling and freezing fruit and vegetables) and game.   act   Council Directive  85/374/EEC  of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products (OJ L 210, 7.8.1985, pp. 29–33)
summary of   Directive 93/51/EEC — movements of certain plant and plant-related materials through a protected zone and movements of such materials originating in and moving within such a protected zone   what is the aim of the directive   It seeks to complement  plant health rules  (currently contained in Directive 2000/29/EC) to guard against the introduction into designated  protected zones   *  of the EU of organisms harmful to plants or plant products to counter their spread. These organisms include insects, nematodes (a worm of the large phylum  Nematoda  , such as a roundworm or threadworm) and bacteria.   This directive allows EU countries to permit certain plants to be moved in or through protected zones without the need for a plant passport valid for the appropriate protected zone so long as specific  conditions  are met.   key points    EU countries may request the designation of special protection from harmful organisms for all or part of their territory. A protected zone is defined in relation to a  particular harmful organism  .   The general rules state that plants, plant products or other objects (e.g. certain types of wood or soil) which are potential carriers of harmful organisms of relevance for certain protected zones must be accompanied by a plant passport valid for the appropriate zone when introduced into or moved within that zone.   However, in respect of the movement  through a protected zone  of plants, plant products or other objects  originating outside the zone  , Directive 93/51/EEC lays down the following conditions:   the  packaging  and the  vehicles  used to transport the plants must be clean and free from the relevant organisms and be of an appropriate type to ensure there is no risk of harmful organisms spreading;   immediately after packaging and loading, the packaging or vehicle used must be  secured  so there is no risk of harmful organisms spreading in the protected zone; they must remain secured during transport;   the plant materials must be accompanied by a  document  , normally used for trade purposes, indicating that the products originate outside the protected zone and have a destination outside the protected zone.     Where an  official check  takes place and it is found that the above conditions have not been met, the packaging is sealed and the plant materials are transported under official control outside the protected zone.   Similar conditions apply to plant materials  originating in and moving within a given protected zone  . However, the official checks may be satisfied by meeting the conditions laid down in the detailed rules for surveys undertaken for the purposes of identifying protected zones (Directive  92/70/EEC  ). These detailed surveys are carried out annually and involve taking samples of plants, plant products and the growing medium in the zones in question.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 24 July 1993 and it had to become law in the EU countries by 1 June 1993 (the date referred to in Council Directive  91/683/EEC  , an act which was subsequently repealed and replaced by Council Directive  2000/29/EC  ).   background   For more information, see:    Protected zones  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Protected zone:  designated on the basis that there is danger that a particular harmful organism could become established due to favourable environmental conditions.
summary of   Directive 2008/118/EC — general arrangements for excise duty   what is the aim of the directive  It introduces arrangements for products subject to excise duty in order to guarantee their free circulation and therefore the proper functioning of the EU’s single market.   key points   This directive establishes the general arrangements for excise duties which apply to:    energy products and electricity  covered by Directive 2003/96/EC;   alcohol and alcoholic beverages covered by Directives 92/83/EEC (  EU rules for the taxation of alcohol  ) and  92/84/EEC  ;    manufactured tobacco  covered by Directive 2011/64/EU.   These products are subject to excise duties when:   they are produced, including, where applicable, their extraction, within the EU;   they are imported into the EU.   As long as they do not give rise to cross-border formalities within the EU, EU countries may also apply taxes on:   products other than excise goods;   the supply of services, including those relating to excise goods, which cannot be characterised as turnover taxes.   This directive applies to the territory of the EU with some exceptions, such as:   the Canary Islands;   the French overseas departments;   the Åland Islands;   the Channel Islands.    Chargeability, reimbursement, exemption   Excise duties are chargeable at the time of release for consumption in the EU country concerned. The person liable to pay the excise duty is generally the  authorised warehouse keeper  or the  registered consignee  .  EU countries:   may remit or refund excise duty on excise goods which have been released for consumption;   are free to fix the relevant conditions, included their tax rates, as long as   the taxes are higher than the rates set by the EU   this does not create a new class of exemption (see next paragraph).     Excise goods are  exempted  from payment of excise duty where they are intended to be used:   in the context of diplomatic or consular relations;   by international organisations;   by the armed forces of an EU country;   by the British armed forces stationed in Cyprus;   under an agreement concluded with non-EU countries or international organisations.   EU countries may also exempt from payment of excise duty excise goods supplied by  tax-free shops  which are carried in the personal luggage of travellers to a non-EU country by flight or sea-crossing.   Production, processing and holding   Each EU country sets rules concerning the production, processing and holding of excise goods. Where the excise duty has not yet been paid, these must take place in a  tax warehouse  .   Movement of excise goods under suspension of excise duty   Excise goods may be moved, under a  duty suspension arrangement  within the EU, from a tax warehouse or from a place of importation to:   another tax warehouse;   an authorised consignee;   a place of exportation from the EU; or   a beneficiary of the exemption referred to above (diplomatic or consular relations, international organisations, armed forces, etc.).   A movement of excise goods must in principle take place under cover of an  electronic administrative document  as specified in Regulation (EC) No  684/2009  , most recently amended by Regulation (EU)  2018/503  .  The competent authorities of the EU country of dispatch may ask the authorised warehouse keeper or registered consignor for a  guarantee  which covers the risks inherent in the movement under suspension of excise duty. In principle, the guarantee can be provided by another party.   Movements and taxation of excise goods after release for consumption   Excise duties on goods acquired by a private individual for his or her own personal use, and transported from one EU country to another by him or her, may be charged only in the EU country in which the goods are acquired. To determine whether the excise goods are intended for a private individual, EU countries take account of:   the commercial status of the holder of the goods;   the place where the goods are located;   any document relating to the goods;   the nature of the goods;   the quantity of the goods.   Where excise goods intended for consumption in an EU country are held for commercial purposes in another EU country, the goods are subject to the excise duties of the latter country. Excise duties paid in the first EU country may be reimbursed.  In the case of  distance selling from one EU country to another  , the vendor or his agent must pay excise duty in the EU country of destination.  EU countries may require that excise goods carry tax markings or national identification marks.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 15 January 2009 and had to become law in the EU countries by 1 January 2010.   background   For more information, see:    Common excise duty provisions  (  European Commission  ).   related document   Commission Regulation (EC) No  684/2009  of 24 July 2009 implementing Council Directive 2008/118/EC as regards the computerised procedures for the movement of excise goods under suspension of excise duty (OJ L 197, 29.7.2009, pp. 24-64)  See  consolidated version  .
   Inland navigation: harmonisation of conditions for obtaining national boatmasters'   certificates     Inland navigation: harmonisation of conditions for obtaining national boatmasters'   certificates     The aim of this Directive is to harmonise the conditions for obtaining national boat masters' certificates for inland waterway navigation between the Member States in order to combat distortions of competition between carriers and to increase the safety of inland waterway navigation.     ACT     Council Directive       96/50/EC      of 23 July 1996 on harmonizing the conditions for obtaining national boatmasters' certificates for the carriage of goods and passengers by inland waterway within the Community [Official Journal L 235 of 17.9.96]     SUMMARY     The Directive makes the same distinction as Directive       91/672/EEC      , providing for the subdivision of certificates for Community inland waterways (group B) and special certificates applicable to Community waterways and maritime areas (group A).     Scope of the Directive. The Directive applies to all boatmasters of inland-waterway vessels: self-propelled barges, tugs, pusher craft, barges, pushed convoys or side-by-side formations intended for the transport of goods or passengers, except for boatmasters of vessels for goods transport which are under 20 metres in length and vessels for passenger transport which carry no more than 12 people.     A certificate meeting the Directive's minimal requirements is valid in all Community Member States.     Requiremenents to obtain a certificate:      minimum age: 21;       conditions linked to physical and mental aptitude; a medical examination every year after reaching the age of 65 years;       at least four years' professional experience as a member of the deck crew on an inland waterway vessel, with the possibility of a reduction;       applicants must have passed an examination of professional knowledge of which the main subjects are listed in Annex II;       any special laid down by the Member States with regard to the transport of passengers;       special conditions relating to the navigation of boats with the aid of radar.      Possibility for the Commission to take the necessary steps to adapt the model boatmasters' certificate in Annex I and the professional knowledge required for the issue of the certificate specified in Annex II.

summary of   Single European Act   what is the aim of the act   The Single European Act (SEA) sought to revise the Treaties of Rome setting up the  European Economic Community (EEC)  and the  European Atomic Energy Community  .   This was in order to add new momentum to European integration and to  complete the internal market  (an area with no internal borders and in which there is free movement of goods, persons, services and capital) by 1 January 1993.   The SEA amended the rules governing the operation of the European institutions and expanded the powers of the then European Community in a number of policy areas.   By creating new Community competencies and reforming the institutions, the SEA opened the way to further political integration and  economic and monetary union  that would be enshrined in the Treaty on European Union (the  Maastricht Treaty  ).   key points    Objectives    The inter-governmental negotiations which culminated in the SEA had a dual mandate to conclude:   a Treaty relating to  common foreign and security policy  , and   an act amending the EEC Treaty, particularly with regard to:   the decision-making procedure within the Council;   the powers of the  European Commission  ;   the powers of the  European Parliament  ;   the extension of the European Economic Community and the European Atomic Energy Community's responsibilities.        Structure    The SEA consists of a  preamble and 4 titles  and includes a  series of declarations  adopted by the conference.   The  preamble  states the fundamental goals of the treaty and expresses the signatories’ determination to transform their relations as a whole with a view to creating a European Union. The preamble also establishes the unique character of the act, which brings together the common rules as regards cooperation in the field of foreign policy and the European Communities. Lastly, it focuses on the two objectives of revising the treaties, i.e. ‘to improve the economic and social situation by extending common policies and pursuing new objectives’ and ‘to ensure a smoother functioning of the Communities’.    Title I  contains rules common to political cooperation and the European Community.    Title II  is devoted to amendments of the treaties establishing the European Communities.    Title III  concerns European cooperation in the field of foreign policy.    Title IV  concerns general and final rules.      Institutional changes    To enable the creation of the single market by 1993, the SEA introduced an increased number of cases where the  Council  could take decisions by a  qualified majority  rather than by  unanimity  . This simplified decision-making and meant that the frequent delays inherent to the search for a unanimous agreement among the then 12 member countries could be avoided. Unanimity would no longer be required for laws designed to establish the single market, with the exception of measures concerning  taxation  , the  free movement of persons  and the rights and interests of employed persons.   The SEA established the  European Council  , which formalised the conferences or summits of the Heads of State or Government, although the competencies of this body were not specified until later in  Article 15 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU)  .    Parliament’s powers  were enhanced by including the requirement for its  assent  when concluding enlargement and association agreements. The SEA introduced the  cooperation procedure  , which strengthened the Parliament’s position in interinstitutional dialogue and gave it the possibility of two readings of draft laws proposed under a limited number of legal bases — thus paving the way towards Parliament’s future role as co-legislator with the Council.   The SEA clarified certain rules concerning  implementing powers  . Article 10 enabled the Council, as a general rule, to give the Commission implementing powers for the rules which the Council laid down. The Council could only reserve the right to exercise directly implementing powers in specific cases. The SEA also created the foundations for the Court of First Instance (CFI) — now the  General Court  .    Policy areas    Under the SEA, qualified majority voting became the new norm in  four of the existing areas  covered by the treaties:   the  common customs tariff  ;    free movement of capital  ;   free movement of services; and   maritime and air transport.     The SEA introduced  several new policy areas  in which decisions would be taken by qualified majority. These included:    internal market  ;    economic and social cohesion  — to counterbalance the effects of the completion of the internal market on less developed regions;    social policy  — 2 new aspects of this policy, health and safety at work and  social dialogue  between trade unions and employers;    research and development  ;    environment  — introducing the  subsidiarity principle  (i.e. only taking measures at European level where they are more effective than at the level of an individual country); and   common foreign policy — with the presidency of the Council responsible for initiating action and coordinating member countries’ positions.     from when does the act apply  The SEA applied on 1 July 1987.   background    The history of the European Union — 1980-1989  (  Europa  ).   related document   Completing the Internal Market — White Paper from the Commission to the European Council (Milan, 28-29 June 1985) (  COM(85) 310 final  , 14.6.1985)
   Green Paper on Services of General Interest     Green Paper on Services of General Interest     The aim of this Green Paper is to organise an open debate on the role of the European Union in promoting the provision of services of general interest and in defining the public interest objectives pursued by these services, and on the way in which they are organised, financed and evaluated     ACT     Commission Green Paper of 21 May 2003 on services of general interest [       COM(2003) 270      final -Official Journal C 76 of 25.03.2004].     SUMMARY     Services of general interest are at the core of the political debate. They touch on the central question of the role public authorities play in a market economy, in ensuring, on the one hand, the smooth functioning of the market and compliance with the rules of the game by all actors and, on the other hand, safeguarding the general interest, in particular the satisfaction of citizens' essential needs and the preservation of public goods where the market fails.     The reality of services of general interest in the European Union is complex and constantly evolving. It covers:      a broad range of different types of activities, from the big network industries (energy, postal services, transport and telecommunications) to health, education and social services;       the level at which these services are provided is also highly diverse, from European or even global to purely local;       the services are varied in nature, some market and some non-market;       the organisation of these services varies according to historical, geographical and cultural traditions and the characteristics of the activity concerned.      In light of this complexity, the Commission is opening a debate on the role of the European Union in defining the objectives of general interest pursued by these services and on their organisation, financing and evaluation. At the same time, the Commission confirms the significant contribution of the internal market and the competition rules to improving the quality and efficiency of many public services, for the benefit of the public and for businesses. The Green Paper also takes globalisation and liberalisation into account, and raises the issue of whether a general legal framework should be established at Community level for services of general interest.     In an effort to review fully its policy on services of general interest, the Commission asks questions concerning the following issues:      the scope of Community action on services of general interest and compliance with the principle of subsidiarity;       the Community concept of services of general interest;       the definition of good governance in the area of organisation, regulation, financing and evaluation of services of general interest in order to improve the competitiveness of the economy and ensure efficient, equitable and high-quality access to services;       any measures that could coordinate the maintenance of high-quality services of general interest and the application of competition and internal market rules.       Background      Services of general interest are one of the values shared by all European societies and form an essential element of the European model of society. Their role is essential for enhancing quality of life for all citizens and for overcoming social exclusion and isolation.     Services of general economic interest are mentioned in three different provisions:       Article 16 of the EC Treaty        , which confers responsibility on the Community and the Member States to ensure that their policies enable services of general economic interest to fulfil their missions. It establishes a principle but does not provide the Community with any specific means of action;        Article 86(2) of the EC Treaty        , which implicitly recognises the right of the Member States to assign specific public service obligations to economic operators. It sets out a fundamental principle ensuring that services of general economic interest can continue to be provided and developed in the common market. Providers of services of general interest are exempted from application of the Treaty rules only to the extent that this is strictly necessary to allow them to fulfil their general interest mission. Therefore, in the event of conflict, the fulfilment of a public service mission can effectively prevail over the application of Community rules, including internal market and competition rules;       Article 36 of the         Charter of fundamental rights of the European Union        , according to which the Union recognises and respects access to services of general economic interest in order to promote the social and territorial cohesion of the Union.      Since the second half of the 1980s a number of sectors in which services of general economic interest are provided (and are in some cases the principal type of service) have gradually been opened up to competition (e.g. telecommunications,       postal services      , transport and energy (       electricity      and       gas      )).     The European Community has always promoted "controlled" liberalisation, i.e. gradual opening-up of the market accompanied by measures to protect the general interest, in particular through the concept of universal service to guarantee access for all, whatever the economic, social or geographical situation, to a service of a specified quality at an affordable price.     The Commission has repeatedly tried to clarify the relevant Community policies:       Communications on services of general interest        [         COM(1996) 443        and         COM(2000) 580        - Official Journal C 281 of 26.09.1996 and Official Journal C 17 of 19.01.2001];       Report to the Laeken European Council, "Services of General Interest" [         COM(2001) 598        - Not published in the Official Journal].      RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, of 12 May 2004, entitled "White Paper on services of general interest" [         COM(2004) 374        final - Not yet published in the Official Journal]      The Commission has identified a number of guidelines in the area of services of general interest, in order to ensure a coherent policy in this area. This       White Paper      follows a wide-ranging public consultation, launched by a Green Paper on the role of the European Union in ensuring the provision of high-quality services of general interest to consumers and businesses in Europe. It concludes that, at present, it would not be appropriate to propose a framework directive on this subject, and suggests that the Commission re-examine the matter at a later stage.      European Parliament Resolution of 13 January 2004 on the Green Paper on services of general interest [A5-0484/2003].      The European Parliament welcomes the publication of the Commission's Green Paper and asks the Commission to present a follow-up by April 2004 at the latest. It believes that certain services of general interest should be excluded from the scope of competition rules, such as health and education, social housing and services of general interest which are intended to maintain or increase pluralism of information and cultural diversity. Parliament also asks the Commission to defend this position in negotiations within the WTO relating to the General Agreement on Trade in Services. It considers that it is neither possible nor relevant for common definitions of services of general interest, or of the public-service obligations resulting from them, to be drawn up, but that the European Union must establish common principles, such as universality and equality of access, continuity, security, adaptability, quality, efficiency, affordability, transparency, protection of disadvantaged groups, protection of users, consumers and the environment, and participation of citizens, taking into account circumstances specific to each sector. Parliament also stresses the need to ensure that competition rules are compatible with public-service obligations and states clearly that it is against the liberalisation of water supply. Parliament believes that water and waste services should not be subject to EU sectoral directives but stresses that the Union should retain full responsibility for these sectors as regards quality and environment protection standards.

summary of   Decision 2002/494/JHA – network of contact points on genocide, crimes against humanity and war crime issues   summary    what does this decision do  It establishes a network of national contact points (one in each EU country) for improving cooperation in combating genocide*, crimes against humanity*, and war crimes*.   key points         —     National contact points for exchanging information on investigations of such crimes are established in each EU country. The details of each contact point must be sent to the  General Secretariat of the Council of the EU  , which then forwards the information to the national contact points in other EU countries.            —     National contact points provide each other with information relevant to investigations into genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes upon request from other national contact points.            —     The Council of the EU annually briefs the  European Parliament  on the activities of the network of contact points.            —     The network meets twice a year at meetings convened by the  Presidency of the Council of the EU  to coordinate on-going efforts to investigate and prosecute persons suspected of having committed or participated in genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.      from when does the decision apply  It entered into force on 13 June 2002.   background   All EU countries ratified the  Rome Statute of 17 July 1998  setting up the  International Criminal Court  (ICC) to hear cases involving genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.  However, the investigation and prosecution of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes are primarily the responsibilities of national authorities. This is why closer cooperation between national authorities is needed to ensure these crimes are combated successfully.        —      Genocide Network       key terms    * Genocide  : acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group.   * Crimes against humanity  : acts committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against civilian populations.   * War crimes  : acts committed that violate the law of war (e.g. the Geneva Conventions). Examples include mistreating prisoners-of-war, killing hostages, or deliberately destroying cities, towns or villages.   act   Council Decision  2002/494/JHA  of 13 June 2002 setting up a European network of contact points in respect of persons responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes (OJ L 167, 26.6.2002, pp. 1–2)
summary of   European Commission communication (COM(2007) 424 final) – ways to deal with gender-based pay differences   summary    what does this communication do  It examines the reasons women persistently tend to be paid less than men and puts forward possible ways to tackle this discrimination.   key points    The pay gap* can reflect objective differences such as age and experience. But it is also linked to various legal, social and economic factors, such as how jobs are valued.   The pay gap is wider than average in private sector companies. It increases with the size of the business and a person's age, level of education and length of service.   The communication identifies 4 ways to reduce pay discrimination:   Improve the application of existing European legislation and use information campaigns to stress respect for the  principle of equal pay for work of equal value  ,   Exploit to the full the  Europe 2020 strategy  for growth and jobs, which includes reducing the pay gap among its aims,   Encourage employers in both the public and private sectors to implement equal pay,   Exchange examples of good practice at all levels of government.     Directive  2006/54/EC  provides for equal employment conditions for men and women, including pay.   Recommendation  2014/124/EU  advises national governments how to better implement the equal pay principle. The guidance includes:   right of employees to have information on pay levels,   regular reports on average pay levels by companies with over 50 employees,   nationally organised pay audits for companies and organisations with over 250 employees,   up-to-date data on the gender pay gap.     background   The fundamental principle of equal treatment between men and women goes back to the very beginnings of the European Union. It is enshrined in the Treaty on European Union (Articles  2  and  3(3)  ), the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (Articles  8  ,  10  and  157(1)  ), the  Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union  (Article 23) and is 1 of 5 priorities in the  Women's Charter  .   key term    * Pay gap  : this measures the relative difference in the average gross hourly earnings of men and women in the economy as a whole.   act   Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - Tackling the pay gap between women and men (  COM(2007) 424 final  of 18.7.2007)

Based in Brussels, the holder of the post:      acts with complete independence;       treats all confidential information with professional secrecy;       monitors how EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies apply the legislation;       promotes public understanding and awareness of the processing of personal data;       handles complaints and conducts investigations;       warns and sanctions data controllers;       refers issues to the Court of Justice, which handles any disputes over the legislation;       submits an annual report to the         European Parliament        , the         Council        and the         European Commission        ;       cooperates with national data protection supervisory authorities.       EDPS rules of procedure      A       decision      of 15 May 2020 adopts the rules of procedure of the EDPS. It lays down in detail:      the EDPS’s mission, guiding principles and organisation;       how it will monitor and ensure the application of the regulation;       procedures for its legislative consultation, technology monitoring, research projects and court proceedings; and       procedures for cooperation with national supervisory authorities and international cooperation.       Special rules for EU bodies, offices and agencies       Special rules      apply to EU bodies, offices and agencies that process operational personal data       *      for the purposes of law enforcement (e.g.       Eurojust      ). They are covered by a specific chapter in the regulation. The rules in this chapter are aligned with the LED. Moreover, in the founding acts of these bodies, offices and agencies, more specific rules can be laid down to take into account their particular characteristics.       Europol      and the       European Public Prosecutor’s Office      are excluded from the regulation. The Commission will review the legislative framework for EU bodies, offices and agencies that process operational data for the purposes of law enforcement by April 2022.      Data protection officers      Controllers also appoint a       data protection officer      for a 3- to 5-year term to:      give independent advice on personal data processing;       monitor compliance with the data protection rules.       Reports      The Commission must report to the European Parliament and to the Council no later than 30 April 2022 – and every 5 years thereafter – on how the legislation is being applied.     FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?     It has applied since 11 December 2018, except with regard to the processing of personal data by Eurojust, where it has applied from 12 December 2019.     BACKGROUND      Article 8      of the       Charter of Fundamental Rights      states that everyone has the right to personal data protection.       Article 16      of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU further develops that right. This article is the legal basis for any EU legislation on data protection.

summary of   Regulation (EU) No 1008/2010 — type-approval requirements for windscreen wiper and washer systems of certain motor vehicles   what is the aim of the regulation   It lays down rules concerning windscreen wiper  *  and washer systems  *  of motor vehicles.   The aim is to adapt current requirements to developments in scientific and technical knowledge.   key points   The regulation establishes type-approval requirements for windscreen wiper and washer systems of motor vehicles. It forms part of the implementation of the  Regulation (EC) No 661/2009  on type-approval requirements for the safety of motor vehicles.   Type of vehicle concerned   This regulation applies to vehicles of category M1, i.e. vehicles designed and built for passenger transport, seating not more than 8 passengers in addition to the driver.   Requirements concerning windscreen wipers and washer systems   Manufacturers must equip motor vehicles with:    windscreen wipers  consisting of wiper arms. The windscreen wiper system must have at least 2 sweep frequency settings. The windscreen wiper field must cover at least 98 % of vision area A and 80 % of vision area B (these areas are defined in paragraphs 2.2 and 2.4 respectively of Annex 18 of  UNECE Regulation No 43  );    washer system  to spray fluid onto the target area of the windscreen without any leakage, disconnection of any tubing or malfunctioning of any nozzle. This system must deliver sufficient fluid to clear at least 60 % of vision area A.   The regulation also establishes test procedures to check compliance of devices.   Applyingfor EUtype-approval   The vehicle manufacturer must submit an application for type-approval to the competent authority. The manufacturer has 2 options:   to submit an application for type-approval for each type of vehicle concerning its windscreen wiper and washer systems; or   to submit an application for type-approval, as a technical unit, for a type of windscreen washer system.   The EU application must contain the following information:   the make and type of vehicle;   a detailed technical description of the wiper and washer system;   a description of the method of operation of the wiper and washer systems.   If the competent authority considers that the vehicle satisfies all of the requirements concerning windscreen wiper and washer systems, it grants EU type-approval and issues a type-approval number in line with  Directive 2007/46/EC  .   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 30 November 2010.   * key terms     Windscreen wiper system:  a system for wiping the outer face of the windscreen.     Windscreen washer system:  a system for storing, transferring and aiming fluid towards the outer face of the windscreen.
act   Decision No  585/2014/EU  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on the deployment of the interoperable EU-wide eCall service.   summary   This decision calls on EU countries to deploy the  eCall  (in-vehicle emergency call system) infrastructure necessary for handling all eCalls in the EU by 1 October 2017 at the latest.  Specifically, the decision sets a deployment deadline of at least 6 months before the date of application of the  regulation on the mandatory fitting of the eCall device in vehicles  (personal cars and commercial light vehicles).  eCall infrastructure includes call centres, or  PSAPs  (public safety answering points), which will receive and handle eCalls using the European single emergency number 112.  The decision also recognises the right of each EU country to:   organise its eCall services in a way that is most cost effective and appropriate to its needs, for example rejecting any non-emergency calls coming into its PSAPs;   allow nationally recognised private organisations to deal with the receipt and handling of eCalls.    Data and privacy protection   EU countries must also ensure that:   data transmitted via the eCall service are only used to reach the goals of this decision (e.g. not be used for tracking a vehicle outside of emergencies);   eCalls are handled free of charge for service users across the EU;   they provide to the European Commission, by 24 December 2015, a status report on their implementation of this decision: for example a list of the authorities overseeing eCall PSAPs, a list and geographical coverage of PSAPs, a description of conformance tests and a description of the privacy and protection protocols;   eCalls can be made anywhere on their territory, as long as there is at least one public mobile wireless communications network available.   This decision enters into force on 23 June 2014.   What is eCall?   eCall automatically dials 112 in the event of a serious road accident and communicates the vehicle’s location to the emergency services. The system can also be triggered manually.  eCalls should speed up emergency response times by up to 60 % in urban areas and by 50 % in rural ones, saving hundreds of lives in Europe every year. It will also reduce the severity of injuries caused by road accidents in tens of thousands of cases and cut the costs of traffic congestion.  Road accidents in the EU caused 28 000 deaths and left 1.5 million injured in 2012.

   Bathing water quality (until 2014)     Bathing water quality (until 2014)     The European Union (EU) lays down rules for the monitoring, assessment and management of the quality of bathing water and for the provision of information on that quality. The aim is twofold, to reduce and prevent the pollution of bathing water, and to inform European citizens of the degree of pollution.     ACT     Council Directive       76/160/EEC      of 8 December 1975 concerning the quality of bathing water [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     This Directive concerns the quality of bathing water in the Member States of the European Union (EU). It concerns those waters in which bathing is authorised by the national authorities and regularly practised by a significant number of bathers. This Directive does not apply to water intended for therapeutic purposes, or to water used in swimming pools.     It lays down the       minimum quality criteria      to be met by bathing water. They relate to:      the limit values of substances considered to be indicators of pollution (in the Annex);       the minimum sampling frequency and method of analysis or inspection of such water (in the Annex).      Member States may fix       more stringent values      than the criteria laid down in the Directive. In addition, where it does not give any values for certain substances, Member States are not obliged to fix any.      Water quality assessment      Sampling is carried out by Member States at different intervals for each polluting substance (in the Annex). Samples are taken at places where the daily average density of bathers is highest. Sampling begins two weeks before the start of the bathing season. The water testing must be adapted to the geographical and topographical conditions and to the presence of existing or potential polluting discharges.      Non-compliance      Where the waters do not conform to the parameters of the Directive, Member States may not authorise bathing in them before they have taken the necessary measures to improve the water quality. They have a period of ten years after notification of the Directive for the quality of the water to conform to the set limit values.     However, under certain conditions, bathing water is deemed to conform to the relevant parameters, even if a certain percentage of samples taken during the bathing season do not conform to the limit values.       Derogations to the Directive      are possible, provided that they meet the objective of protecting public health.     In addition, the consequences of floods, natural disasters or abnormal weather conditions are not taken into consideration when determining the water quality.      Monitoring Committee      A Committee on       adaptation to technical progress      enables the measures for improving water quality to be adapted. It consists of representatives from the Member States and is chaired by a representative of the Commission.      Context      This is repealed by       Directive 2006/7/EC      with effect from 31 December 2014. However, it still applies in Member States where transposition of the new Directive is not finished.

   Interoperability of the conventional rail system     Interoperability of the conventional rail system     Integration and harmonisation of the technical standards applying to conventional rail systems enables people and goods to move around more easily, thus promoting the railways as a mode of transport in Europe.     ACT     Directive       2001/16/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 March 2001 on the interoperability of the conventional rail system [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     This Directive concerns railway systems and deals with the following areas:      the essential requirements to be met by the system;       the technical specifications for interoperability (TSIs), which have to be adopted in accordance with the procedures laid down by the Directive;       all the other European specifications, including European standards from the European standards bodies: CEN, Cenelec and ETSI.      The full extent and complexity of the trans-European conventional rail network is taken into account. In terms of interoperability, the infrastructure, fixed equipment, logistics systems and rolling stock and the components thereof all play a critical role.     For operating purposes, the overall system is divided into subsystems:      infrastructure;       energy;       maintenance;       control and command and signalling;       rolling stock;       traffic operation and management;       telematic applications for passenger and freight services.      Since it was established in 2004, the       European Railway Agency européenne      has been responsible for drawing up and revising TSIs. The social partners and representatives of users are consulted.     The Directive stipulates that work on common standards should focus first on control and command and signalling, telematic applications for freight services, traffic operation and management (including staff qualifications), freight wagons and noise problems.     After it was revised in 2004, the scope of the Directive was extended to include the entire European conventional railway network in order to supplement the Directive on the       high-speed network      . It also establishes the conditions that must be met to achieve the interoperability of the trans-European railway network within the Community.     These conditions concern the design, construction, placing in service, upgrading, renewal, operation and maintenance of the parts of this system placed in service after the entry into force of the Directive, as well as the qualifications and health and safety conditions of the staff who contribute to its operation.      Background      This Directive was designed on the basis of the structure and content of the High-Speed Directive. It was amended and supplemented in 2004 in accordance with the Directive on the       interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system      . This new impetus is part of a strategy to revitalise rail transport in Europe and help combat the harmful effects caused by excessive use of road transport.

summary of   Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU)    Article 153 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)    Recommendation 2013/112/EU on investing in children   what are the aims of the recommendation, article 3 (teu) and article 153 (tfeu)  As part of its  social investment package for growth and cohesion (SIP)  , the European Commission adopted a recommendation on child-friendly social investment. Its aim is to provide EU countries with guidance on how to tackle child poverty and promote children’s well-being, as well as to find common ways of tackling these challenges.  Article 3 of the TEU specifically mentions the protection of the rights of the child as being among the EU’s aims and values.  Article 153 of the TFEU lists the areas of social policy in which the EU supports and complements EU countries’ own activities. These areas include fighting social exclusion.   key points   The recommendation calls for a  children’s rights approach  and for  integrated strategies  based on 3 pillars.     1.     Access to adequate resources  to reduce income poverty and material deprivation by:   supporting parents’ participation in the labour market and making sure that their work ‘pays’;   providing for adequate living standards through a combination of child and family benefits, which should be redistributived across income groups but avoid inactivity traps and stigmatisation.        2.     Access to affordable quality services  to increase children’s life chances and improve their development by:   improving access to affordable early childhood education and care services to reduce inequality at a young age;   improving education systems’ impact on equal opportunities by ensuring all children receive inclusive high-quality education;   improving the responsiveness of health systems to address the needs of disadvantaged children;   providing children with a safe, adequate housing and living environment;   enhancing family support and the quality of alternative care settings.        3.     Children’s right to participate  by:   supporting the participation of all children in play, recreation, sport and cultural activities — informal learning opportunities outside the school context;   putting in place mechanisms that promote children’s participation in decision-making that affects their lives.      In addition, the Commission calls for developing  governance, implementation and monitoring arrangements  by:   strengthening synergies across sectors;   enhancing the use of evidence-based policy development and social policy innovation.   Lastly, the recommendation stresses that  full use of the relevant EU instruments  needs to be made by:   mobilising the range of  tools and indicators  available within the Europe 2020 strategy to give new impetus to joint efforts to address child poverty and social exclusion; and   making appropriate use of the opportunities provided by  EU financial instruments  to support the policy priorities outlined above.   background   For more information, see:    Investing in children  (  European Commission  ).   main documents   Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union — Title I — Common provisions —  Article 3  (ex Article 2 TEU) (OJ C 202, 7.6.2016, p. 17)  Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union — Part Three — Union policies and Internal actions — Title X — Social policy —  Article 153  (ex Article 137 TEC) (OJ C 202, 7.6.2016, pp. 114-116)  Commission Recommendation  2013/112/EU  of 20 February 2013: Investing in children: breaking the cycle of disadvantage (OJ L 59, 2.3.2013, pp. 5-16)
   Use of security scanners at EU airports     Use of security scanners at EU airports     The use of security scanners at European Union (EU) airports is currently regulated at a national level. This communication examines a harmonised approach to the use of security scanners and discusses the key issues and concerns associated with their introduction as a measure for screening persons at EU airports. Differing standards within the EU risks fragmenting the fundamental rights of EU citizens, impeding their rights of free movement and escalating their health concerns related to new security technologies.     ACT     Commission Communication to the European Parliament and the Council of 15 June 2010 on the Use of Security Scanners at EU airports [       COM(2010) 311      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The aim of European Union (EU) policy on aviation security is to protect persons and goods from acts of unlawful interference to civil aviation. Following the attacks of 11 September 2001 the EU established a       common aviation security      framework. One of its key elements is that every passenger and every piece of luggage or cargo departing from an EU airport must be screened or otherwise controlled in order to ensure that no prohibited article is being brought into security restricted areas of airports and on board aircraft. Over the past years civil aviation has been facing new types of threats, as shown more recently by the attempted terrorist attack of 25 December 2009 involving explosives concealed on a passenger on a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit, against which the traditional security technologies currently deployed at airports are not fully effective.      Concerns related to the use of security scanners      Over the past years, the concerns raised on the use of security scanners predominantly relate to the creation of       body images      and the use of       X-ray (ionising) radiation      . These concerns have initiated a fierce debate on the compliance of security scanners with EU fundamental rights and public health principles.       Fundamental rights      are primarily protected by the       Charter of Fundamental Rights      of the European Union. Any adoption of measures restricting these rights must be justified for reasons of general public interest (in this instance aviation security) and must respect the principles of necessity, legality and proportionality. In relation to the deployment of security scanners, concerns have been raised as regards the possible impact on human dignity, privacy and protection of personal data, religious beliefs and non-discrimination. With regards to       health      concerns, the EU legislation and the       Euratom Treaty      set principles and thresholds for radiation doses. In particular, the Euratom legislation requires legitimate justification for human exposure to X-ray radiation. Since the effects of X-ray radiation on health are well known, limited exposure of human beings to X-ray radiation for medical and non-medical use must be in compliance with EU legislation principles. Today security scanner technologies exist that neither produce full body images nor emit ionising radiation.     Currently, under the EU legal framework for aviation security, EU countries must choose from a given list which methods and technologies they use to screen persons. The existing legislation does not allow airports to       systematically      replace any of the recognised screening methods and technologies with security scanners. A decision from the Commission, supported by EU countries and the European Parliament, is needed to allow security scanners to be considered a method to screen persons for aviation security purposes. EU countries may, however, introduce security scanners for temporary airport trials or as a       more stringent security measure      than existing EU legislation requires. At the time of this communication, security scanners are known to have been tested in Finland, France, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK.     Security scanners alone, like any other single security measure, cannot completely guarantee aviation security. Nevertheless, on-going tests have demonstrated that security scanners can improve the quality of security controls at EU airports. They could significantly increase the detection capacity of prohibited items such as liquid or plastic explosives which cannot be detected by walk-through metal detectors. Only a       common EU approach      to the use of security scanners would legally guarantee uniform application of security rules and standards in all EU airports. This is essential to ensure both the highest level of aviation security as well as the best possible protection of EU citizens' fundamental rights and health.      Background      In 2008, the Commission proposed a draft regulation with basic screening requirements which provided a list of recognised screening methods and technologies, including security scanners. The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the impact of aviation security measures and body scanners on human rights, privacy, personal dignity and data protection, requesting a more in-depth assessment of the situation. The Commission agreed to review these matters further and withdrew security scanners from its original legislative proposal. The draft legislation became Commission Regulation (EC) No       272/2009      .     The Commission will decide next steps to take, including whether or not to propose an EU legal framework on the use of security scanners at EU airports, following an impact assessment further analysing the possible impact of the deployment of security scanners on fundamental rights and health and in the light of the outcome of discussions with the European Parliament.

summary   As the EU bank, the  European Investment Bank  (EIB) provides finance and expertise for sound and sustainable investment projects in Europe and beyond. Owned by the 28 EU countries, the projects it supports contribute to furthering EU policy objectives. The bank’s priorities going forward are reflected in the  corporate operational plan 2015-2017  .   what does the operational plan 2015-2017 do  Approved in April 2015, it details how the EIB plans to best use its resources to fund projects, including support provided under the  investment plan for Europe  , expected to be underwritten by an additional guarantee from the EU budget.   key points    Investing to restore EU competitiveness   The EIB remains well placed to support investment growth, reinforce economic and social cohesion, sustain employment and play a critical role in restoring EU competitiveness.  It continues to be very responsive to the economic environment and prove its role as the EU bank. This was underlined with the €10 billion capital increase approved in 2012. This enables additional financing of viable investment projects in the range of €180 billion between 2013 and 2015 across the EU, with a focus on projects aiming at sustainable long-term growth and employment. The EIB is on track to deliver, and even exceed, these objectives and intends to continue in its important catalytic role to resolve the EU’s current investment and competitiveness challenges.  The EIB plans to maintain significant lending volumes throughout the 2015-2017 period, including sizeable anti-cyclical contributions to support investment activities in the EU.  Outside the EU, the bank will stay firmly engaged to support EU policy and continue to promote private sector-led growth, both by supporting access to finance for SMEs and much needed economic and social infrastructure and by providing advice and technical assistance.   A strategic partnership between the EIB and the European Commission   The  European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI)  is a strategic partnership between the European Commission and the EIB, deployed by the EIB Group (EIB and  European Investment Fund — EIF  ), to address market failure by helping reduce the risk inherent in projects to encourage further investment.  The EIB will contribute €5 billion to the new initiative, alongside a €16 billion guarantee from the EU budget. This will allow EFSI to unlock additional investment of at least €315 billion over the 2015-2017 period.   The value of lending   The EIB lends to public sector bodies and private companies. To receive support the project must further EU objectives and be economically, technically, financially and environmentally sound.   background   Created in 1958, the EIB is the EU bank for long-term loans. In 1994, the EIF was set up to support the development of high-growth small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and/or those active in new technologies. The EIB is the majority shareholder and operator of the EIF. In 2000, the EIB Group was created, consisting of the EIB and the EIF. Within the Group, the EIB grants medium and long-term bank loans, while the EIF specialises in venture-capital operations and providing guarantees for SMEs.        —      European Investment Bank             —      European Investment Fund             —      Investment Plan for Europe       act   European Investment Bank Group:  operational plan 2015-2017  , 8 May 2015

   Turkey – Employment and social policy     Turkey – Employment and social policy     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM (2011) 666      final – SEC(2011) 1201 – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The       2011 Report      notes limited progress in the area of employment and social policy. Although constitutional changes have been made, the granting of full trade union rights is still not guaranteed. Undeclared work and that of women remain a source for concern.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission’s words)      The       acquis      in the social field includes minimum standards in areas such as labour law, equal treatment of women and men, health and safety at work and anti-discrimination. The European Social Fund (ESF) is the main financial tool through which the EU supports the implementation of its Employment Strategy and contributes to social inclusion efforts in the fight against social exclusion (implementation rules are covered under Chapter 22, which deals with all structural instruments). The Member States participate in social dialogue at European level and in EU policy processes in the areas of employment policy, social inclusion and social protection.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      Turkey made limited progress in the field of       social policy and employment      . Administrative capacity showed some improvement. Constitutional amendments regarding trade union rights have not resulted in further changes of the legislation aimed at granting full trade union rights in line with EU standards and ILO conventions. The reduction of large-scale undeclared work and the increase of female employment rates are still matters of concern. The scope of the labour law remains limited. Enforcement of health and safety at work legislation needs to be stepped up. The risk of poverty remains very high, especially for the rural population and for children. Legislation establishing an equality body has not yet been adopted.     RELATED ACTS      Commission Report [         COM(2010) 660        final – SEC(2010) 1327 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2010 Report highlighted the progress made by Turkey in the field of social policy and employment. However, alignment with the European social       acquis      remained limited. Reforms needed to continue in the areas of health and safety at work, trade union law and the fight against poverty.      Commission Report [         COM(2009) 533        final – SEC(2009) 1334 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2009 Report noted limited progress. The legislation on labour law, discrimination, health and safety at work had not yet been aligned with European standards. However, there had been good progress on the preparations for the introduction of the European Social Fund in the country. The establishment of the Parliamentary Commission on Equal Opportunities for Men and Women also constituted progress. The country had to take appropriate action to reduce unemployment and to combat poverty.

act   Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the EU approach against wildlife trafficking (  COM(2014) 64 final  of 7.2.2014).   summary    what does this communication do  It appraises the current situation and assesses the EU’s measures to fight against wildlife trafficking both at global level and within the EU. It also serves to launch a debate on the EU’s future approach to wildlife trafficking.   key points   A wide body of rules exists both at global level and within the EU to regulate the wildlife trade.  The EU has given its support to a range of initiatives against wildlife trafficking such as the  Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species  (CITES), its  forest law enforcement, governance and trade action plan  and  timber regulation  (to ensure the legal origin and traceability of timber products) and the fight against  illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing  .  These rules have not, however, prevented the recent surge in wildlife trafficking, which is driven by increasing demand and by poverty and poor governance in source countries.  Issues identified include:   weak or no enforcement of the rules (low political priority and insufficient resources);   poor awareness of the scale of the problem;   the involvement of organised crime, which requires the coordinated response of actors and measures.   A coordinated and comprehensive approach therefore needs to be taken to deal with both the  demand and supply  sides of the wildlife trafficking equation. This must involve actors in a variety of policy areas.  The paper invited interested parties to provide their views, by 10 April 2014, on aspects such as:   whether the EU’s current policy and legal framework is adequate;   whether the EU needs to develop an action plan in the field;   what tools at international level would improve enforcement and governance;   the respective roles of civil society and the private sector;   how to address the peace and security aspects of wildlife trafficking (given that certain conflicts are over natural resources, such as  ivory  and rhino horn);   how to help capacity building in wildlife conservation in developing countries;   how to improve data on wildlife crime in the EU and harness the tools used against organised crime to address wildlife trafficking.   next steps   The responses to the above questions served to assist the European Commission in its review of current EU policy and measures with a view to arming it to deal more effectively with the situation. They are summarised in a  Commission staff working document  . The Commission has started work on an EU action plan against wildlife trafficking.

summary of   Regulation (EU) No 978/2012 applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences   what is the aim of the regulation   In 2012, the European Union (EU) agreed new rules to refocus this scheme, which has been in place since 1971. They make the system  more transparent and predictable  for beneficiary countries, especially in view of the changed global trade patterns over the past decade. The scheme is now directed at  those countries in greatest need  .   The regulation does not include countries that already enjoy preferences under free trade agreements with the EU, or under ‘autonomous’ arrangements with the bloc (usually temporary, pending the conclusion of more comprehensive, longer-term agreements with the EU).   key points   The EU’s scheme of generalised tariff preferences (GSP) allows developing countries to pay lower tariffs on their exports to the EU. This helps boost their economies.   3 strands of the scheme     standard GSP  – tariffs for goods imported from a developing country are reduced or suspended.  Exception  – this does not apply if a country has been classified by the World Bank as a high or upper-middle income country for 3 consecutive years immediately before the EU updates the list of beneficiary countries    GSP+ (incentive scheme)  – even lower tariffs for countries which ratify and implement 27 specified international conventions covering human and labour rights, environment and good governance.    EBA (Everything But Arms), for least-developed countries  – full tariff and quota-free imports for all goods from the  UN-defined least developed countries (LDCs)  , except for arms.    Suspension of countries   The EU may temporarily suspend the lower tariffs for reasons such as:    violations of core principles  in human and labour rights conventions    unfair trading practices     serious shortcomings in customs controls  (e.g. export or transit of illegal drugs)   if the national law of a GSP+ beneficiary country  no longer incorporates the relevant conventions  (or that law is not effectively implemented).    Discontinuation as countries develop    Some countries can be poor but still develop highly competitive export industries. Once this happens, they no longer need preferences to successfully penetrate EU markets.   The GSP scheme therefore  withdraws preferences  from countries with such competitive product sectors on the basis of a ‘graduation’ mechanism.    More stable & predictable    The new GSP, because it lasts 10 years (it was 3 in the past), offers importers and exporters more stability and predictability.   Exporters know that, where changes are made in the beneficiaries’ list, there are transition periods of at least 1 year. Countries now have the security of knowing that they can be removed from the beneficiary lists only if the UN lists them as high or upper-middle income 3 years in a row.    Temporary import restrictions   The EU may apply  safeguard measures  (temporary restrictions) if imports from beneficiary countries cause or threaten to cause ‘serious difficulty’ to an EU producer. It may also apply surveillance measures for farm products. None of these measures has ever been taken in the history of the scheme.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 20 November 2012.   background   For more information, see:    ‘Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP)’  on the European Commission's website.
summary of   Regulation (EU) No 1260/2012 — translation arrangements for the unitary patent   what is the aim of the regulation  It establishes the translation arrangements for the 26 EU countries that signed up to the European patent with unitary effect (known as the ‘  unitary patent  ’).   key points   A unitary patent which has been published in 1 of the 3 official languages of the  European Patent Office (EPO)  – English, French and German – and for which the claims have been translated into the other two, in accordance with Article 14(6) of the European Patent Convention, does not need to be translated into other official EU languages.  A patent holder, suspecting an infringement of their patent, must:   provide, at the alleged infringer’s request, a full translation of the patent into the official language of the EU country where the alleged offence took place or the alleged infringer lives;   provide a full translation of the patent into the official language of courts in other European unitary patent countries which may become involved in the legal proceedings;   pay the translation costs involved.   Courts, required to assess damages in a dispute, must consider whether the alleged infringer is:   a  small or medium-sized enterprise (SME)  ,   a natural person or non-profit organisation,   a university or public research organisation.   They must also consider whether the alleged infringer acted unintentionally.  A compensation scheme:   helps reimburse, up to a set ceiling, the translation costs for patent applications filed in an official EU language other than 1 of the 3 official EPO languages;   is funded by patent renewal and late payment fees;   is available only to SMEs, natural people, non-profit organisations, universities and public research organisations whose residence or principal business location is in an EU country.   Transitional measures state during 6 years as of the date of entry into application of that regulation:   unitary patent applications lodged in French or German must be translated into English and those lodged in English into any other official EU language;   an independent expert committee, 6 years after the date of application and then every 2 years, must evaluate the ability of high-quality machines to translate patent applications and specifications;   the  European Commission  must present a report to EU governments on the basis of the committee’s first and subsequent evaluations.   from when does the regulation apply  The regulation will apply four months after the deposit of the 13th instrument of ratification of the Unified Patent Court Agreement (provided this includes the 3 countries in which the highest number of European patents have effect — Germany, France and the United Kingdom (   1   )) to the  Secretariat of the EU Council  .   background   Decision  2011/167/EU  authorised the 25 countries to use the EU procedure of  enhanced cooperation  to work together in creating unitary patent protection. Spain and Italy decided to stay out of the scheme.  A single application to the European Patent Office makes it possible to secure patent protection in up to 26 EU countries. This simplifies procedures and reduces costs for applicants wishing to protect their inventions.

summary   Many of the systems and services that are today essential for Europeans' well-being and security depend directly or indirectly on space. They rely on space technologies when using their mobile phones, making financial transactions, taking a plane, watching the weather forecast or looking for the nearest restaurant using car navigation system. Space has become part of their daily lives. The Commission therefore proposes  a new space policy  to meet the challenges of today's world.  Europe's space industry is a driver for growth and innovation and a highly strategic sector, helping citizens face both societal challenges and create innovative technologies and services.   Commercial and innovation challenges:    Across the world, the space industry is highly subsidized through institutional programmes which translate into financing of research and development (R&D) programmes and purchasing of space products and services. Total European R&D is roughly estimated to account for 10% of unconsolidated sales turnover of the EU space sector. In an international context, the funding of European R&D is relatively small. The European institutional market is relatively small - in 2009, the US budget was almost 10 times higher than the European budget - and very fragmented, due to the diversity of public stakeholders and their different and not always coordinated industrial policies.   The satellite communications (SatCom) industry is instrumental in sustaining the entire European space industry. This segment's sales account for more than 60% of the European space manufacturing industry over the last ten years. Although Europe can count on a world-class SatCom industry, this sector faces not only increasing global competition but also technical and political challenges due to the scarcity of the radio spectrum.   Europe needs to position itself in the emerging markets for navigation (SatNav) and Earth observation applications (SatEO), services and products. These service industries have a high potential for growth and job creation. However, the development of the European satellite-based services industry is currently challenged by the existing regulatory framework and insufficient support to start-up companies which are at the heart of services and applications development.   To address these challenges, Europe should achieve  technological non-dependence, security of supply  and maintain  independent access to space  .  The new space communication identifies the main challenges the European space industry faces and proposes a series of measures to help it become more competitive at global level.  A  press release  summarises the key points of the communication.

   Language use in consumer information     Language use in consumer information     Language use is dealt with in various provisions of Community law. These provisions can be very strict, for example when it comes to potentially dangerous products. The legislation on language use aims to inform consumers properly and promote multilingual information, whilst guaranteeing Member States' freedom in language matters.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament, of 10 November 1993, concerning language use in the information of consumers in the Community [       COM(93) 456      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     In this Communication, the Commission points out that consumers have a right to information on the qualities and characteristics of products and services on the market.     The Communication surveys existing national and Community legislation relating to language requirements in the field of consumer information. Areas covered are:      labelling;       instructions for use;       assembly instructions;       precautions regarding employment or use;       any warning intended for the final user of the product or service.      In addition, the Communication puts forward a number of ideas for strengthening consumer information.     Depending on the subject matter in question and the objectives envisaged, the provisions of existing Community legislation are very diverse. In some cases the wording explicitly specifies the use of languages. This is the case with wine, the placing on the market of medicinal products, and tobacco labelling. In other cases the wording requires Member States to lay down rules. This is the case with       foodstuffs labelling      and       nutrition labelling      , which must be provided in a language "easily understood" by the buyer. In some cases the question of languages is not mentioned at all (e.g.       misleading advertising      ,       consumer credit      ), or it is left up to Member States to impose language requirements (e.g.       toy safety      ,       cosmetic products      ).     While some attempt at harmonisation has been made in the technical harmonisation directives concerning certain industrial products, there does not seem to have been a systematic approach in Community legislation as regards language use. This can sometimes lead to problems of interpretation, notably when references are made to a "language easily understood" by the consumer.     This absence of consistency is partly due to the variety of domains covered (foodstuffs, cosmetic products, package holidays, toy safety, financial services, etc). It is also due to the limits laid down in the EEC Treaty, since the provisions concerning language requirements may be considered a barrier to the free movement of products or services. A balance therefore needs to be found between the safeguarding of free movement and the safety and health of consumers. A simplification of the Community provisions relating to language requirements is also desirable.     The approaches adopted by the Member States are varied, since language problems are not identical in all Member States. However, more than half of the Member States have considered it necessary to inform the consumer in his own language.     On the other hand, in cases where Community legislation gives Member States the option of stipulating language requirements in favour of consumers, this option is generally not very well taken up.     The Communication emphasises that information which is difficult to understand or read may have serious repercussions for the health or safety of the consumer. Foodstuffs are a good example: in the case of       persons with allergies      or diabetes or restricted to a       particular diet      , failure to understand the labelling may have serious health consequences. Similarly, an incomplete translation of operating instructions can make the       use of electrical appliances      dangerous.     The Communication also points out that all consumer categories are concerned, including children, who may not necessarily know foreign languages.     The analysis presented in the Communication leads the Commission to propose a balanced approach, and one which must take into account:      the competence of the Member States in defining national rules in this domain;       the rules of the Treaty on European Union and the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Community(CJEC);       the legitimate right of consumers to receive the most exhaustive possible information on the products and services offered to them.      In the context of this new approach, the Commission proposes the following five themes for discussion:      encourage multilingual information;       preserve the freedom of Member States to require use of the language of the country of consumption;       improve the consistency of the Community legal instruments in regard to the use of languages in the domain of consumption;       improve information of the Commission, the Member States and the operators on the applicable language rules;       assign responsibility to the economic operators (producers, distributors).       Case law      The Community legislator encourages the use of multilingual information, in accordance with the case law (see the judgment in the "Peeters" case for the marketing of foodstuffs and case C-33/97/2 on the labelling of goods).     It also takes the view that the national law of a Member State must allow the use of a foreign expression on a product label if this informs consumers better or if the term in question exists only in the language of origin (Answer of 20 January 2003 given by Frits Bolkestein on behalf of the Commission to written question P-3785/02 from Bruno Gollnish MEP).     RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social committee and the Committee of the Regions - A New Framework Strategy for Multilingualism [         COM(2005) 596        final] - Not published in the Official Journal].      This is the Commission's first communication on multilingualism. The aim of this policy is to give citizens access to European Union (EU) legislation, procedures and information in their own languages. The communication also proposes measures to encourage language learning and promote linguistic diversity in society. A labour force with better language skills will help the development of the economy, as workers will be able to work or study in other Member States more easily.      Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council -Annual Policy Strategy for 2005 [         COM(2004) 0133        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      The arrival of 10 new Member States in May 2004 will entail a great deal of effort from the European Union from a linguistic point of view to ensure that these countries' citizens are properly informed. This will have considerable budgetary impact. For example, the appropriations earmarked in 2005 for the production and dissemination of notices of public contracts in the Supplement to the Official Journal are set to rise by EUR 3 million to a total of EUR 32.5 million.      Council Resolution of 17 December 1998 on operating instructions for technical consumer goods [Official Journal C 411 of 31.12.1998].      The Council called on the Member States and economic operators to pursue the objective of providing information which can be understood by consumers from the linguistic point of view. For example, manuals for technical consumer goods should be written in a country's own official language or another language which is readily comprehensible in the region where the product is sold. This applies also to goods from third countries or regions. Both the Council and the Commission follow the case law of the Court of Justice, e.g. Case C-33/97/2 on labelling.     In November 1993, the Commission presented an       interpretative communication concerning the use of languages in the marketing of foodstuffs in the light of the judgment in the "         Peeters        " case [         COM(1993) 532        final].

   European contract law     European contract law     With this communication, the European Commission aims to broaden the debate on European contract law by involving the European Parliament, the Council and the other stakeholders, including businesses, legal practitioners, academics and consumer groups.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on European contract law [       COM(2001) 398      final - Official Journal C 255 of 13.9.2001].     SUMMARY     The approximation of certain specific areas of contract law at Community level has covered an increasing number of issues. The Community legislator has followed a selective approach, adopting directives on specific contracts or marketing techniques where a particular need for harmonisation was identified. The Commission is interested in gathering information on the need for wider-reaching Community action in the area of contract law, in particular to the extent that the case-by-case approach might not be able to solve all the problems which might arise.     The Commission is seeking information as to whether problems result from divergences in contract law between Member States and, if so, what these problems are. In particular, it asks whether the proper functioning of the internal market may be hindered by problems relating to the conclusion, interpretation and application of cross-border contracts. It is also interested in whether different national contract laws discourage cross-border transactions or increase the related costs.     The communication also seeks views on whether the existing approach of sectoral harmonisation of contract law could lead to possible inconsistencies at Community or national level as regards application of the transposition measures.     If concrete problems are identified, the Commission would also like to receive views from the private sector and civil society on what form solutions should or could take. In order to assist in defining possible solutions, the communication includes a non-exhaustive list of possible solutions. However, other solutions may be suggested by any interested party.     The proposed solutions are:      to leave the solution of any problems identified to the market;       to promote the development of non-binding, common contract law principles. These principles could be useful for contracting parties in drafting their contracts, for national courts and arbitrators in their decisions and for national legislators in drawing up legislative initiatives;       to review and improve existing Community legislation in the area of contract law so as to make it more coherent or to adapt it to cover situations not foreseen at the time of adoption;       to adopt a new instrument at Community level, combining rules on general aspects of contract law and on specific questions.      If the best solution envisaged is the adoption of a consistent and comprehensive instrument, the Commission recalls that several variables must be taken into consideration. In this connection, it will be appropriate to discuss:      the nature of the instrument to be adopted (regulation, directive or recommendation);       the link with the national legislation (which might be replaced or which might co-exist alongside Community legislation);       the possibility of distinguishing between mandatory and non-binding rules;       whether the contracting parties would choose to apply the Community instrument or whether certain rules apply automatically as a safety net of fallback provisions if the contracting parties have not agreed a specific solution.      The communication merely intends to stimulate a debate.

act   Council  Regulation (EU) No 559/2014  of 6 May 2014 establishing the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking.   summary   The  FCH 2 JU  seeks to  deploy the benefits  of fuel cells, an efficient conversion technology (i.e. it converts a fuel source into power) and of hydrogen, a clean energy carrier, to help address the energy challenges faced in Europe. Potentially, fuel cells and hydrogen can offer a number of advantages such as:        —     allowing renewable energy technology to be applied to transport;            —     facilitating distributed (i.e. small-scale) power generation; and            —     addressing the intermittent nature of renewables, such as wind power.      Harnessing their use should help fight carbon emissions, reduce dependence on mainly imported hydrocarbons and contribute to growth and jobs.  After a successful first generation that saw some early applications brought to market, FCH 2 JU is looking to accelerate the commercial deployment of hydrogen-based energy and transport solutions across Europe. FCH 2 JU is established for a period up to 31 December 2024.  This phase will involve  improving the performance  and  reducing the cost of products  , as well as  demonstrating  on a wider scale  the readiness of the technology  for transport (cars, buses and refuelling infrastructure) and energy (hydrogen production and distribution, energy storage and stationary power generation).   Management   The FCH 2 JU is a legal entity established in line with Article 187v of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (which allows for PPPs at EU level in the field of industrial research).The JU sets its own strategic research agenda and funds projects selected following calls for proposals published on the  FCH 2 JU’s website  . The JU applies the Horizon 2020 rules for participation.  The JU is managed by an  Executive Director who is supported by the staff of the Programme Office  . The JU has a  governing board  comprising industry and European Commission representatives. It has overall responsibility for the operations of the JU and oversees the implementation of its activities. It is advised by a  Scientific Committee  on scientific priorities. There is also a  states representatives group  representing the countries involved and a  stakeholder forum  . Decisions are taken in accordance with the voting rules established by the JU.  Article 209 of the  EU’s Financial Regulation  (Regulation (EU, Euratom) No  966/2012  ) provides for new lighter rules customised for EU PPP bodies.

summary of   Directive 2004/37/EC — protection from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens or mutagens at work    Corrigendum   what is the aim of the directive  It sets out the minimum requirements for protecting workers against risks to their health and safety arising, or likely to arise, from exposure to  carcinogens   *  and  mutagens   *  at work. To reduce the risks associated with such exposure to workers’ health and safety, it lays down preventive and protective measures, as well as exposure limits.   key points    Scope   The directive applies to a substance or mixture which meets the criteria for classification as a  category 1A or 1B carcinogen  or  category 1A or 1B germ cell mutagen  set out in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 (  Classification, packaging and labelling of chemicals and their mixtures  ). In addition, it applies to a carcinogenic substance, mixture or process referred to in Annex I to the directive, as well as a substance or mixture released by a process referred to in that annex. Following the  amendment of the directive  in 2017, this annex contains 6 entries:    1.    Manufacture of  auramine  .      2.    Work involving exposure to  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  present in coal soot, coal tar or coal pitch.      3.    Work involving exposure to dusts, fumes and sprays produced during the roasting and electro-refining of  cupro-nickel mattes  .      4.    Strong acid process in the manufacture of  isopropyl alcohol  .      5.    Work involving exposure to  hardwood dusts  .      6.    Work which generates  respirable crystalline silica dust  .     The directive does not apply to workers exposed only to  radiation  covered by the  Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community  .  It applies to workers exposed to  asbestos  when its rules are more favourable to health and safety at work than those of Directive 2009/148/EC (  Workers' protection from exposure to asbestos  ).  Directive 89/391/EEC (  Health and safety at work — general rules  ) applies in full, without prejudice to more binding and/or more specific rules contained in this directive.   Determining exposure and assessing risks   In the case of any activity likely to involve a risk of exposure to carcinogens or mutagens, the nature, degree and duration of workers’ exposure must be determined on a regular basis in order to assess any risk to workers’ health or safety and decide the steps to be taken. All routes of exposure must be taken into account, including absorption into and/or through the skin. Particular attention must be paid to workers who are especially at risk.   Directive 2014/27/EU  aligns Directive 2004/37/EC to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 which established a  new system for the classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures  in the EU, based on the  Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals  at international level.   Directive (EU) 2017/2398  updates Directive 2004/37/EC by:   amending Articles 6 (  Information for the competent authority  ) and 14 (  Health surveillance  );   introducing a new Article 18a (  Evaluation  );   revising Annex I and Annex III, in order to bring  respirable crystalline silica dust  within the scope of the directive and to introduce new, or update the existing,  occupational exposure limit values  (OELs) for 13 carcinogens.    EMPLOYERS’ OBLIGATIONS    Reduction and replacement   Employers must reduce the use of a carcinogen or mutagen, particularly by replacing it, in so far as is technically possible, by a substance, mixture or process that is not dangerous or is less dangerous.   Prevention and reduction of exposure   When it is not possible to replace the carcinogen or mutagen, the employer must ensure that the carcinogen or mutagen is manufactured and used in a closed system. If this is not technically possible, employers must ensure that the level of exposure is as low as is technically possible.  Exposure must not exceed the limits set out in Annex III.  Several measures must be applied by the employer whenever a carcinogen or mutagen is used.   Information for the competent authority   Employers must provide the competent authority, on request, with information relating to such matters as, for instance, the reasons for using carcinogens or mutagens, the preventive measures taken or the number of workers exposed.   Unforeseeable exposure   In the event of unforeseeable incidents or accidents likely to lead to workers being abnormally exposed, employers must inform their workers. Protective clothing and respiratory personal protective equipment must be worn, and exposure must be kept to the strict minimum necessary and only workers who are essential for the work shall be permitted to work in the concerned area.   Foreseeable exposure   Where there is a foreseeable risk of increased exposure, for example, during maintenance work, and after all other preventive measures have been taken, employers must decide the measures necessary to reduce the duration of workers’ exposure to the minimum possible and to ensure that they are protected during these activities. Protective clothing and individual respiratory personal protective equipment must be worn, and exposure must be kept to the strict minimum necessary. Moreover, the areas used for such activities must be clearly demarcated and indicated.   Access to risk areas   Employers must restrict access to risk areas to those workers who, by virtue of their work or duties, are required to enter such areas.   Measures regarding hygiene and personal protection   Employers are required to take the following measures regarding hygiene and personal protection for all activities that carry a risk of contamination:   ensure that workers do no eat, drink or smoke in work areas where there is a risk of contamination;   supply workers with the appropriate clothes and provide separate storage places for work clothes and street clothes;   provide washing and toilet facilities;   properly store, check and clean protective equipment before and after every use.   Workers must not bear the cost of these measures.   Informing, training and consulting workers   Employers must take appropriate steps to ensure that workers and/or their representatives receive sufficient and suitable training about:   potential and additional health risks (smoking);   precautions for preventing exposure;   hygiene requirements;   protective equipment and clothing;   measures to be taken in the event of an incident.   Employers must ensure that containers, packages and installations containing carcinogens or mutagens are clearly and legibly labelled, and that warning signs are clearly displayed.  Appropriate measures must be taken to ensure that workers are able to check whether the directive is being applied correctly. They must be informed as quickly as possible in the event of abnormal exposure.  Employers must have an updated list of workers undertaking activities that carry a risk to their health and safety in terms of exposure to carcinogens and mutagens.  Workers and/or their representatives must be consulted about and involved in all matters related to exposure to carcinogens and mutagens.   MISCELLANEOUS MEASURES    Health monitoring   EU countries must establish arrangements for monitoring workers’ health so that, if appropriate, their health is adequately monitored prior to exposure and at regular intervals afterwards. These arrangements must be such that it is possible to apply individual and work-related health measures. When a worker’s health is monitored, an individual medical file is to be created.  Following the amendment of Directive 2004/37/EC by Directive (EU) 2017/2398, health monitoring can, at the advice of a doctor or authority responsible for the health monitoring of workers, continue after the end of exposure for as long as considered to be necessary to safeguard the health of the worker concerned.  Practical recommendations relating to the monitoring of workers’ health can be found in Annex II.  All cases of cancer identified as resulting from exposure at work must be notified to the competent authority. EU countries must take this information into account in their reports submitted to the  European Commission  under Directive 89/391/EEC.   Evaluation   Directive (EU) 2017/2398 requires the Commission to evaluate, as part of the next evaluation of the implementation of Directive 2004/37/EC, the need to modify the limit value for respirable crystalline silica dust.  In addition, by the first quarter of 2019, the Commission must, taking into account the latest developments in scientific knowledge, assess the option of amending the scope of this directive to include  reprotoxic  substances  *  .   Record-keeping   The up-to-date list of workers who have been exposed, which the employer is required to keep, and individual medical files are to be kept for at least 40 years after the end of exposure.   Limit values   Following the amendment of the Directive in 2017, Annex III contains the limit values for the following substances:   Hardwood dust   Chromium (VI) compounds which are carcinogens within the meaning of point (i) of Article 2(a) (as chromium)   Refractory ceramic fibres which are carcinogens within the meaning of point (i) of Article 2(a)   Respirable crystalline silica dust   Benzene   Vinyl chloride monomer   Ethylene oxide   1,2-Epoxypropane   Acrylamide   2-Nitropropane   o-Toluidine   1,3-Butadiene   Hydrazine   Bromoethylene.   For vinyl chloride monomer and hardwood dusts, Directive (EU) 2017/2398 revises the limit values in the light of more recent scientific data. For 11 new carcinogens, occupational exposure limit values were introduced.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 20 May 2004. Directive 2004/37/EC  codifies  and replaces  Directive 90/394/EEC  and its successive amendments,  Directives 97/42/EC  and  1999/38/EC  . The deadlines for those directives to become national law (29 April 2003 at the latest) continued to apply.  EU countries have to incorporate the measures introduced by Directive (EU) 2017/2398 into national law by 17 January 2020.   background   For more information, see:    Directive 2004/37/EC — carcinogens or mutagens at work  (  European Agency for Safety and Health at Work  ).   key terms    Carcinogens:  substances with the potential to cause cancer in an organism.   Mutagens:  substances that change the genetic material of an organism.   Reprotoxic substances:  substances that interfere with reproduction.
   Report on equality between men and women, 2004     Report on equality between men and women, 2004     The European Commission is presenting its first annual report for the Spring European Council on the progress made in mainstreaming the gender dimension in various strategic areas. The slow rate of progress threatens to jeopardise the achievement of the Lisbon objectives.     ACT     Report from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 19 February 2004, "Report on equality between women and men, 2004" [       COM(2004) 115      - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     In response to the request of the 2003 Spring European Council, the Commission has drafted, in collaboration with the Member States, an annual report to the Spring European Council on the progress achieved in promoting equality between women and men and on the approaches taken with a view to mainstreaming the gender dimension into the various policies.      EQUALITY BETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN: STATE OF PLAY      The Member States and accession countries have undoubtedly made progress towards greater equality between women and men. The Commission report confirms a positive trend towards reducing inequalities between the sexes in several strategic fields.     For example, in most of Europe there are more females than males in secondary and higher education. Today, the majority of graduates are women, even if they are still in a minority at the highest level of education. Moreover, use of the Structural Funds, in particular the European Social Fund, has been found to have a catalyser effect on national gender equality policies.     However, the rate of progress observed tends to vary over time and from one Member State to another. Inequalities persist in most of the strategic areas, and slow progress is jeopardising Europe's competitiveness. According to the objective set at Lisbon, the European Union has committed itself to becoming, by 2010, the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world. The active participation of women on the labour market and reducing the gap between the sexes in the various fields are vital if this objective is to be achieved.     The Commission therefore calls on the Member States, via the European Council, to redouble their efforts to promote equality between men and women in all areas of society and draws their attention to certain challenges.      THE CHALLENGES       Effectiveness of the Community's gender equality policy      The Commission emphasises the need to guarantee the rapid implementation in the Member States of recently adopted legislation and the correct transposition of EU law in the area of equal treatment in the accession countries.     For reasons of simplicity and legal certainty, and in the context of enlargement, the Commission plans to replace the existing legal texts with a single directive on the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment for men and women in work and employment. The Commission also wishes to see the adoption, before March 2005, of the proposal for a directive extending the scope of equal treatment legislation beyond the labour market, to include, in particular, access to goods and services and the provision of goods and services.      Reducing inequalities on the labour market in employment and pay      The Commission notes that, although it has definitely narrowed, the gap between women and men in employment and unemployment rates remains considerable. However, they should be less pronounced after the enlargement of the Union. The pay gap between women and men is still wide, more so in the private sector than in the public sector. Women are still particularly vulnerable to poverty, especially when they are less well educated, suffering domestic violence, older or living alone with children.     It is vital for Member States to pursue their efforts to ensure equal treatment for men and women on the labour market and to meet the Lisbon objective of a female employment rate of 60% by 2010. The Commission would like to draw their attention to certain priorities: promoting the quality of employment, making work pay, combating pay cuts in occupations where the number of women is starting to rise and obtaining a real commitment from the social partners.      Work/home life balance      The opportunities for women and men to balance their career with their home life has a decisive impact on the success of strategies for increasing employment rates. The report shows that women perform the majority of domestic and family tasks. The Commission recommends the promotion of parental leave systems shared by both parents, particularly in order to ward off the negative impact of long-term maternity leave on women's employment. In order to allow women and men to continue to work, Member States should improve the supply of childcare services and care for other dependants, using sufficient, appropriate structures. It is also important to encourage men to shoulder a more equal burden of family responsibilities.      Promoting the balanced participation of men and women in decision-making      Women are still under-represented in political and economic decision-making processes, at European and national levels. Governments, political parties and all the social partners should therefore be mobilised in order to ensure balanced representation of men and women in decision-making in all areas of society. The Commission is also promoting a balanced representation of men and women in the elections to the European Parliament in 2004.      Implementation of gender mainstreaming      The Commission emphasises the need to step up the implementation of gender mainstreaming in all the relevant strategic areas, both in the Member States and at EU level. Moreover, equality between men and women must remain a priority in the use of all the Structural Funds, especially in the context of the new programming period for the Structural Funds. It is also important to strive for equality between men and women in the       European Research Area      .      Combating violence against women and the trafficking of women      The Commission is in favour of moving beyond the mere political recognition of the need to eliminate violence against women and the trafficking of women. The Member States and the accession countries must step up and broaden their efforts, formulate benchmarks and measure progress against them. Preventing and combating violence in the home is essentially a local and national matter, but may also come within the framework of the new programme       Daphné II      . The trafficking of women must be combated using a global approach which includes prosecution, victim protection and assistance, as well as preventive measures based on campaigns and cross-border and international cooperation.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 543/2009 — crop statistics   what is the aim of this regulation  It lays down common rules for EU-wide statistics on agricultural land use and crop production.   key points   EU countries must provide the European Commission (  Eurostat  ) with quality annual agricultural statistics on land use and total production of:   crops from arable land;   vegetables, melons and strawberries, and   permanent crops  *  ;   EU countries must:   provide the data annually, within specified time limits, for the relevant harvest year  *  ;   ensure the accuracy of all data;   provide the Commission every 3 years, starting on 1 October 2011, with reports on the quality of the data they send.   The  European Commission  may:   amend non-essential elements of the legislation. It did so through Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No  2015/1557  when it updated the annex containing the full list of crops covered by the regulation.   The data cover  over 100 crops  in different categories and subcategories:   cereals (17 categories),   other main crops, mainly   dry pulses (such as beans, lentils and peas),   protein,   root (such as potatoes or sugar beet),   industrial crops (such as cotton, oilseed crops, hops and tobacco) (29),     vegetables (40),   permanent crops (41),   utilised agricultural land (18).   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 1 January 2010.   background   Accurate and timely crop statistics are essential to ensure proper administration of the common agricultural policy and management of the various individual product markets.  Data for cereals have been available since 1955 and since the early 1960s for fruit and vegetables. Most EU governments began sending data in the 1970s and 1980s, once they had joined the EU.  Eurostat, the EU’s statistical office, publishes data from the EU countries, the  European Free Trade Association  (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland) and current and potential EU  candidate countries  .  For more information, see:    Main annual crop statistics  (  Eurostat  ).   key terms    Permanent crops:  crops that are harvested from perennial bushes, trees and vines such as raspberries, apples and grapes.   Harvest year:  the calendar year in which the harvest begins.
   Code of conduct for use of computerized reservation systems     Code of conduct for use of computerized reservation systems     The aim of this Regulation is to ensure fair competition between air carriers and between computerized reservation systems, in order to protect the interests of consumers.     ACT     Council Regulation (EEC) No       2299/89      of 24 July 1989 on a code of conduct for computerized reservation systems [Official Journal L 220 of 29.07.1989]. [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     The regulations apply to computerized reservation systems (CRS) for air transport products, when offered for use and/or used in the territory of the Community.     Capacity of the system vendor to act in its own name and as a separate entity from the parent carrier.     Obligation on the system vendor to allow any air carrier the opportunity to participate, on an equal and non-discriminatory basis, in its distribution facilities.     Obligation on carriers participating in a computerized reservation system to communicate, with equal care and timeliness, information on schedules, fares and availability relating to their own air services to any other system requesting it.     Obligation on the system vendor to refrain from discrimination in loading and/or processing data provided by participating carriers and to separate its distribution facilities in a clear and verifiable manner from the private inventory of any carrier.     Obligation to provide clear and non-discriminatory displays. The displays must contain accurate, non-misleading information.     Provisions on the supply by a system vendor of information from its CRS relating to confidentiality and data protection as regards access of parent carriers to the information supplied by carriers or generated for their use.     Obligations on parent carriers.     Provisions on access by subscribers to the CRS distribution facilities.     Provisions on the fees charged by the system vendor.     Monitoring of the technical compliance of the CRS with the confidentiality and data protection requirements by an independent auditor, at least once a year.     Remedy available in the event of violation.     Regulation (EC) No       323/1999      took up the suggestions made by the Commission in its 1997 report on the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No       2299/89      .

The report aims to summarise the experience gained in the last twelve months in applying the provisions on the obligations placed on a system vendor to prevent its parent carriers benefiting from preferential treatment in the operation of the CRS which, either separately or jointly, they own or effectively control. However, a lack of information prevented the Commission from examining the impact of these Articles on the operation of CRS, and thus from producing a comprehensive report on which the Council could in turn base its own examination. It was therefore proposed that the Commission submit by 31 December 1995 a second report on the basis of which the Council would examine the application of Articles 4a and 6(3). The dissemination of this second report was postponed.      Report      -       not published in the Official Journal      Commission report on the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No       2299/89      on a code of conduct for computerised reservation systems (CRSs) [       COM(97) 246      final].     The report reviews the application of the code of conduct for using CRSs. In a second section, the Commission suggests a number of changes to the code, relating to:      subscriber obligations, absent from the existing code;       extension of the code's scope to include rail transport;       charging policy;       display of code-share flights;       scope of the audit of CRS technical compliance;       ticketing arrangements for flights carrying the same flight number operated by the same carrier;       security package;       right of a defendant to be heard;       inclusion of information systems within the scope of the code;       ranking of flights;       billing information on magnetic media.      The report is followed by a proposal for a regulation amending Council Regulation (EEC) No °       2299/89      . This proposal was adopted and became Regulation (EC) No       323/1999      .

   European system for registration of carriers of radioactive materials (Proposal)     European system for registration of carriers of radioactive materials (Proposal)     This Proposal for a Regulation aims at replacing national reporting and authorisation procedures relating to carriers of radioactive materials by a unique registration system. The implementation of the Regulation should enable procedures to be simplified and administrative burden to be reduced, whilst maintaining a high level of radiation protection.     PROPOSAL     Proposal for a Council Regulation of 30 August 2011 establishing a Community system for registration of carriers of radioactive materials [       COM(2011) 518      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This Proposal for a Regulation aims at putting in place a European system for registration of carriers of radioactive materials       *      . Workers and the general public must be protected against the       dangers arising from ionising radiation      .     The Proposal concerns any carrier transporting radioactive materials within the European Union (EU), from third countries into the EU and from the EU into third countries. It does not concern carriers transporting radioactive materials by air or sea.      Registration of carriers      Carriers must register with the       Electronic System for Carrier Registration      (ESCReg). The system offers restricted and secure access to the competent authorities of the Member States, to the registered carriers and to the applicants, in accordance with the provisions of the       Data Protection Directive      .     If an applicant is established in one or more Member States, its application is processed by the competent authority       *      of the Member State where its head office is located. If the applicant is established in a third country, its application is processed by the competent authority of the Member State where the carrier intends to first enter EU territory.     Member States shall designate a competent authority and a national contact point for the transport of radioactive materials.     If the competent authority refuses to grant the carrier a certificate of registration, the applicant may lodge an appeal.     The certificate of registration is recognised by all Member States and is valid for a period of five years. It may be renewed.      Conditions of transport for radioactive materials      Once registered, the carrier is authorised to carry out transport operations throughout the EU. Carriers must have a copy of their registration certificate during such transport operations.     National reporting and authorisation requirements in addition to those of this Proposal for a Regulation may only apply for the following materials:      fissile materials;       high consequence radioactive materials.      However, holders of a licence or registration issued pursuant to the       Directive on the dangers arising from ionising radiation      may transport radioactive materials without registration if their transport is included in licences or registrations for all Member States where the transport takes place.     If carriers do not comply with the requirements of this Proposal for a Regulation, the authorities of the Member State where the offence is recorded may suspend, revoke or modify the carrier’s registration. The carrier may also be prosecuted.      Context      In 2008, the Council and the Parliament adopted the       Directive on the transport of dangerous goods      grouping together all modes of inland transport. Pursuant to Directive 96/29/Euratom, which lays down basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against       dangers arising from ionising radiation      , Member States must put in place a system for the registration of companies and institutions processing radioactive materials, including carriers. Under this Proposal for a Regulation, registration will be centralised in order to facilitate transport within the EU.       Key terms of the Act         Radioactive material: any material containing radionuclides where both the activity concentration and the total activity in the consignment exceed the values specified in the           Regulation on shipments of radioactive substances          Competent authority: any authority designated by the Member State to carry out tasks in accordance with this Regulation.

   Sustainable Consumption, Production and Industry Action Plan     Sustainable Consumption, Production and Industry Action Plan     The Commission proposes a number of measures to support the implementation, in the European Union and internationally, of a policy to promote environmentally friendly consumption and production.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 25 June 2008 on the ‘Sustainable Consumption and Production and Sustainable Industrial Policy Action Plan’ [       COM(2008) 397 final      – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The Commission proposes the implementation of a series of measures to improve the energy and environmental performance of products throughout their life cycle, and to stimulate demand and consumption of better quality products, thus creating a ‘virtuous circle’.     These targets may be reached by:      extending the scope of the Directive on         ecodesign        , which for the moment only applies to energy-using products, to all energy-related products or those products which have an impact on energy consumption during their use (window frames, water-using devices etc.);       extending the scope of the         Energy Labelling        Directive to cover a wider range of products;       revising the         Ecolabel        Regulation to simplify and streamline the process of obtaining an ecolabel, and to extend the product coverage;       promoting         green public procurement        , by providing guidance and tools for public authorities to "green" their procurement practices;       implementing incentive measures aimed at reducing the environmental footprint of the retail sector and its supply chain, promote more sustainable products, and better inform consumers.       Leaner production      There is already a regulatory framework for production processes concerning       environmental emissions from industries      and the       greenhouse gas emission allowance trading scheme      , in particular. The Commission considers however that there is a need to give further impetus to environmentally friendly production processes and energy savings. In this context, the Commission intends to act in three areas:      increase efficient use of resources (creating more value while using less resources);       support eco-innovation;       enhance the environmental potential of industry, by revising the         EMAS        Regulation (Community eco-management and audit scheme), by preparing industrial policies for environmental industries and by helping small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to fully exploit business opportunities in the field of environment and energy.       Acting on a global scale      Action will also be undertaken at a global level:      promote good practice internationally in sustainable production and consumption;       promote international trade in environmentally friendly goods and services;       promote sector-based agreements in international negotiations on climate change.       Context      The action plan forms part of the European Union Strategy for       Sustainable Development      and the       Community Lisbon Programme for 2008-2010      of which one of the main orientations is the promotion of an industrial policy geared towards more sustainable consumption and production. The Commission will review progress and report on the implementation of the initiatives proposed in 2012.     Last updated: 22.09.2008  
   Towards a Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS)     Towards a Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS)     The Commission defines the necessary principles to introduce a Community Shared Environmental Information System. It undertakes a cost-benefit analysis of its introduction and takes stock of the measures already implemented and those still to be taken.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 23 January 2008 entitled "Towards a Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS)" [       COM(2008) 46      final – Official Journal C 118 of 15.5.2008]     SUMMARY     The environmental challenges of today – most notably climate change, biodiversity loss and managing natural resources – mean that environmental information must be quickly and easily available. Furthermore, thanks to the new technologies, it is possible to receive near real-time information, which enables decisions to be taken more rapidly and even lives to be saved.     In this Communication, the Commission lays the foundations for a European Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS) to respond to the above-mentioned requirements and challenges. Such a system would gradually replace the current systems for reporting by systems based on access, sharing and interoperability. This would allow improvement and simplification of the collection, exchange and use of the data and information necessary for the preparation and implementation of environmental policy and actions.      The principle of SEIS      According to the Commission, under SEIS, the information should be managed on a decentralised basis, collected once then shared with all interested parties and be readily accessible to end-users, at whatever level (public authorities and citizens). The system should also take account of any confidentiality constraints regarding certain data, and sharing and processing should be supported through common, free/open-source software tools.     Ozone Web, a site launched in 2006, is a concrete example of the services which an open shared environmental information system can provide. This site involved the Member States providing the European Environment Agency (EEA) with near real-time ozone values in Europe. In particular, it provided experts and citizens with information on air quality as regards this pollutant and with access to information which is local or specific to certain regions.      Benefits and costs      The benefits of SEIS include:      simplification, efficiency and flexibility of the procedures (data and information flows) to ensure the availability of the information to fulfil the Member States’ reporting and monitoring obligations, efficiency of the use of the data and information (rapid availability and once-only collection for multiple purposes) and reduction in the workload of the authorities responsible for data collection;       reduction in costs for users and greater use of these data to draw up public policy and to improve its effectiveness, especially where it is a matter of reacting to environmental problems, such as adaptation to climate change, protection of biodiversity, management of water resources, and management of environmental crises;       empowering citizens and encouraging rapid reaction, especially in cases of emergency.      When assessing the costs of implementing the SEIS principles, it is important to recognise that many relevant activities are already ongoing, and the main challenge – and the reason why a more formal political commitment around SEIS principles is required – is to align these activities more effectively. Some further investment will certainly be necessary in order to achieve full implementation of the SEIS principles. These costs will relate in particular to the implementation of the INSPIRE Directive, making the national or Community data collection and processing systems interoperable and integrating these national systems in a "system of systems", collecting new data that are not currently collected but are found to be essential to support policy, and harmonisation of the monitoring and data management systems. Such investments will be offset by better prioritisation of data requirements and use of data and information, administrative effectiveness, simplification and repeal of obsolete obligations.      Initiatives and measures in progress      At present, efforts have already been made for the implementation of SEIS, including, for instance, several measures to streamline the reporting requirements concerning air quality under the       thematic strategy on air pollution      , the review of the       IPPC Directive      and relations between air pollution and climate change. Other initiatives adopt a modern approach to the production, exchange and use of data and information, for example the       Water Information System for Europe (WISE)      .     Various tools may also be mutually supporting, including the       INSPIRE      infrastructure concerning accessibility and interoperability of spatial data, the       Aarhus agreement      on public access to environmental information, the       GMES initiative      on global monitoring for the environment, the activities of the GEO group in respect of a Global Earth Observation System of Systems, the Marine Observation and Data Network, research activities (especially       eTEN      , eContent and CIP), the European framework for interoperable online public services (IDABC) and the EIONET network of the       European Environment Agency      .     In addition, various initiatives at national, regional and local level are also helping to make SEIS a reality in specific fields.      Action to be taken      The introduction of SEIS firstly requires political commitment on the part of the Member States, with a view to mobilising efforts in a coordinated fashion towards the same integrated project. This would take the concrete form of strengthening and coordination of the activities under way at European, national and regional levels. The Commission, for its part, would give priority to the INSPIRE Directive and the GMES initiative, so that these activities become mutually supporting.     The legal provisions relating to the collection of environmental information and the way it is made available will have to modernised, in particular by revising Directive       91/692/EEC      on standardising reports relating to the environment, in order to repeal outdated provisions and cover all the current environmental reporting obligations. Along the same lines, there is a need to streamline the information requirements for specific fields.     SEIS would have to be at the centre of the EEA activities concerning the provision of environmental information, including the adoption in full of the Reportnet tool and its adaptation to SEIS.     The introduction of SEIS would have to benefit from Community financial support, in particular through the       Research Framework Programmes      , the       LIFE+      programme, the       Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme      and the Structural Funds.     The existing national monitoring systems will have to be harmonised and their planning and implementation coordinated.     In addition, the SEIS approach would then have to be extended to third countries and especially the applicant countries and the neighbouring countries.     Last updated: 05.09.2011  
   A financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights in the world (2007 – 2013)     A financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights in the world (2007 – 2013)     This Regulation establishes a European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights providing assistance contributing to the development and enhancement of democracy and the rule of law, and of respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms.     ACT     Regulation (EC) No       1889/2006      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on establishing a financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide.     SUMMARY     This Regulation puts in place a financing instrument aiming to encourage democracy and human rights in non-EU countries, and replaces the previous       European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights      .      Characteristics      The Instrument is aimed in particular at:      enhancing respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in the countries and regions where they are most threatened;       supporting civil society in its role of promoting human rights and democracy, its action for the peaceful conciliation of particular interests and its duty of representation and political participation;       supporting actions associated with human rights and democracy in areas covered by the Community guidelines;       strengthening the international and regional framework in the field of the protection of human rights, justice, the rule of law and the promotion of democracy;       building confidence in democratic electoral processes by enhancing their reliability and transparency, in particular through election observation.      To pursue these aims, Community aid is in support of the following actions:      promotion of participatory and representative democracy, processes of democratisation, mainly through civil society organisations, in particular: promoting the freedoms of association and assembly, opinion and expression; strengthening the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary; promoting political pluralism and democratic political representation; promoting the equal participation of men and women in social, economic and political life; supporting measures to facilitate the peaceful conciliation of group interests;       protection of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international and regional instruments, mainly through civil society organisations.      To ensure the effectiveness and consistency of assistance, the Commission ensures close coordination between its own activities and those of the Member States. Assistance under this Regulation is also consistent with the Community's policy on development cooperation and with the European Union's foreign and security policy as a whole. It is also meant to complement assistance under the Community instruments for external assistance and the Partnership Agreement with the African, Caribbean and Pacific states (ACP).      Management and application      Assistance is implemented through:      strategy papers, defining the Community’s priorities, the international situation and the activities of the main partners;       annual action programmes based on strategy papers and their possible amendments;       and special measures which are not provided for in the strategy papers and which may be adopted by the Commission;        ad hoc        measures so that the Commission can make small grants to human rights defenders responding to urgent protection needs.       The following are eligible for funding under the Regulation      :      civil society organisations,       public- and private-sector non-profit organisations,       national, regional and international parliamentary bodies, where the proposed measure cannot be financed under a related Community external assistance instrument,       international and regional inter-governmental organisations       natural persons, where their help is necessary for achieving the aims of the Regulation establishing the European Instrument for democracy and human rights.      Exceptionally, other bodies or actors may be financed where necessary to achieve the objectives of this Regulation.     Assistance granted under this Regulation may take the following forms:      projects and programmes,       grants to finance projects submitted by international and regional inter-governmental organisations,       small grants to human rights defenders,       grants to support operating costs of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the European Inter-University Centre for Human Rights and Democratisation (EIUC),       contributions to international funds,       human and material resources for EU election observation missions       public contracts.      Participation in calls for tender or granting subsidy contracts is open to, among others, all physical or moral persons from a Member State of the European Union or resident in one of these, in an acceding country, one which is an official candidate, a member of the European Economic Area, a developing country (as specified by the       Development Assistance Committee      of the OECD), and international organisations.     The Commission is assisted by a human rights and democracy committee.     The Commission presents in an annual report the progress made in applying the assistance for businesses measures under this Regulation.     The instrument has been granted a budget of EUR 1.104 million for the period 2007-2013.      References            Act                 Entry into force - Date of expiry                 Deadline for transposition in the Member States                 Official Journal                Regulation (EC) No                 1889/2006                30.12.2006 – 31.12.2013               -               OJ L 386 of 29.12.2006          RELATED ACTS      Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2009 amending Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation and amending Regulation (EC) No 1889/2006 on establishing a financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide [         COM(2009) 194        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      It is necessary to improve the proper implementation of programmes and projects funded by the instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights. The Parliament and the Council therefore propose to relax the criteria for eligibility to funding, concerning the costs relating to taxes and duties payable in the beneficiary countries. Tax exemption or tax recovery mechanisms do not exist in all of the States concerned, which constitutes a barrier for participants in the programme.

act   Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Addressing the consequences of disenfranchisement of Union citizens exercising their right to free movement (  COM(2014) 33 final  of 29 January 2014).   summary   EU citizens from certain Member States lose the right to vote (they are  ‘disenfranchised’  ) in national elections of their home country once they reside abroad for a given period a time, including in another EU country. As a consequence, they are not able to participate in any national elections, whether in their own country or in their country of residence.   Five Member States  are concerned (Denmark, Ireland, Cyprus, Malta and the United Kingdom (   1   )), citizens of which can lose their right to vote solely on the grounds that they have been residing abroad for a certain period of time. Two other countries (Germany and Austria) impose certain conditions for maintaining the right to vote in national elections.  Disenfranchising citizens may be considered as  limiting the enjoyment of fundamental rights attached to Union citizenship  , such as the right to move and reside freely within the European Union. Moreover, it leads to a gap in the political rights of the EU citizens concerned that is inconsistent with the efforts to promote citizens’ participation in the democratic life of the Union.  On the one hand, the Commission proposes  short-term solutions  to this situation. EU countries should at least enable their nationals who reside in another EU country to retain their right to vote if they demonstrate a continuing interest in the political life of their national country. This could be, for example, by means of an  application to remain registered on the electoral roll  . Such applications could be renewed at appropriate intervals and their lodging should be possible by electronic means.  On the other hand, it recommends a  longer-term reflection  on how to remedy the gap in participation for EU citizens living in another Member State, taking also into account the current debate on  enfranchisement in the host country  .    (   1   ) The United Kingdom withdraws from the European Union and becomes a third country (non-EU country) as of 1 February 2020.
   EU strategy for biofuels     EU strategy for biofuels     The European Union (EU) sets out seven strategic policy areas for the development of the production and use of biofuels by the Member States and developing countries.     ACT     Commission Communication of 8 February 2006 entitled "An EU Strategy for Biofuels" [       COM(2006) 34      final - Official Journal C 67 of 18 March 2006].     SUMMARY     In its Strategy, the Commission defines the role that biofuels       *      produced from biomass, a renewable resource, may play in the future as a source of renewable energy serving as an alternative to the fossil fuel energy sources (chiefly oil) used in the transport sector. It also proposes measures to promote the production and use of biofuels.     The Strategy complements the Biomass Action Plan       *      adopted at the end of 2005 and responds to a threefold objective: further promotion of biofuels in the EU and in developing countries, preparation for the large-scale use of biofuels, and heightened cooperation with developing countries in the sustainable production of biofuels. This threefold objective breaks down into seven policy areas, which encompass the priorities envisaged by the Commission.     Among the measures intended to       stimulate demand for biofuels      , the Commission intends to bring forward a report on the implementation of the Biofuels Directive and the possible revision of the Directive, stressing the importance of national targets, biofuel use obligations and ensuring sustainable production of biofuels. The Commission will also pay particular attention to the tax benefits included in the 2003 Energy Taxation Directive and the possible establishment of a regulatory framework for incentives linked to the environmental performance of individual fuels. It will continue to encourage the use of biofuels in public and private vehicle fleets. To this end, at the end of 2005 it proposed a Directive on the promotion of clean vehicles for use in road transport.     Among measures intended for       ensuring environmental benefits      , the Commission intends to highlight the advantages of biofuels in terms of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases (and in particular to link these advantages to the promotion of biofuels). In addition, it is essential to guarantee that feedstock for biofuels is produced in a sustainable manner, both in the EU and in third countries, particularly with regard to the protection of biodiversity, water pollution, soil degradation and the protection of habitats and species. Another important element that should be taken into consideration is the compatibility of technical and environmental regulations, particularly with regard to maximum quantities of biofuels in petrol and diesel.     With a view to       developing the production and distribution of biofuels      , the Member States and regions are invited to consider the opportunities offered by biofuels in terms of economic activity and job creation within the context of the cohesion policy and rural development policy. The Commission has already proposed guidelines in this respect and intends to set up an ad hoc reflection group. The Commission will ask the relevant industries to justify their use of practices that act as barriers to the introduction of biofuels and will monitor the behaviour of these industries to ensure that there is no discrimination against biofuels.     In order to ensure sustainable production of biofuels, the Commission intends to       expand feedstock supplies      . One of the measures it intends to implement is to include sugar production for the manufacture of bioethanol       *      in CAP aid schemes. In addition, it will study the possibility of processing cereals from existing intervention stocks into biofuels, finance a campaign to inform farmers and forest operators, bring forward a Forestry Action Plan and examine the possibility of using animal by-products and waste as energy sources.     In order to       enhance the trade opportunities of biofuels      , the Commission will study the possibility of establishing separate customs codes for biofuels. It also intends to pursue a balanced approach to trade negotiations with ethanol-producing countries in order to ensure sustainable development of European production and imports of biofuels, and to submit an amendment to the standard for biodiesel       *      .     The Commission also wants to       support developing countries      with potential in terms of biofuels, particularly by means of accompanying measures for countries affected by EU       sugar reform      , a specific aid programme for biofuels, and a framework for effective cooperation that would include among other things the development of national biofuel platforms and regional biofuel action plans.     Lastly, it is essential that the Commission continue to       support research and innovation      , particularly in order to improve production processes and to lower costs. The principal measures will focus on,       inter alia      , continuing with activities in the field of research and development via the       Seventh Framework Programme      for Research and Development, the full use of second generation biomass and biofuels (i.e. originating from the processing of ligno-cellulosic feedstock such as straw and forest residues). The development of industry-led European technology platforms such as the European Biofuels Technology Platform, should make it possible to establish a shared European vision and strategy for the production and use of biofuels.      Background      The two main reasons for research into renewable energy sources as an alternative to oil are:      the significant contribution of transport to emissions of greenhouse gases. Emissions resulting from transport account for 21% of the total emissions of greenhouse gases. As a result, it is necessary to use fuels that are less polluting than oil;       the need to guarantee the security of energy supplies by diversifying fuel sources. The limited quantity of available oil and the increase in prices of fossil fuels represent increasingly urgent challenges for the transport sector and for national economies.        Key terms used in the act         Biofuel: liquid or gaseous fuel used for transport produced from biomass.         Biomass: the totality of organic animal or vegetable matter. This includes in particular the biodegradable fraction of products, wastes and residues from agriculture, forestry, industry and households.         Biodiesel: a methyl-ester produced from vegetable or animal oil, of diesel quality, to be used as biofuel.         Bioethanol: ethanol production from the fermentation of plants rich in sugar/starch, to be used as biofuel.

In 2005, biofuels were used in 17 of the 21 Member States for which data were available. The Commission indicates a significant increase in market share, reaching 1% on average (it has doubled in two years). Nonetheless, this figure is below the reference value fixed at 2%. In addition, the advances have been very varied: only Germany (3.8%) and Sweden (2.2%) achieved the reference value. While biodiesel achieved a share of about 1.6% of the diesel market, ethanol achieved a share of only 0.4% of the petrol market. On the basis of different projections, the Commission considers it unlikely that Member States will achieve the 5.75% target set by the Biofuels Directive for 2010. It considers that this Directive needs to be amended, in particular by setting a mandatory target of 10% for 2010 for the EU as a whole and by promoting high-quality biofuels. The report also contains an account of the economic and environmental impact linked to the promotion of biofuels.

   Using sewage sludge in farming     Using sewage sludge in farming     SUMMARY OF:      Directive 86/278/EEC on the protection of the environment, and in particular of the soil, when sewage sludge is used in agriculture      WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?      It sets rules on how farmers can use sewage sludge         *        as a fertiliser to prevent it harming the environment and human health, by ensuring that the nutrient needs of the plants are considered and that the quality of the         soil and of the surface and ground water        is not impaired.       To this end, it sets         limit values        on the concentrations allowed in soil of         7 heavy metals that may be toxic        to plants and humans:          cadmium           copper           nickel           lead           zinc           mercury           chromium.         It         bans        the use of sewage sludge that results in concentrations of these heavy metals in soil         exceeding these limit values        .       In 2018, the directive was amended by Decision (EU)         2018/853        as regards procedural rules in the field of environmental reporting.       In 2019, the directive was amended by Regulation (EU)         2019/1010        which aligns and streamlines the reporting requirements in environmental legislation.      KEY POINTS      The         specific limit values        are listed in the directive’s annexes:          Annex IA — heavy metals in the soil,           Annex IB — heavy metals in sludge,           Annex IC — maximum annual quantities of heavy metals that may be added to the soil.         Normally,         sludge has to be treated         *        before being used in farming. However, in some EU countries farmers may be allowed to use untreated sludge if it is injected or worked into the soil.       In certain situations,         sludge may not be used at all        in farming:          on grassland that is going to be grazed by animals or on forage crops to be harvested, unless a minimum of 3 weeks has elapsed,           on fruit and vegetable crops during the growing season. This rule does not include fruit trees,           on soil used to grow fruit and vegetable crops that are usually in direct contact with the soil and eaten raw. This ban applies for 10 months before the harvest and during the harvest itself.         Responsibility for ensuring farmers’ use of sludge does not exceed the legal limits lies with         national authorities        , who have to         sample and analyse sludge and the soil        it is used on and keep up-to-date records of:          how much sludge is produced and used in farming,           the composition and properties of sludge,           how the sludge has been treated,           where sludge is used and who uses it.         Following the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2019/1010, from 1 January 2022, EU countries must additionally keep a record of any other information regarding the directive’s transposition and implementation that they provide to the         European Commission        . They must also present the information registered in those records in such a way that the digital data refer to a specific location or geographical area       EU countries are required to send information to the Commission         every 3 years        on the implementation of this Directive, in the form of a         sectoral report        which shall also cover other pertinent directives, on the basis of the questionnaire outlined in Commission Decision 94/741/EC. Decision (EU) 2018/853 requires that these sectoral reports are drawn up on the basis of a questionnaire or outline adopted by the Commission in the form of an         implementing act        . The report must be sent to the Commission within 9 months of the end of the 3-year period covered by it.       Regulation (EU) 2019/1010, whose changes to this directive will apply from 1 January 2022, simplifies the reporting process. It also seeks to ensure that EU countries are more transparent with regard to the information they provide and that the public can access the information as rapidly as possible. The records referred to above must be made         available and easily accessible to the public        for each calendar year,         within 8 months of the end of the relevant calendar year        , and must also be submitted to the Commission.       The Commission publishes a regular report on sludge use in EU farming, which brings together the information reported by individual countries on this subject.      FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?     It has applied since 18 June 1986 and it had to become law in the EU countries by 18 June 1989.     BACKGROUND     For more information, see:       Sewage sludge        (         European Commission        ).      KEY TERMS      Sewage sludge:      sludge from domestic or urban waste treatment plants, septic tanks and similar sewage treatment plants.      Treated sludge:      sludge that has undergone biological, chemical or heat treatment, long-term storage or any other appropriate process to make it significantly less likely to ferment (reducing its risk to health).     MAIN DOCUMENT     Council Directive       86/278/EEC      of 12 June 1986 on the protection of the environment, and in particular of the soil, when sewage sludge is used in agriculture (OJ L 181, 4.7.1986, pp. 6-12)     Successive amendments to Directive 86/278/EEC have been incorporated into the original text. This       consolidated version      is of documentary value only.     RELATED DOCUMENTS     Regulation (EU)       2019/1010      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on the alignment of reporting obligations in the field of legislation related to the environment, and amending Regulations (EC) No 166/2006 and (EU) No 995/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directives 2002/49/EC, 2004/35/EC, 2007/2/EC, 2009/147/EC and 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Regulations (EC) No 338/97 and (EC) No 2173/2005, and Council Directive 86/278/EEC (OJ L 170, 25.6.2019, pp. 115-127)     last update 19.06.2020  
summary of   Directive 2008/7/EC — indirect taxes on the raising of capital   what is the aim of the directive   It seeks to regulate the indirect taxes levied by EU countries on the raising of capital. Indirect taxes are those levied on goods and services rather than on income or profits.   While it generally prohibits these taxes, notably capital duty  *  , it allows certain countries to levy them if they meet certain exceptional conditions.   key points    Tax and the companies concerned   The directive seeks to regulate the levying of indirect taxes on:   contributions of capital to capital companies;   restructuring operations involving capital companies;   the issue of certain securities and debentures (long-term securities yielding a fixed rate of interest).   The directive applies to the following companies:    limited companies  (private companies whose owners are legally responsible for their debts only to the extent of the amount of capital they invested);    limited partnerships with share capital  (part of the capital that comes from the issue of shares);    limited liability companies  .   In this directive ‘  capital company  ’ means any company, firm, association or legal person:   whose shares can be dealt on the stock exchange;   whose members may freely dispose of their shares and are only responsible for company debts to the extent of their shares;   and, as a rule, any other which operates for profit.   The directive clarifies what is meant by contributions of capital (including the formation of or conversion into a capital company or the increases in capital shareholding either by contributions of assets or by capitalisation of profits or reserves). It also defines restructuring operations such as mergers affected by the contribution of assets or by the exchange of shares.   Prohibition on levying indirect tax on the raising of capital   EU countries may not levy indirect tax on the raising of capital to capital companies.  These transactions affect the following in particular:   contributions of capital;   loans or services provided as part of contributions of capital;   registration or other formalities required before starting a business because of the company’s legal form;   alteration of the instruments constituting the company  *  ;   restructuring operations.   The directive also prohibits indirect taxes on the issue of certain securities and debentures. However, EU countries may charge certain transfer duties, fees, dues or value added tax.   Exemptions   Special rules apply to EU countries that charged a duty on contributions of capital to capital companies (capital duty)  as at 1 January 2006  . Those countries may continue to levy the duty, which must be charged at a single rate not exceeding 1% and may be charged solely on contributions of capital, i.e. capital duty may not be charged on other transactions such as restructuring operations.  Capital duty may only be levied by an EU country if the centre of effective management of the capital company is situated in that country at the time the contribution is made. In addition, capital duty can only be charged once in the EU.  Exemptions from capital duty may be applied to capital companies which supply a public service or have an exclusively cultural or social aim.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 12 March 2008. It had to become law in the EU countries by 31 December 2008.   key terms    Capital duty:  an indirect tax payable when capital companies are formed and which interferes with the free movement of capital.   Instruments constituting the company:  the company’s constitution or the legal act setting up the company.
summary of   Directive 2013/32/EU — common procedures for granting and withdrawing international protection   what is the aim of the directive   It repeals Directive  2005/85/EC  on minimum standards on procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status in the European Union (EU).   It sets up common procedures for granting and withdrawing international protection (refugee status and the protection given to people who are not refugees but who would risk serious harm if returned to their country of origin).   It seeks to ensure that international protection procedures:   are faster and more efficient;   are fairer for applicants;   meet EU-wide standards for granting and withdrawing international protection.     key points    Who is affected?   The directive covers all applications for international protection made in EU countries (with the exception of Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom (   1   )), including at borders, in territorial waters or in transit zones.   How?    It sets out clearer rules on  how to apply for international protection  , so that decisions on applications are taken faster and more efficiently than before. Specific arrangements must be made, especially at borders, to help people apply. As a rule, the initial application process (not including appeals)  must not take longer than 6 months  . Decision-makers must be specifically trained in the process and applicants must be given procedural guarantees.   In well-defined circumstances, where an application is likely to be unfounded or where there are serious national security or public order concerns, special procedures may apply, including a faster process or the processing of applications at the border.    Basic guarantees    EU countries must ensure that applicants:   have their applications examined individually, objectively and impartially;   are informed, in a language they can understand, of the process being followed, their rights and the decision made. They must be given an interpreter to help them make their case if necessary;   have the right to consult a legal adviser, at their own cost;   have the right to an effective appeal before a court or tribunal and have free legal assistance during their appeal.     EU countries cannot detain a person for the sole reason that he/she is an asylum applicant. Where an applicant is detained, EU rules must be applied as described in the revised directive on  standards for the reception of applicants for international protection  (the reception conditions directive).    Examination procedure   Before the relevant authority reaches its decision, applicants are entitled to a  personal interview  where they should have the opportunity to set out the full grounds for their application. The person conducting the interview must be competent to take into account the applicant’s personal circumstances and the general circumstances of the situation. EU countries must ensure that information on individual applications is kept confidential.   Specific guarantees for vulnerable people    People with  specific procedural needs  , for instance because of their age, disability, illness or sexual orientation, or as a consequence of trauma, or for any other reason must be given appropriate support, including sufficient time, to help them with their application process.   Specific requirements exist for  unaccompanied children  , including the obligation to appoint a qualified representative. More generally, the best interests of all children should be considered when applying the directive.    Preventing repeated applications   EU countries have new ways of dealing with repeated applications made by the same person. People who do not need protection can no longer avoid being returned to their country by constantly making new applications.   from when does the directive apply   The directive entered into force on 19 July 2013, except for Articles 47 (the possibility for public authorities to challenge administrative and/or judicial decisions as provided for in national legislation) and 48 (confidentiality as regards any information that implementing authorities obtain in the course of their work). These have applied since 21 July 2015.   EU countries had to incorporate the directive into national law by 20 July 2015, except for certain aspects of Article 31, which deals with the examination procedure, which will apply from 20 July 2018.   background    The EU has been working to create a common European asylum system since 1999. Several legislative measures were adopted between 1999 and 2005. Subsequent legislation was adopted in 2011 (the  qualification directive  ) and in 2013 (the abovementioned directive on reception conditions as well as the regulations on  Eurodac  and on the revised  system which determines which EU country is responsible for examining asylum applications  ) to improve the way the system works.   For more information, see:    ‘Common European Asylum System’  on the European Commission's website.

   Integrating the environment into aerial transport     Integrating the environment into aerial transport     The Commission evaluates ways of improving the environmental performance of activities linked to air transport in order to offset the environmental impact of growth in this sector.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 1 December 1998 to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Air Transport and the Environment [       COM(1999) 640      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Globally, air transport contributes to the greenhouse effect and to the depletion of the ozone layer. Regionally, it contributes to acidification, ozone formation and eutrophication. Locally, in the vicinity of airports, air transport is partly the cause of noise and air pollution.     This communication sets out the strategy the European Union is to pursue to put in place a coherent and environmentally friendly policy in the field of air transport.      The pillars of the strategy      The first pillar of the strategy proposed in the communication is the improvement of technical environmental standards on noise and gaseous emissions. One example of practical action is the improvement of air traffic management systems, which should allow a major saving in fuel consumption.     The communication also proposes the introduction of economic and regulatory market incentives to enhance the competitive edge of operators and users which choose to use state-of-the-art technologies and environmentally friendly operations. The Commission will work to integrate environmental costs into charging systems and to improve the infrastructure at intermodal connecting points so that users and operators can actually choose more environmentally friendly services.     Another pillar indicated in the communication is environmental protection measures to be applied in airports. Under this pillar of the Community strategy, various action is proposed to assist airports, limit noise and link airports to other modes of transport.     The communication emphasises the need to encourage research and innovation relating to the environmental performance of aircraft, including assessment of the atmospheric effect of aircraft exhaust gas emissions. A long-term strategy of this nature is essential.     The communication invites the air transport industry to sign voluntary environmental agreements and to register under the       EMAS scheme      .     The Commission underlines the importance of adopting international solutions within the       International Civil Aviation Organisation      (ICAO).     RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 27 September 2005:      Reducing the Climate Change Impact of Aviation [       COM(2005) 459      - Not published in the Official Journal].     The Commission considers the options available for reducing the impact of the air transport sector on climate change. In particular, it suggests - in addition to pursuing the possibilities offered in research, air traffic management and energy taxation - integrating the air transport sector into the Community Emissions Trading Scheme.       Directive 2002/30/EC        of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 March 2002 on the establishment of rules and procedures with regard to the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions at Community airports [Official Journal L 85 of 28 March 2002].      The purpose of this Directive is to prevent an overall increase in noise and to seek to reduce aircraft noise in order to improve the current acoustic environment, in particular by gradually phasing out the noisiest aircraft.      Communication [         COM(2000) 821        final      -       Not published in the Official Journal].      Communication from the Commission to the Council: Community objectives for the 33rd Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and ICAO Council decisions prior to this Assembly in the field of environmental protection. The communication sets out the following Community objectives:      deal with the impact, in terms of noise pollution, of the increase in demand for air transport: the Community will seek the adoption both of a resolution on limiting the operation of the least noise-efficient aircraft, and of a more stringent noise standard for aircraft;       introduce more stringent standards for all gaseous emissions from air transport;       strengthening economic incentives to improve the environmental performance of aircraft.      The 33rd ICAO Assembly was held in September 2001.

   The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia – Information society and media     The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia – Information society and media     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM (2011) 666      final – SEC(2011) 1203 – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was granted candidate country status for European Union (EU) membership in 2005. The Accession Partnership, adopted by the Council in 2008, supports the country’s preparations in view of its future membership and the alignment of its legislation with the Community       acquis      . In 2008, the accession negotiations had not yet been opened, as some progress still needed to be made on the objectives and conditions set out in the partnership.     The       2011 Report      notes progress with regard to the alignment of the legislation with the       acquis      , although the capacities of the Broadcasting Council to monitor the market remain inadequate.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission’s words)      The       acquis      includes specific rules relating to       electronic communications      ,       information society services      , particularly e-commerce and services based on conditional access, and to audiovisual services. In the field of electronic communications, the       acquis      aims at removing the obstacles preventing the smooth running of the internal market of telecommunications services and networks, at encouraging competition and at protecting consumers’ interests, specifically by guaranteeing the universal availability of modern services.     In terms of       audiovisual policy      , the       acquis      requires legislative alignment with the       Television without Frontiers Directive      which creates the conditions for the free movement of television programmes in the European Union. The       acquis      intends to define a transparent, reliable and efficient regulatory framework for public and private broadcasting which meets European standards. It also estimates the capacity for participating in the Community programmes Media Plus and Media Training.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      Progress was made in the field of       information society and media      . Alignment with the EU       acquis      is advancing and most of the key competitive safeguards were introduced. The capacity of the Broadcasting Council to monitor the market effectively remains inadequate.     RELATED ACTS      Commission Report [         COM(2010) 660        final – SEC(2010) 1327 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2010 Report presents advancements concerning alignment with the       acquis      and liberalisation of the Information Society and Media sector. In particular, progress must be made to ensure the proper functioning of public service broadcasters.      Commission Report [         COM(2009) 533        final – SEC(2009) 1334 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The October 2009 report indicates that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has progressed on audiovisual policy, having partly met its objectives. However, while the administrative capacity of the Broadcasting Council was strengthened, no efforts were made to ensure the sustainability of the public service broadcaster. Also, both still face political interference. In the field of culture, the country has made some progress and its preparations now meet the EU requirements.      Commission Report [         COM(2008) 674        final – SEC(2008) 2699 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The November 2008 report noted that some progress had been achieved in the field of audiovisual policy and that preparations in the media sector were advanced. However, certain concerns remained, in particular with regard to the financial situation of the Broadcasting Council and the public service broadcaster. In the area of culture, progress had been good. The country has been participating in the Community programme on culture.

summary of   Directive (EU) 2016/343 — strengthening certain aspects of the presumption of innocence and of the right to be present at the trial in criminal proceedings   what is the aim of the directive  It aims to guarantee:   the presumption of innocence of anyone accused or suspected of a crime by the police or justice authorities;   the right of an accused person to be present at their criminal trial.   key points    Scope    The directive applies to any individual (natural person) suspected or accused in criminal proceedings.   It applies at  all stages  of the criminal proceedings, from the moment a person is suspected or accused of having committed a criminal offence to the final verdict.    Rights   The directive sets out fundamental rights of an accused or suspected person in a criminal proceeding:    innocentuntil proven guilty    EU countries must take steps to ensure that public statements by public authorities and judicial decisions (other than those on guilt) do not refer to the person as being guilty   EU countries must also take steps to ensure that suspected or accused persons are not presented as being guilty in court or in public by physically restraining them;      burden of proof  on the prosecution;    right to remain silent  and not to incriminate oneself;    right to be present  at one’s own trial — a trial can be held in the absence of a suspected or accused person when one of these conditions is met   the person has been informed in due time of the trial and of the consequences of non-appearance   the person is represented by a mandated lawyer who they themselves were appointed by the state.      Remedies    EU countries must ensure that  effective remedies  are in place for breaches of these rights.   Where the  right to silence  or the right not to incriminate oneself has been breached, EU countries must ensure that the rights of the defence and the  fairness of the proceedings  are taken into account when assessing the statements concerned.   Where a suspected or accused person was  not present at their trial  and the above conditions were not met, they have the  right to a new trial  or to another legal remedy that allows the  merits of the case  to be determined anew (including the presentation of new evidence).   from when does the directive apply  It applies from 31 March 2016. EU countries have to incorporate it into national law by 1 April 2018.   background    Directive (EU) 2016/343 is the fourth in a series of measures to establish  minimum rules for procedural rights  across the EU in accordance with a 2009 roadmap. It follows rules on the rights to  interpretation and translation  , to  information  , and to  access to a lawyer  .   Two further directives set out  special rights  for  children in criminal proceedings  and to  legal aid in criminal proceedings  .

summary of   Regulation (EU) 2019/1238 on a pan-European Personal Pension Product (PEPP)   what is the aim of the regulation   Known as the ‘PEPP Regulation’, it establishes the legal foundation of the  pan-European personal pension product   *   (PEPP)  , by ensuring standardisation of the core product features, such as:   transparency requirements,   investment rules,   switching right and   type of investment options.     It also lays down uniform rules on registering, manufacturing, distributing and supervising personal pension products that are distributed in the European Union (  EU  ) under the PEPP designation.   The PEPP is a voluntary personal pension scheme that will complement existing public and occupational pension systems, as well as national private pension schemes.   The regulation aims to give savers more choice and provide them with more competitive personal pension products when saving for retirement, while enjoying strong consumer protection.   key points   The regulation lays down uniform rules on the core PEPP features, in particular on the following key points:   PEPP providers   *    PEPPs can be offered by a wide range of financial institutions, including insurance undertakings, asset managers, banks, certain investment firms and certain occupational pension funds.    PEPP contract    The regulation sets out the minimum requirements for the  content of the contract  agreed between  PEPP providers  and  PEPP savers   *  .    Registration of PEPPs    Providers that want to offer a PEPP need to follow a registration process. The  European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA)  registers new PEPPs in a central register, on the basis of a decision taken by national competent authorities. Once registered, the product can be provided and distributed throughout the EU.   The regulation describes in detail the  PEPP registration procedures  , the circumstances for  deregistering  a PEPP, as well as the powers of the competent authorities of the home and host EU countries.    EU passport   PEPP providers and distributors benefit from an EU passport which allows them to sell PEPPs in different EU countries. The passport allows them to access the entire EU market with a  single product registration  granted on the basis of a single set of rules.   Portability    When proposing a PEPP, providers or distributors must provide prospective PEPP savers with  information  on the portability service  *  and on which sub-accounts  *  are immediately available.   Where PEPP savers change their residence to another EU country, they can continue to contribute to the same PEPP either by opening a PEPP sub-account with the same PEPP provider in their new country of residence (where such an option is available with their PEPP provider) or continuing to contribute to their existing PEPP sub-account. In the event that their PEPP provider does not provide for such an option in their new country of residence, PEPP savers have the right to switch PEPP provider immediately and free of charge. PEPP providers must open at least 2 sub-accounts after a transition period of 3 years.    Switching   PEPP savers can switch PEPP provider after a minimum of 5 years from the conclusion of the PEPP contract and in case of subsequent switching, after 5 years from the most recent switching. The PEPP provider may allow PEPP savers to switch PEPP providers more frequently. The fees and charges for the switching service must be limited to the actual administrative costs incurred by the transferring PEPP provider and capped at 0.5% of the value of the transferred assets.   Investment options    PEPP providers can provide up to 6 investment options, including the default investment option — called the ‘Basic PEPP’  *  . All investment options must be designed by PEPP providers on the basis of a guarantee or risk-mitigation technique which ensures sufficient protection for PEPP savers.   For the Basic PEPP, PEPP providers must protect PEPP savers’ capital either by a guarantee or by risk mitigation techniques consistent with the objective to allow the PEPP savers to recoup the capital. Costs and fees for the Basic PEPP must not exceed 1% of the accumulated capital per year.   PEPP savers have the right to change investment option regularly in order to adapt their investment strategy. This right is free of charge and can be exercised after a minimum of 5 years from the conclusion of the PEPP contract and, in the case of subsequent changes, after 5 years from the most recent change of investment option. PEPP providers may allow PEPP savers to change their investment option more frequently.    Type of out-payments    PEPP providers can offer PEPP savers one or several type of out-payments (annuities, lump sum, regular drawdown payments or a combination of these).   PEPP savers can choose the form of out-payments for the decumulation phase  *  at the conclusion of a contract and when opening a new sub-account. The form of out-payments may differ from sub-account to sub-account. If PEPP providers provide different forms of out-payments, PEPP savers can modify the form of out-payments of each sub-account 1 year before the start of the decumulation phase, at the start of the decumulation phase and at the moment of switching.    Distribution of PEPPs    The regulation sets out the  conditions  under which PEPP providers and PEPP distributors  *  may distribute PEPPs.   The distribution regime of the PEPP follows a sector-by-sector approach. Insurance companies and insurance intermediaries that distribute a PEPP are subject to the  Insurance Distribution Directive  (Directive (EU)  2016/97  — IDD), while investment firms and other PEPP providers and distributors will have to apply the rules in the  Markets in Financial Instruments Directive  (Directive  2014/65/EU  — MiFID II).    Advice    PEPP providers and PEPP distributors are required to provide prospective PEPP savers with comprehensive advice before the PEPP contract is signed, in order to enable them to take a fully informed decision and choose the product that best suits their needs.   The PEPP Regulation provides for:   an obligation for all PEPP providers and distributors to do before the signature of the contract a retirement-related demands and needs test which must also cover a specific check for a possible need of PEPP savers to acquire a PEPP offering annuities (to ensure their adequate protection for longevity risks);   full mandatory advice: no waiver possible for savers and suitability test for all PEPP savers. The advice must also cover the choice of investment option and personalised pension benefit projections.     In addition, for the Basic PEPP, PEPP providers must provide PEPP savers with mandatory personalised retirement planning advice at the start of the decumulation phase, with a personal recommendation on the optimal form of out-payments.    Information    To ensure a high level of transparency, the regulation provides that PEPP savers must receive:   before the conclusion of the contract, key information about the product through a standardised document (i.e. the  PEPP key information document (PEPP KID)  );   every year, a PEPP benefit statement with key information about the evolution of their savings.     In particular, costs and fees must be fully transparent.   The  European Commission  must further specify by regulatory technical standards the details of the presentation of the information to be provided in the PEPP KID and the PEPP Benefit Statement.    Sustainability factors    PEPP providers are encouraged to take into account environmental, social and governance factors (ESG factors)  *  .   PEPP providers should provide PEPP savers with information, where available, related to the performance of the PEPP provider’s investments in terms of ESG factors.   They should also provide PEPP savers in the PEPP Benefit Statement with information on how the investment policy takes into account ESG factors. Within the prudent person rule, PEPP providers shall take into account risks related to and the potential long-term impact of investment decisions on ESG factors.    Supervision   Compliance with the PEPP Regulation must be supervised by the national competent authorities of the PEPP providers and distributors. However, EIOPA will have product intervention powers which will allow it to take effective, EU-wide measures in case of a significant PEPP saver protection concern or of a threat to the orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets or to the stability of the whole or part of the EU’s financial system, which are not adequately addressed by national competent authorities.   from when does the regulation apply  It applies 12 months after publication in the   Official Journal of the European Union   of Commission  delegated acts  concerning  regulatory technical standards  specifying:   the details of the PEPP presentation, the methodology of how risk and reward are presented, the methodology for the calculation of costs, information presented in electronic form (Article 28(5));   the conditions for the review and revision of the PEPP KID (Article 30(2));   the conditions for fulfilling the requirement to provide the PEPP KID (Article 33(3));   the key information for PEPP saver to be included in the PEPP Benefit Statement (Article 36(1));   the details of the presentation of the supplementary information in the PEPP Benefit Statement (Article 37(2));   the types of costs and fees for the Basic PEPP (Article 45(3)); and   the minimum criteria for risk-mitigation techniques (Article 46(3)).   background   For more information, see:    Personal pension products  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Personal pension product:  a product which:   is based on a contract between an individual saver and an entity on a voluntary basis and is complementary to any statutory or occupational pension product;   provides for long-term capital accumulation with the explicit objective of providing income on retirement and with limited possibilities for early withdrawal before that time;   is neither a statutory nor an occupational pension product.     PEPP provider:  a financial undertaking authorised to manufacture a PEPP and to distribute that PEPP.   PEPP saver:  an individual who has concluded a PEPP contract with a PEPP provider.   Portability service:  a service which gives PEPP savers the right to continue contributing into their existing PEPP account, when changing their residence to another EU country.   Sub-account:  a national section which is opened within each PEPP account and which corresponds to the legal requirements and conditions for using possible incentives fixed at national level for investing in a PEPP by the EU country of the PEPP saver’s residence; accordingly, an individual may be a PEPP saver or a PEPP beneficiary in each sub-account, depending on the respective legal requirements for the accumulation phase (   *6   ) (please see key term below) and decumulation phase.   Basic PEPP:  all PEPP providers will need to offer an affordable default investment option (the ‘Basic PEPP’) with costs and fees capped at 1% of the accumulated capital per year.   Decumulation phase:  the period during which assets accumulated in a PEPP account may be drawn upon to fund retirement or other income requirements.   PEPP distributor:  a financial undertaking authorised to distribute PEPPs not manufactured by it, an investment firm providing investment advice, or an insurance intermediary.   Environmental, social and governance factors (ESG factors)  a set of criteria that socially conscious investors use to screen potential investments to ensure they support the principles of sustainable development. Environmental criteria relate to how a business performs as a steward of nature. Social criteria look at how it manages relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, and the communities in which it operates. Governance criteria concern issues such as its corporate leadership and its approach to executive pay, audits, internal controls and shareholder rights.
summary of   Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 — general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and procedures for food safety    Regulation (EU) 2019/1381 — transparency and sustainability of the EU risk assessment in the food chain   what is the aim of the regulation   Known as the regulation on general food law, it strengthens the rules on the safety of food and feed in the EU.   It also sets up the  European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)  , which provides support for the scientific testing and evaluation of food and feed.   The regulation does not cover production on the farm for private use or the handling of food at home.   key points    No foods dangerous to health or unfit for consumption may be put on sale. The following factors are taken into account:   the normal conditions under which food is used by the consumer;   information provided to the consumer;   the effect on health, in the short and long term;   cumulative toxic effects;   the particular health sensitivities of a specific category of consumers where the food is intended for that category of consumers.     If any unsafe food or feed is part of a batch, it is assumed that the whole batch is unsafe.   Food legislation applies at  all stages of the food chain  , from production, processing, transport and distribution to supply. In particular,  food businesses must  :   guarantee the  traceability  of food, feed and food-producing animals at all stages of production and distribution,   immediately  withdraw food or feed from the market  , or  recall  products already supplied, if these are considered to be harmful to health,    inform the appropriate authorities  , and consumers where necessary.     EFSA provides scientific and technical support to the  European Commission  and EU countries in all areas impacting on food safety. It is also responsible for coordinating risk assessments, identifying emerging risks and advising on crisis management.   Where risk is identified following a health risk analysis, EU countries and the Commission may adopt provisional precautionary measures consistent with a high level of health protection.   The  rapid alert system  for food and feed (  RASFF  ) involving EU countries, the Commission and EFSA, provides for information sharing on:   measures to restrict the circulation of food, or its withdrawal from the market;   action taken to prevent, limit or impose specific conditions on the placing on the market or the eventual use of food or feed;   the rejection of a batch of imported food.     This information must also be made available to the general public where appropriate.   Where food or feed presents a serious and uncontainable risk to health or the environment, the Commission’s  emergency protective measures  can include suspending trade in or imports of the product. EU countries may take similar measures if the Commission fails to take action.   Together with EFSA and EU countries, the Commission must draw up a  general crisis-management plan  to cover situations where the standard emergency protective measures are insufficient. Where such a case is identified the Commission must immediately set up a  crisis unit  to identify the options for protecting human health.   The EU also aims to protect consumers against fraudulent or deceptive practices in the food trade, such as food adulteration (for example, horsemeat in beef products), and provide a basis for consumers to make informed choices about food.   Regulation (EU) 2019/1381 on the transparency and sustainability of the EU risk assessment in the food chain amends mainly Regulation (EC) No 178/2002. It seeks to do the following.    Ensure more transparency  : The public will have automatic access to all studies and information submitted in support of any request addressed to the EFSA, e.g. to all studies supporting a request for an authorisation by a food business operator, early on in the risk assessment process. Duly justified confidential information will not be disclosed. Stakeholders and the general public will also be consulted on these submitted studies. The feedback received with allow EFSA to have access to the widest evidence base possible before it delivers its scientific advice.    Increase the independence and robustness of submitted scientific studies  : EFSA will be notified of all studies, when these are commissioned, with a view to a future application procedure, during the pre-submission phase. This will guarantee that companies applying for authorisations submit all relevant information and do not hold back unfavourable studies. EFSA will also provide general advice to applicants, in particular  small and medium-sized enterprises  , prior to the submission of the dossier. The Commission may ask EFSA to commission additional studies for verification purposes in exceptional circumstances of serious controversies or conflicting results. The Commission will also perform fact-finding missions to verify the compliance of laboratories with the applicable standards for carrying out studies submitted to EFSA. The outcome of the fact-finding missions will be presented in an overview report.    Strengthen governance and scientific cooperation  : EU countries,  civil society  and the  European Parliament  will be involved in the governance of EFSA by being duly represented in its management board. EU countries will encourage EFSA’s scientific capacity to develop, for example, by means of joint projects and the sharing of best practices, and will undertake promotion activities to ensure the recruitment of the best independent experts in EFSA’s work.    Develop comprehensive risk communication  : a general plan for risk communication will be adopted by means of an implementing act to ensure a comprehensive risk communication framework throughout the risk-analysis process, combined with open dialogue amongst all interested parties.   from when does the regulation apply  Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 has applied since 21 February 2002.  The new rules contained in amending Regulation (EU) 2019/1381 apply as of 27 March 2021.   background   Regulation (EU) 2019/1381 also amends another 8 sectoral acts (i.e. acts on specific related sectors), as far as transparency aspects are concerned:   Directive  2001/18/EC  on the  deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms  ,   Regulation (EC) No  1829/2003  on  genetically modified food and feed  ,   Regulation (EC) No  1831/2003  on  feed additives  ,   Regulation (EC) No  2065/2003  on  smoke flavourings  ,   Regulation (EC) No  1935/2004  on  food contact materials  ,   Regulation (EC) No  1331/2008  on the  common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings  ,   Regulation (EC) No  1107/2009  on  plant protection products  and   Regulation (EU) No  2015/2283  on  novel foods  .

act   Regulation (EC) No  850/2004  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on persistent organic pollutants and amending Directive 79/117/EEC.   summary    what does this regulation do  It creates a legal framework to protect human health and the environment by prohibiting, phasing out as soon as possible or restricting the production, placing on the market and use of POPs. It also lays down rules for dealing with stockpiles and waste containing POPs.   key points    POPs are broken down into lists in the annexes to the regulation: (Annex I) substances subject to prohibition; (Annex II) substances subject to restrictions; (Annex III) substances subjected to release reduction; and (Annex IV) substances subject to waste management provisions.   There are some conditions when POPs are exempted from this regulation’s control measures, such as when they are used for laboratory research or if they occur as unintentional trace contaminants in other substances.   EU countries must set up inventories for unintentionally produced POPs, draw up national implementation plans, monitor POPs in close cooperation with the European Commission and engage in information exchanges with both other EU countries and non-EU countries.   This regulation implements two international conventions that address POPs in the European Union: the  1998 Aarhus Protocol  to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Persistent Organic Pollutants, and the 2001  Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants  .   key terms   *  Persistent organic pollutants  (POPs) are chemical substances, such as pesticides or industrial chemicals, which stay in the environment, migrate into the food chain, and threaten human health and the environment.  It is very common for POPs to be transported very far from their source of origin, thus making it a truly global problem.

summary of   Decision (EU) 2018/646 on a common framework for the provision of better services for skills and qualifications (Europass)   what is the aim of the decision  It updates the  Europass  service to help people communicate their skills, qualifications and experience using standardised templates. This aims to meet the evolving needs of:   individual users, such as learners, job-seekers, employers, workers and volunteers;   relevant stakeholders, such as education, training and youth work providers, guidance providers, employers, public employment services, trades unions, youth organisations and policymakers.   Europass is based on web-based tools and relevant available information. Its use is entirely voluntary.  The decision repeals Decision No  2241/2004/EC  .   key points   Europass uses an online platform to provide:   web-based tools to   document and describe personal information in a variety of formats, including CV templates;   document and describe  skills   *  and qualifications acquired thorough work or education;   assess and self-assess skills;   access  Europass supplement   *  templates;     information on and links to   learning opportunities;   qualifications and their frameworks and systems;   opportunities to validate non-formal and informal learning;   mutual recognition practices in different countries;   learning and career guidance for those looking abroad;   resources of relevant EU-level activities and agencies;   skills and qualifications of use to a non-EU national coming to, or living in, the EU.     The online platform and the web-based tools and content:   are user-friendly, secure, free of charge and accessible to people with disabilities;   permit reuse by national authorities and other stakeholders;   allow users to store data, such as a personal profile;   exist in all EU official languages;   support services to authenticate digital documents.   Europass supplements:   are issued by national authorities using the relevant template;   are developed and updated by the  European Commission  in close cooperation with national governments, stakeholders,  Council of Europe  and the  United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO)  ;   are issued free of charge, preferably electronically, in the national (or where possible another European) language;   do not replace, or formally recognise, an original diploma or certificate.   The Commission:   manages the online platform;   ensures the active participation of national authorities and stakeholders in implementing and developing the system;   provides for exchange of best practice;   ensures effective and adequate EU-wide promotion, guidance and information is available for users and stakeholders;   must submit an evaluation report to the  European Parliament  and the  Council  by 23 May 2023 and again every 5 years.   EU countries’ national authorities are responsible for implementing the system and providing it with the necessary support and visibility, including links to relevant national websites.  The Europass system:   respects EU  personal data protection  legislation, especially Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the  protection of personal data  and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 on  the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies  ;   is open to other European countries;   receives EU co-financing.   from when does the decision apply  It has applied since 22 May 2018.   background   On 10 June 2016, the Commission issued a communication ‘  The New Skills Agenda for Europe  ’. This was designed to make skills more visible and comparable to help individuals make better career choices.  One of its 10 proposals was to update the original Europass framework adopted in 2004 (Decision No 2241/2004/EC). This contains a set of 5 templates to help people identify their skills and qualifications to create CVs and portfolios.  Europass aims to reach all potential users, including the less-well educated, the elderly, the long-term unemployed and people with disabilities, as well as the highly educated and digitally literate.  Since 2005, over 93 million document templates have been downloaded and over 60 million Europass CVs created online.  For more information, see:    Europass  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Skills:  what a person knows, understands and can do through formal, informal or non-formal learning.   Europass supplements:  documents, such as diplomas and certificates, issued by the relevant authority.   related document   Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions — A New Skills Agenda for Europe: Working together to strengthen human capital, employability and competitiveness (  COM(2016) 381 final  , 10.6.2016)
   Fight against organised crime and terrorism: role of Eurojust and the European Judicial Network     Fight against organised crime and terrorism: role of Eurojust and the European Judicial Network     The Commission takes stock of the transposition of the Decision setting up Eurojust. Following its examination, it proposes granting wider powers to the national members and the College. It also wishes to clarify and simplify the relations between this law enforcement cooperation unit and its partners (European Judicial Network, Europol, OLAF, Frontex and non-EU countries).     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 23 October 2007 on the role of Eurojust and the European Judicial Network in the fight against organised crime and terrorism in the European Union [       COM(2007) 644      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Eurojust has strengthened law enforcement cooperation between Member States and achieved significant operational success. The transposition of       Decision 2002/187/JHA      is on balance a qualified success. To develop Eurojust more effectively, the powers of its members (known as national members) and those of the College, formed by the assembly of national members, need to be clarified and reinforced.     The Commission calls for an amendment to the Decision establishing Eurojust in order to enable the agency to develop its potential for cooperation and to establish itself as a vital player in the fight against organised crime and terrorism in Europe.      Granting wider powers to the national members      The statute and competences of each national member are defined by the Member State which appoints them. This situation leads to a lack of consistency between the powers of the different national members and makes it difficult at present to achieve fully effective cooperation. Furthermore, Member States do not confer real authority on them. Therefore, only a few national members may negotiate setting up       joint investigation teams      and use their law enforcement powers in their home country.     For greater stability and effectiveness, the Member States should take measures to spell out the powers of the national members and the college and define a shared base of minimum powers.     To increase Eurojust's operational capacity, Member States are called upon to send their information to Eurojust more quickly, and also to reinforce their national offices. They will also make use of the services of national experts.      Possible amendments to increase the powers of the national members      The Commission suggests the Decision by proposing that the national members can:      accept and forward requests from national authorities and ensure that they are properly followed up;       receive judgments from national authorities in cases of money laundering, organised crime, terrorism and human trafficking;       forward this information to the national member of a Member State which is not informed but which is involved;       be informed of the setting up of a Joint Investigation Team and suggest investigative measures;       request further follow-up measures and additional investigations from the authority concerned;       be informed about the organisation of a controlled delivery, an infiltration or an undercover investigation and have responsibility for monitoring it;       be appointed for a term of at least three years;       have deputies to ensure regular representation.      In the longer term, the Commission will examine how to reinforce the powers of the national members in the initiation of criminal cases prejudicial to the financial interests of the European Union (EU).      Granting wider powers to the college      The College has the same powers as the national members. Although the College rules on conflicts of jurisdiction and on competing arrest warrants, its decisions are not binding on the Member States. Its powers should be widened and its role as mediator in resolving conflicts between Member States strengthened. The latter in fact refer to the College only to obtain information on the steps to be taken where disagreements arise.     The Commission undertakes to consider the conditions on which the College will be able to:      settle conflicts between Member States;       launch inquiries in a Member State and propose prosecution;       play a role in specific investigation measures;       initiate criminal inquiries at European level.       Relations between Eurojust, the European Judicial Network and the liaison magistrates      The       European Judicial Network      (EJN) facilitates judicial cooperation between Member States, in particular through its Internet site on the systems of justice in Europe. However, cooperation between the network and Eurojust must be improved. The Commission hopes that each Eurojust member will become attached to a national correspondent who will be one of the European Judicial Network contact points. This correspondent would be part of the Eurojust member’s team. S/he would be a relay for Eurojust’s communication policy in their Member State and would forward the cases to be examined promptly to the national member.     In the future, Eurojust could themselves designate the liaison magistrates in countries outside the EU so as to facilitate judicial cooperation between the Member States and the countries concerned.      Stepping up cooperation with Europol      The links between Eurojust and       Europol      have constantly improved. The secure communications network has facilitated the exchange of information between them and access to Europol's analytical work files. Finally, the expert meetings on Joint Investigation Team have achieved high quality work.     However, cooperation between Eurojust and the Europol national liaison offices is still uneven. The links should be strengthened and exchanges of data with these offices should be improved.      Cooperation with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), Frontex and non-EU countries      The fields of responsibility of Eurojust and       OLAF      are complementary. The Commission therefore proposes to establish a regular exchange of information between the two agencies in order to strengthen cooperation. It also emphasises the need to continue to appoint contact points and establish regular meetings between Eurojust and OLAF.     The protection of the EU's external borders is important in connection with       illegal immigration      and organised crime. The Commission encourages the signing of a cooperation agreement between       Frontex      and Eurojust.     Eurojust has signed agreements with third countries aimed at developing an exchange of personal data and information between judicial authorities. These agreements have led to sending of liaison officers to Eurojust. The agency now wishes to develop a veritable network of contact points.     Last updated: 14.10.2011  
summary of   Decision 2004/889/EC concluding an agreement between the European Community and China on cooperation and mutual administrative assistance in customs matters    Agreement between the European Community and China on cooperation and mutual administrative assistance in customs matters   what is the aim of the agreement and of the decision  The agreement aims to improve cooperation between the parties’ administrative authorities responsible for the application of customs legislation  *  .  The decision concludes the agreement on behalf of the European Community (now the  EU  ).   key points   Action to tackle operations in breach of customs legislation is more effective if it is backed up by mutual assistance between countries in customs matters. The operations concerned are those prejudicial to the economic, fiscal and commercial interests of the parties: it is essential to any state to ensure the accurate assessment of customs duties and other taxes.   Developing customs cooperation   The parties agree to develop customs cooperation, in particular by:   establishing channels of communication;   facilitating effective coordination between administrative authorities;   providing for joint action on administrative matters;   facilitating the legitimate movement of goods;   exchanging information and expertise on customs procedures;   providing each other with technical assistance, e.g. staff exchanges, training and data sharing;   seeking a coordinated position when customs topics are discussed in international organisations.    Mutual administrative assistance   Customs authorities assist each other by providing information to ensure the proper application of customs legislation: this does not prejudice the application of existing rules governing mutual assistance in criminal matters. Nor does it apply to information obtained at the request of judicial authorities.  The following forms of assistance are not covered by the agreement:   the recovery of duties, taxes or fines;   the arrest or detention of any person;   the seizure or detention of property.   The agreement concerns both  assistance on request  and  spontaneous assistance  .   Assistance on request  : the requested authority must give the applicant authority all information which may enable it to ensure that customs legislation is correctly applied. This information may relate to:   activities that may result in offences within the territory of the other party, such as incorrect declarations or other falsified documents;   the authenticity of official documents produced in support of a goods declaration;   the legality of exports and imports of goods from the territory of one of the parties to the territory of the other and the customs procedure applied.   The requested authority must also, in the context of its competence and at the request of the applicant authority, take the necessary steps to ensure  special surveillance  . Surveillance relates to persons in respect of whom there are reasonable grounds for believing that they have committed an infringement of the customs legislation of one of the parties. It can also cover places, stocks and goods transported, as well as means of transport that may have been used under fraudulent conditions.   Spontaneous assistance  : in cases where a formal request is not possible in view of the urgency of a situation that could involve substantial damage to the economy, public health, public security or similar vital interest, the parties can assist each other at their own initiative.   Formal aspects and exceptions to the obligation to provide assistance   Requests must comply with certain requirements of form and substance in relation to:   the formal endorsement of the applicant authority;   the action requested;   the object of and the reason for the request.   The requested authority proceeds as though it were acting on its own account. It deals with the requests in accordance with the legally binding instruments applicable in its own jurisdiction. The response must be in writing.  Exceptions to the obligation to provide assistance are allowed. Assistance may be refused or may be subject to certain requirements if it is likely to prejudice:   the sovereignty of China or that of an EU country which has been requested to provide assistance;   public order, security or other essential interests.   The agreement contains confidentiality clauses in relation to the information provided.   date of entry into force   The agreement entered into force on 1 April 2005. It applies to the customs territory of the People’s Republic of China and to the territories of the 28 EU countries.   background   The European Commission and the General Administration of Customs of the People’s Republic of China signed the  Strategic Framework for Customs Cooperation 2018-2020  in June 2017. This reiterates the main objectives of mutual cooperation and assistance between the EU and China and builds upon the agreement on cooperation and mutual administrative assistance in customs matters. The priorities identified include the enforcement of intellectual property rights, supply chain security, fight against fraud (financial and environmental) and statistics. The new Strategic Framework also introduces cooperation on matters concerning e-commerce.   key terms    Customs legislation:  customs legislation includes any legal provisions of the EU or of China which govern the import, export and transit of goods or their placing under any other customs regime or procedure, including measures of prohibition, restriction and control.   main documents   Council Decision  2004/889/EC  of 16 November 2004 on the conclusion of an Agreement between the European Community and the Government of the People’s Republic of China on cooperation and mutual administrative assistance in customs matters (OJ L 375, 23.12.2004, p. 19)   Agreement  between the European Community and the Government of the People’s Republic of China on cooperation and mutual administrative assistance in customs matters (OJ L 375, 23.12.2004, pp. 20-26)
   Croatia – Employment and Social Affairs     Croatia – Employment and Social Affairs     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM(2010) 660      final – SEC(2010) 1326 - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The       2010 Report      notes a good level of alignment, but also shortcomings concerning labour law, social protection, protection against discrimination and equality between men and women. The functioning of social dialogue should also be improved.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission’s words)      The       acquis      in the social field includes minimum standards in areas such as labour law, equal treatment of women and men in employment and social security, and health and safety at work. The European Social Fund (ESF) is the main financial tool through which the EU supports the implementation of its Employment Strategy and contributes to social inclusion efforts (implementation rules are covered under Chapter 22, which deals with all structural instruments). The Member States participate in social dialogue at European level and in EU policy processes in the areas of employment policy, social inclusion and social protection.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      Good progress has been made on       social policy and employment      . There is a good level of alignment with the       acquis      .     However, some gaps remain in alignment of the legislation, notably on transposing       labour law      directives, and in the field of       anti-discrimination      and       gender equality      .      Administrative capacity      requires further strengthening.     RELATED ACTS      Commission Report [         COM(2009) 533        final – SEC(2009) 1333 final – Not published in the Official Journal].      The October 2009 Report noted a satisfactory level of alignment of Croatian legislation with the Community       acquis      . However, the country’s administrative capacity had to be strengthened in order to guarantee the effective transposition and appropriate implementation of the       acquis      in this area.      Commission Report [         COM(2008) 674        final – SEC(2008) 2694 final – Not published in the Official Journal].

act   Regulation (EU) No  1295/2013  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 establishing the Creative Europe Programme (2014 to 2020) and repealing Decisions No 1718/2006/EC, No 1855/2006/EC and No 1041/2009/EC.   summary   An estimated 8.5 million people are directly employed in Europe's cultural sector. Europe's diversity of cultures and traditions can often mean that the sector faces  market fragmentation  , making it hard for authors and performers to reach international audiences in countries and find their market.  In addition,  globalisation  and  digital technologies  are revolutionising creativity and the way the arts are distributed and accessed, as well as transforming business models and the way artists are remunerated. And there is little comparable data at European level which would help fine-tune the support provided to the cultural and creative sectors. This programme seeks both to address these challenges and harness their potential benefits.  Actions covered by the programme include:    Cultural initiatives  : promoting cross-border cooperation, platforms to promote emerging artists, networking, and literary translation;    Audiovisual sector initiatives  : promoting the development, production, distribution, or access to audiovisual works;    A cross-sectoral strand  : including a Guarantee Facility to fund micro, small and medium-sized organisations and transnational policy cooperation.    Management   The programme is managed by the  Education, Culture and Audiovisual Executive Agency  in Brussels.   Eligibility   The programme is open to European Union (EU) countries and, provided that they meet certain conditions, EFTA countries, candidate and potential candidate countries to EU membership, and countries that are part of the EU neighbourhood policy area (Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya,Moldova, Morocco, Palestine, Syria, Tunisia and Ukraine).   Budget   Creative Europe has a budget of  EUR 1.46 billion  for the period 2014-2020. Non-EU countries have to pay a contribution to participate in the programme.

   European space policy     European space policy     Space has long been a source of progress for Europe, serving numerous objectives and policies, including transport and mobility, the information society and industrial competitiveness, the environment, agriculture and fisheries, and civil protection. The aim is to make the European Union (EU) the most advanced knowledge-based society in the world.     ACT     Commission Green Paper of 21 January 2003 on European Space Policy [       COM(2003) 17      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The       Galileo      project (civil satellite navigation and positioning system) and the       GMES      (global monitoring for environment and security) initiative are examples of a new approach underlining the need for the EU to play a more important role in       space policy      .     The objective of this Green Paper is to raise awareness in European society as a whole of the strategic importance of space and space policy to the EU and to find practical answers to the questions of access, funding and institutional regulation.     The Green Paper is the fruit of close and effective cooperation between the European Commission and the European Space Agency (       ESA      ).      EUROPEAN SPACE IN A CHANGING CONTEXT      Since 1980 Ariane and the space centre in Guyana have given Europe independent and reliable access to space, allowing it considerable freedom of initiative for achieving its ambitions in space. However, Europe's competitiveness in space must be based on new technical developments combined with a renewed method of public support for using space.     Today the total turnover of the European space industry is in the order of EUR 5.5 billion a year. At the same time the European space industry directly employs 30 000 people, spread over about 2 000 companies.      Priorities for the future:       guarantee European access to space and long-term funding for this purpose;       split responsibilities between national and European players;       strike a balance between European autonomy and international cooperation: Europe must take the initiative and intervene on a par with its partners by playing a strategic role in major cooperative space projects;       make available a high-quality industrial structure and have access to key technologies: Europe must identify the sectors offering added value and decide if it wants to maintain an industrial base covering the whole chain of space activities;       ensure a broad and efficient technological base maintained through research and demonstration programmes: the EU, the ESA, the national players and the industry have established various instruments (the space technology plan, the         Seventh Framework RTD Programme        and the national research programmes);       continue the transfer of know-how and information between generations of scientists and engineers: in Europe it is estimated that nearly 30% of employees in the space sector are due to retire in the next 10 years.       PLACING SPACE MORE AT THE SERVICE OF EUROPE AND ITS CITIZENS      The technical potential of the space community needs to be used in a manner responding to the new demands made by society. The objective is to create a competitive knowledge-society, with the aim of ensuring that all European citizens, notably those with special requirements, will be able to have access to advanced technologies and services.     Beyond extremely widespread use of telecommunication satellites for exchanging information (telephony, television and digital data transmission), placing European launchers in orbit offers businesses, public authorities and citizens a wide range of services such as more sustainable mobility, weather forecasting, monitoring of climate change, faster response to natural disasters, etc.      Priorities for the future:       broaden the range of space research to players other than the conventional space industry: encourage transfers from research activities to industrial applications and value added services which go beyond the strict context of space;       transfer technologies from the research sector to the commercial sector: encourage private investment through long-term commitments by the public authorities;       develop new applications which make optimum use of the benefits of earth and space technologies;       maintain the interests of an enlarged Union: all European citizens, including the population of the new Member States, will be able to benefit from high-quality services if the EU introduces, for example, new broadband space systems;       support sustainable development: space technology is used for Earth observation, particularly for meteorological and environmental purposes to monitor changes on the planet (climate, meteorology, oceans, vegetation, global warming, monitoring oil slicks at sea, etc.);       contribute to the development of satellite navigation systems offering new opportunities for navigation in the air, at sea and on land;       improve the security of citizens: crisis management depends directly on mastering space technologies, particularly military applications.       TOWARDS A MORE EFFICIENT AND AMBITIOUS ORGANISATION AND FRAMEWORK      The ESA, set up in 1975, met the initial objective of bringing together the resources and skills required for developing an integrated space science programme backed up by the national agencies of certain Member States, operational bodies and space initiatives.      Priorities for the future:       optimise Europe's strengths in the space field, complying with the subsidiarity principle to set new objectives;       ensure that the contributions made by various institutional players converge towards common objectives;       define the responsibilities of the institutions involved in respect of space - in particular development agencies and operational structures - and their relationship with the private sector;       develop the space industry within a transparent and stable regulatory framework to motivate decision-makers and investors: efforts are being made to simplify procedures and minimise the regulatory barriers.       Background      The publication of the Green Paper marked the start of a period for official consultations which ended on 30 May 2003. An action plan (White Paper of 11 November 2003 -       PDF      ) to implement the European space policy was drawn up on the basis of the replies sent in by interested parties. The Communication from the Commission of May 2005 (       PDF      ) lays the foundations for a European space programme within the EU's new institutional and technological context (development of Galileo and GMES).

This White Paper is the follow-up to the consultation period launched by the Green Paper of January 2003. It puts forward an action plan for a European space policy to foster competitiveness and sustainable development in the EU. The Galileo and GMES programmes are actual examples of space technologies helping to achieve the EU's policy objectives.      Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - "A Regions: "A Coherent Framework for Aerospace - A Response to the STAR 21 Coherent Framework for Aerospace - A Response to the STAR 21 Report" Report" [         COM(2003) 600        final - Not [         COM(2003) 600        final - Not Published in the Official Journal].      This strategy proposes providing political support for action by both the public and private sectors in order to define a Community political approach to space.     The communication proposes the basic components and broad lines of a space strategy revolving around three objectives:      strengthen and preserve independent and affordable access to space;       enhance scientific knowledge;       reap the benefits of the technical capabilities of the space community for markets and society.

   Green Paper on Mental Health     Green Paper on Mental Health     With this Green Paper, the Commission is launching a wide debate on mental health. The idea is to hold a public consultation on how to improve the management of mental illness and promote mental well-being in the European Union.     ACT     Commission Green Paper of 14 October 2005 - "Improving the mental health of the population - Towards a strategy on mental health for the European Union" [       COM(2005) 484      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY      Current situation      Mental health is a growing challenge for the European Union (EU). It is estimated that mental health problems affect more than one in four adults in Europe and are the cause of the majority of the 58 000 annual deaths from suicide, an act which takes more lives than road traffic accidents.     The most common forms of mental ill health       *      are anxiety disorders and depression. According to some studies, by the year 2020 depression may be the highest ranking cause of disease in the developed world.     3.Stigmatisation is still a real problem for those suffering from mental illness. People with mental ill health or disability meet fear and prejudice from others, which increases personal suffering and social exclusion.     In economic terms, mental ill health costs the EU the equivalent of 3 to 4% of GDP because of lost productivity and additional burdens on the health, social, educational and justice systems.     There are significant inequalities between Member States in relation to mental health       *      . Suicide rates, for example, range from 3.6 per 100 000 population in Greece to 44 per 100 000 in Lithuania, the highest in the world. In addition, the number of involuntary placements in psychiatric institutions is 40 times higher in Finland than in Portugal.      The need for an EU strategy on mental health      Establishing a strategy on mental health at EU level would add value by:      creating a framework for exchange and cooperation between Member States;       helping to increase the coherence of actions in different policy sectors;       opening up a platform for involving stakeholders in building solutions.      The Commission proposes that an EU strategy could focus on the following aspects:      promoting the mental health of all;       addressing mental ill health through preventive action;       improving the quality of life of people with mental ill health or disability through social inclusion and the protection of their rights and dignity;       developing a mental health information, research and knowledge system for the EU.       Three areas of action envisaged      The Green Paper proposes three main areas of action at EU level:      Next steps      All interested citizens, parties and organisations are invited to share their comments on this Green Paper.     In late 2006 the Commission will present its analysis of the responses received together with, if appropriate, its proposals for a strategy on mental health for the EU.      Background      The Green Paper is part of the Commission's response to the WHO European Ministerial Conference on Mental Health held in Helsinki in January 2005. The Conference created strong political commitment for mental health and established a framework for comprehensive action. It invited the European Commission to contribute to implementing this framework for action. This Green Paper is an initial response to that invitation.       Key terms used in the act         The WHO describes mental health as: "a state of well-being in which the individual realises his or her abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community".         Mental ill health includes mental health problems and strain, impaired functioning associated with stress, symptoms of dementia and diagnosable mental disorders, such as schizophrenia and depression.       RELATED ACTS      Council conclusions of 3 June 2005 on a Community action in the field of mental health [Not published in the Official Journal].      In these       conclusions      , the Council calls on the Member States and the Commission to take measures to provide information on mental health, promote its importance and pre-empt mental disorders.      Conclusions of the "Employment, social policy, health and consumer affairs" Council of 2 and 3 June 2003 on combating stigma and discrimination in relation to mental health.      In these conclusions, the Council stresses the impact of problems associated with       stigma and discrimination in relation to mental illness      . The Council thus calls for specific measures to improve social inclusion and to tackle discrimination and stigma.      Council conclusions of 15 November 2001 on combating stress and depression-related problems [Official Journal C 6 of 09.01.2002].

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 1920/2006 on the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction   what is the aim of the regulation  It  revises  and repeals Regulation (EEC) No  302/93  which originally set up the  European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA)  .  It extends the Centre’s role to monitoring aspects such as new trends in drug use, especially  poly-drug use  (where illegal drugs are taken in combination with legal drugs or medication).  The regulation was amended by Regulation (EU)  2017/2101  as regards information exchange on, and an  early warning system  and  risk assessment procedure  for,  new psychoactive substances   *  (NPSs).   key points   The Centre:   supplies the EU institutions and EU countries with objective, reliable and comparable data on drugs and drug addiction;   offers policymakers the data they need to draw up informed drug laws and strategies;   provides professionals and practitioners with   examples of best practice   new areas of research on drugs and the consequences of drug addiction.     Its main objectives are to:   collect and analyse existing data on drugs and drug addiction  in the EU and with participating non-EU countries  ;   compare data to help evaluate national and EU drugs policies;   disseminate data and information on the drugs situation, including data on emerging trends;   cooperate with EU agencies such as  Europol  and  Eurojust  or specialised United Nations agencies such as the  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime  and with non-EU countries;   share information on, support the early warning system for, and carry out risk assessments of, new psychoactive substances.    Priority areas   The Centre concentrates on:   monitoring the drugs situation and emerging trends, in particular those involving poly-drug use;   monitoring the solutions applied to drug-related problems and facilitating exchanges on best practice among EU countries;   maintaining an early warning system and assessing the risks of new psychoactive substances;   developing tools to help the European Commission and EU countries to monitor and evaluate their respective policies on drugs.    Reitox network   To achieve its main task of providing sound and comparable information on drugs, the EMCDDA has developed a tool to collect national data in a harmonised way through the  Reitox network  .  Reitox links national drug information systems and is the main means by which the EMCDDA exchanges data and methodological information on drugs and drug addiction in the EU.  Data collected through the Reitox network are also used to:   monitor the implementation of the EU drugs action plans which implement the  EU drugs strategy  ;   help develop recommendations for appropriate national responses for organising treatment, prevention and harm reduction activities.   The network consists of  one focal point  for each EU country that participates in EMCDDA and a focal point for the  Commission  .   Strengthened surveillance and risk assessment procedure   Regulation (EU) 2017/2101 requires EU countries to ensure that their national focal points and Europol national units provide the centre with information they collect on NPS.  Working closely with Europol, EMCDDA collects, collates, analyses and assesses the information and sends it rapidly to the national focal points, to the Europol national units, and to the Commission. This ensures they all receive information as quickly as possible for the purposes of  early warning  and also allows the Centre to draw up the  initial report  on an NPS where there are concerns that the substance may pose health or social risks EU-wide.  Within 2 weeks of receiving an initial report, the Commission may request the Centre to assess the potential risks posed by the NPS and to prepare a  risk assessment report  . The Centre must submit the risk assessment report within 6 weeks of the Commission’s request. Based on the risk assessment procedure, the Commission decides whether the NPS in question should be included in the definition of ‘drug’ in accordance with the procedure under Council Framework Decision  2004/757/JHA  —  Criminal acts and the applicable penalties — drug trafficking  .   Organisation and operation   Established in 1993 in Lisbon (Portugal), the centre, which is one of the EU’s  decentralised agencies  , comprises a  Management Board  , assisted by:   a Budget Committee;   an Executive Committee; and   a  Scientific Committee  which delivers opinions on any scientific aspect of the centre’s activities.   The centre maintains close links with the Reitox network’s  national focal points  and with other partner organisations. It carries out its tasks in line with its strategy which defines the main objectives of its work for a specific period. Its  strategy  that runs to 2025 and  programme  for 2018-2020 both aim to contribute to a  more secure and a healthier Europe  . The programme focuses on:   reviewing and improving the existing  drug monitoring tools  (complemented by the increased use of innovative approaches to identify, track and monitor new trends);   ongoing  implementation of Regulation (EU) 2017/2101  on NPS;   improving the format and content of the  annual European Drug Report  ; and   the release of the next editions of the  EMCDDA–Europol EU Drug Markets Report  (2019) and the  Health and social responses to drug use: a European guide  (2020).   The Centre is also scaling up its support for the  European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs  and over the 3-year period plans to:   implement a new Reitox Development Framework and a new EMCDDA International Cooperation Framework;   enhance its work with priority non-EU countries by implementing Commission-funded technical assistance projects for  candidate  and  potential candidate countries  (  IPA 6  and IPA 7 projects) and for  neighbouring countries  (EU4 Monitoring Drugs project) respectively to gain a better understanding of the global dimension of the drug phenomenon.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 16 January 2007. Regulation (EC) No 1920/2006  revised  and replaced Regulation (EEC) No  302/93  (and its subsequent amendments).   background   For more information, see:    EMCDDA, your reference point on drugs in Europe  (  EMCDDA  ).   key terms    Psychoactive substances:  a substance, in pure form or in a preparation, that is not covered by the  1961 United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, as amended by the 1972 Protocol, or by the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances  but may pose health or social risks similar to those posed by the substances covered by those Conventions. These are substances which affect the mind when ingested.
summary of   Regulation (EU) 2017/852 — protecting human health and the environment from exposure to mercury and mercury compounds   what is the aim of the regulation  It seeks to protect human health and the environment by laying down measures and conditions concerning:   the use and storage of and trade in mercury, mercury compounds and mixtures of mercury;   the production and use of and trade in mercury-added products (i.e. products to which mercury is intentionally added to perform the function for which the product is intended);   the management of mercury waste.   key points    Trade, manufacture and storage of mercury   The regulation bans:    exports  of mercury compounds and mixtures of mercury listed in Annex I as of 1 January 2018, depending on the compounds in question;    imports  of mercury and mixtures of mercury from sources such as the chlor-alkali industry — other than for their disposal as waste;   the  use  of mercury and mercury compounds in manufacturing processes in which:   mercury or mercury compounds are used as  catalysts   *  (since 1 January 2018)   mercury is used as an  electrode   *  (as of 1 January 2022);     the  export, import and production  in the EU of mercury-added products from 31 December 2018 or 31 December 2020, depending on the product in question;    artisanal and small-scale gold mining and processing  in which mercury amalgamation is used to extract gold from ore.    Dental amalgam    From 1 July 2018, mercury amalgam must no longer be used in fillings of milk teeth, the dental treatment of children under 15 and of breastfeeding or pregnant women.   EU countries must prepare a national plan on the measures they will use to phase out the use of dental amalgam.    Waste management    Waste facility operators may temporarily store mercury waste in liquid form if specific requirements for its storage are met and the storage is in a dedicated above-ground location that is appropriately equipped.   Temporary storage may not exceed 5 years (i.e. until 1 January 2023), although there is a possibility for an extension of 3 years.    Traceability   The regulation introduces a system to ensure traceability throughout the length of the mercury waste management chain. Waste producers and mercury waste facility operators must keep an information register.   Minamata Convention   The regulation enables the EU and EU countries to approve, ratify and implement the  2013 Minamata Convention  on mercury signed by the EU and EU countries, and ensures that EU law is in line with the convention.   National law   EU countries may  apply stricter requirements  than those laid down in this regulation.   Review   The  European Commission  must report by 30 June 2020 on the outcome of the phasing out of dental amalgam. By 2024, it will prepare a report on the implementation and possible review of this regulation.   Repeal   The regulation repeals Regulation (EC) No  1102/2008  with effect from 1 January 2018.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 13 June 2017 except for point (d) of Part I of Annex III (relating to chlor-alkali production in which mercury is used as an electrode) which has applied since 11 December 2017.   background   For more information, see:    Mercury  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Catalyst:  a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without itself undergoing any permanent chemical change.   Electrode:  a conductor through which an electric current enters or leaves an object, substance, or region.
   Hiring of vehicles for the carriage of goods     Hiring of vehicles for the carriage of goods     This Directive allows the use of vehicles hired by undertakings established on the territory of another Member State. Among other requirements, such vehicles must comply with the laws of the Member State of origin and be driven by the personnel of the undertaking using them. The Directive does not affect the Member States' obligations concerning the time-limits for transposition into national law.     ACT     Directive       2006/1/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 January 2006 on the use of vehicles hired without drivers for the carriage of goods by road [Official Journal L 33 of 4.2.2006].     SUMMARY     From a macroeconomic point of view, the use of hired vehicles       *      permits an optimum allocation of resources by limiting the wasteful use of factors of production.     From a microeconomic point of view, this possibility brings an element of flexibility to the organisation of transport and thus increases the productivity of the undertakings concerned.     Each Member State must allow the use within its territory of vehicles       *      hired by undertakings established on the territory of another Member State, provided that:      the vehicle has been registered or put into circulation in compliance with the laws in the latter Member State;       the contract relates solely to the hiring of a vehicle without a driver and is not accompanied by a service contract concluded with the same undertaking covering driving or accompanying personnel;       the hired vehicle is at the sole disposal of the undertaking using it during the period of the hire contract;       the hired vehicle is driven by personnel of the undertaking using it.      The following documents providing proof of the vehicle's compliance with the requirements must be carried on board:      the contract of hire, or a certified extract from that contract giving in particular the name of the lessor, the name of the lessee, the date and duration of the contract and the identification of the vehicle;       where the driver is not the person hiring the vehicle, the driver's employment contract or a certified extract from that contract giving in particular the name of the employer, the name of the employee and the date and duration of the employment contract or a recent pay slip.      The Directive does not affect the application of the rules concerning:      the organisation of the market for the carriage of goods by road for hire or reward and own account or access to the market and to quota restrictions on road capacities;       prices and conditions for the carriage of goods by road;       the formation of hire prices;       the import of vehicles;       the conditions governing access to the activity or occupation of road-vehicle lessor.

   Action plan on animal welfare 2006-2010     Action plan on animal welfare 2006-2010     For the period 2006-2010, the EU is planning general measures aimed at ensuring animal welfare and protection. The measures will focus on improving standards, developing research and indicators, informing professionals and consumers and taking action at international level.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council of 23 January 2006 on a Community Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of animals 2006-2010 [       COM(2006) 13      - Official Journal C 49 of 28.02.2006].     SUMMARY     The action plan describes the measures the Commission intends to implement between 2006 and 2010 with the aim of developing and guaranteeing       animal welfare and protection      within the European Union (EU) and in other parts of the world. Its objective is to clarify Community legislation and make provisions for proposals in areas where it is insufficient.     The Commission would like to achieve the following       objectives      :      define more clearly EU action on animal welfare;       continue to promote high standards in this field;       provide greater coordination of resource;       support research and promote alternatives to animal testing;       ensure the coherence and coordination of all EU policies on animal welfare;      The action plan defines       five main fields of interlinked action      with the aim of achieving the stated objectives:      upgrading minimum standards       promoting research and substitute methods for animal testing;       introducing welfare indicators ;       ensuring that professionals and the general public are better informed;       supporting international initiatives for animal protection.      In terms of       minimum standards      , the action plan would reinforce the existing Community regulation in line with latest scientific knowledge, practical experience and progress in international fora.It also suggests that the minimum standards should be extended to cover species and issues currently not adequately provided for under EU legislation. Emphasis will       inter alia      be put on the respect of animal welfare by means of other policies, especially the Common Agricultural Policy (conditions for assistance, possible help in rural development policy).     The action plan recommends encouraging       research projects      that fill in the gaps and provide a sound scientific framework upon which future developments of EU policy on animal protection and welfare can be based. In addition, it proposes the creation of a European centre or laboratory, whose mission would be to collect, coordinate and exchange information on research and activities. The plan also emphasises the application of the 3Rs Declaration (replacement, reduction and refinement) defined at European level with regard to animal testing.     The action plan is hoping to introduce       standardised animal welfare indicators      . These indicators would guarantee that the minimum standards or stricter standards have been respected. The action plan also suggests that a Community label be created in order to promote products elaborated under higher animal welfare standards.     The action plan underlines the importance of       training professionals      , especially in order to disseminate good practice, and of informing consumers to enable them to make more enlightened choices on their purchases.     Under the action plan, the EU will continue to promote animal welfare standards within       international fora      such as the International Office of Epizootics (IOE) and the European Council. The plan advocates promoting the recognition and importance of these standards within the World Trade Organisation. Closer cooperation is also envisaged between the EU and countries that apply high standards and with developing countries.     The measures foreseen in the action plan will be assessed regularly in order to evaluate the progress made and to program complementary action after 2010.      Context      The action plan responds to the principles laid down in the protocol on animal welfare and protection annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (EC Treaty). This protocol recognises that animals are sentient beings and that full regard should be paid to animal welfare concerns when formulating or implementing policies relating to agriculture, transport, research and the internal market.     The impact study accompanying the action plan takes stock of the anticipated benefits of the action plan, of the existing legislation and of the research undertaken.     Since 1974, European legislation has been developed with a view to protecting animals and ensuring their well-being on farm holdings, during transport and at the time of slaughter.     RELATED ACTS      Report from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - Options for animal welfare labelling and the establishment of a European Network of Reference Centres for the protection and welfare of animals [         COM(2009) 584        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      The Commission wishes to improve information for European consumers on animal welfare matters. In order to do this, it is launching a debate on the labelling of consumer products. By enabling consumers to identify and choose animal welfare-friendly products, the Commission hopes to encourage producers to improve their practices in order to satisfy demand.     This Report should enable the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions to conduct this debate, specifically in the following areas:      consumer awareness of animal welfare;       animal welfare-friendly products;       the terms used on products;       third country producers’ access to voluntary certification systems, in compliance with the principles of the World Trade Organisation (WTO);       indicators and methods of measuring animal welfare;       coordinating centres of scientific research.

act   Regulation (EC) No  91/2003  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 on rail transport statistics [  See amending acts  ].   summary   The Commission requires statistics on freight transport and rail transport of passengers as well as rail accidents in order to ensure the monitoring and development of the common transport policy and the preparation of measures in the field of transport safety.  The scope of this regulation covers all railway undertakings in the European Union (EU). Each EU country must report statistics which relate to rail transport on its national territory. EU countries may exclude from the scope of this regulation:   railway undertakings which operate entirely or mainly within industrial and similar installations;   railway undertakings which provide local tourist services.   The statistics to be collected are set out in Annexes A to H to this regulation. The main tables setting out the annual statistics on goods and passenger transport are shown in Annexes A to D, and the quarterly statistics are shown in Annex E. Annexes F and G show the regional statistics and statistics on traffic flows on the rail network and Annex H shows statistics on accidents.  For each type of data, the corresponding annex specifies:   the list of variables and the corresponding units of measurement;   the reference periods and frequency;   the list of tables with the breakdown for each table;   the deadlines for transmission of data;   the first reference period for which data are to be transmitted;   where necessary, additional comments.   EU countries must also provide a list of the railway undertakings for which statistics are provided, as specified in Annex I. Goods must be classified in accordance with Annex J and dangerous goods must additionally be classified in accordance with Annex K. The contents of the annexes may be adapted by the Commission.  Although the national authorities (national statistical institutes) are responsible for the coordination and quality control of the statistics transmitted to Eurostat, EU countries may designate any public or private organisation to participate in collecting the data. Different sources (surveys, administrative data, etc.) may be used in any combination to obtain the required statistics. The statistics are transmitted to Eurostat by the EU countries.  The regulation provides for the dissemination of all data specified in Annexes A to H, so long as the data is already available to the EU public or approval has been explicitly given in advance for such disclosure by the undertakings concerned. Information reported under Annex I may not be disseminated.  Eurostat develops and publishes methodological recommendations (taking account of the best practices in the rail sector) to assist EU countries in maintaining the quality of statistics in this domain. The quality of the statistical data is evaluated by Eurostat.  After data have been collected over three years, the Commission has sent a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the quality and costs of the statistics, the benefits of their availability and the burden on undertakings.  The Commission will be assisted by the Statistical Programme Committee.

summary of   Regulation (EU) 2015/751 on interchange fees for card-based payment transactions   what is the aim of the regulation  This regulation  caps interchange fees  . It increases  transparency  on fees thus permitting retailers to know the level of fees paid when accepting cards. It enhances  competition  by providing consumers with more and better choices between different types of payment cards and service providers.   key points   Specifically, the regulation:    caps interchange fees  at 0.2% of the transaction value for consumer debit cards and at 0.3% for consumer credit cards;   as regards consumer credit cards, allows EU countries to define percentage caps lower than 0.3%;   as regards consumer debit card transactions, allows EU countries to impose a fee of no more than 5 eurocents per transaction interchange fee in combination with the 0.2% cap;   provides for a limited number of  exemptions  , such as business cards used only for business expenses being charged directly to the account of the company;   increases  transparency  on the level of fees paid by retailers, thus enabling them more easily to select which payment cards to accept.   The regulation is part of a  package  that includes also the  revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2)  , on which political agreement was reached in May 2015. The package aims to promote the digital single market by making payments safer and cheaper and paves the way for innovative payment technologies.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 8 June 2015.   background   For more information, see:    Card, internet and mobile payments  (  European Commission  )    Payment services  (  European Commission  ).
   Rights of victims of crime (Proposal)     Rights of victims of crime (Proposal)     The Commission proposes minimum standards for victims of crime. The Proposal for a Directive aims to ensure that the specific needs of victims are taken into account during criminal proceedings, regardless of the nature of the offence or where it took place within the European Union (EU).     PROPOSAL     Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime [       COM(2011) 275      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The Commission proposes a Directive aimed at ensuring that victims       *      of crime have the same level of protection, support and access to justice in all European Union (EU) countries. It will replace       Framework Decision 2001/220/JAI      on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings and forms part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening victims’ rights.     The Directive will accord the status of victim not only to persons harmed by the offence, but also to certain family members       *      if the person dies as a result of the offence.      Information and support for victims      To enable them to fully access their rights, victims must receive sufficient information in a comprehensible form. They must also have access to psychological support and practical assistance. The Proposal aims to guarantee:      the         right to receive information from first contact with a judicial authority        , specifically on how to make a complaint of a criminal offence, details of the proceedings and how to obtain protection if required;       the         right to receive information about their case        , in particular on the decision to end or proceed with an investigation, on the time and place of the trial, and, under certain conditions, on the release of the person prosecuted for the offence;       the         right to understand and to be understood        ;       the         right to interpretation and translation        : if victims do not speak the language of the criminal proceedings, they shall be provided with interpretation free of charge and shall receive a translation of the complaint made, of any decision ending the proceedings, and of information concerning their rights;       the         right to access victim support services        : these services must be free of charge and also accessible to certain family members. They provide emotional and psychological support, as well as practical assistance, for example concerning financial issues and the role of the victim in criminal proceedings.       Participation of victims in criminal proceedings      Victims have a legitimate interest in seeing that justice is done. Furthermore, they should be able to participate in the criminal proceedings which concern them. To this end, the Commission’s Proposal includes a number of rights which victims should be assured of:      the right         to have their complaint acknowledged        ;       the right to         be heard during the proceedings        ;       the right         to request a revision in the event of a decision not to prosecute        ;       rights to         safeguards in the event of using mediation        and other restorative justice services; the aim is to protect victims from any intimidation or further victimisation during the process. These services can only be used with victims’ consent and after they have been properly informed. Consent may be withdrawn at any time;       the right to         legal aid        and to         reimbursement of costs        where the victim participates in criminal proceedings;       the right to the         return of property        seized in the course of criminal proceedings;       the right to a         decision on compensation from the offender        in the course of criminal proceedings;       concerning         victims resident in another EU country        , the difficulties connected with these cases should be reduced, specifically by taking a statement from the victim immediately after the complaint of the criminal offence is made and by using video conferencing and telephone conference calls as much as possible for the purpose of interviewing victims. Where victims were unable to make a complaint of a criminal offence in the State where the offence took place, they should be able to do so in their Member State of residence which will then send the complaint to the Member State concerned.       Recognition of vulnerability and protection of victims      The Commission proposes that measures should be available to protect the safety of victims and their family members from possible retaliation or intimidation by the offender. The authorities will therefore ensure that contact with the latter is reduced, particularly in premises where the criminal proceedings are conducted.     During the investigation, victims will be interviewed quickly and only as many times as is necessary. If they wish, they may be accompanied by a legal representative or by a person of their choice. Their private life as well as that of their family must be protected.     The Proposal for a Directive recognises that certain people have a particularly high risk of suffering further during criminal proceedings. After an assessment of their individual needs, these       vulnerable victims      shall be accorded certain additional rights and services. This Proposal considers children, disabled people and victims of sexual violence or human trafficking to be vulnerable victims.     It is important that justice professionals, police officers and members of the victim support services receive appropriate training so that they are better able to meet the needs of victims.       Key terms of the Act         Victim: any natural person who has suffered harm, including physical or mental injury, emotional suffering or economic loss directly caused by a criminal offence; also any family members of a person whose death has been caused by a criminal offence.         Family member: the spouse, non-marital cohabitee, registered partner, the relatives in direct line, the brothers and sisters, and the dependants of the victim.        Reference           Proposal               Official Journal               Procedure                COM(2011) 275                -                2011/129/COD           RELATED ACTS      Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on mutual recognition of protection measures in civil matters [         COM(2011) 276        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      The aim of the proposed Regulation is that any protection measure issued by a Member State will be easily recognised in the rest of the EU without any further formality other than a standardised, multi-lingual certificate.

   Partnership agreements with Non-EU Member Countries     Partnership agreements with Non-EU Member Countries     This communication reviews Community policy on fisheries agreements with non-EU countries in order to contribute more effectively to the sustainable development of fisheries while protecting the interests of the European fisheries sector.     ACT     Commission communication of 23 December 2002 on an integrated framework for fisheries partnership agreements with third countries [       COM(2002) 637      final - Not published in the Official Journal]     SUMMARY      Community agreements under the common fisheries policy      . Under the CFP the European Union develops different types of relationships with third countries.     Multilateral actions have been taken by the European Union (EU) and several Member States regarding, in particular, straddling stocks and stocks developing in the high seas, such as the highly migratory species. The Community has also concluded many bilateral agreements.     To meet the new challenges offered by responsible fishing, the European Commission is proposing to transform its bilateral agreements with financial contributions into fisheries partnership agreements (FPAs) to encourage sustainable fisheries in the interests of satisfying all the parties.     These agreements generally concern the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP countries) and should expand to include all countries offering access to their surplus fish.      The Union's policy on bilateral relations based on financial contributions.      The Union wishes to implement sustainable fisheries while protecting the interests of its distant-water fishing fleet. The FPAs will meet these objectives. They will provide a vehicle for political dialogue between the EU and certain third countries covering aspects relating to the management of resources, fleet monitoring and surveillance and the development of fisheries.     The single financial contribution paid by the European Union will consist of two parts. Firstly, the contribution, which will be assessed in the light of access to resources and will for the most part be financed by the private sector in the form of fees, and secondly, the financial compensation, which will be allocated to the development of sustainable fishing.     The Community contribution will be calculated taking account of the fishing opportunities made available to Community vessels, the identification of measures to encourage the development of sustainable fisheries and, lastly, the impact of the partnership agreement and the participation of European interests on the partner coastal state's fisheries sector as a whole.      Objectives and implementation of the FPAs.      The FPAs will guarantee the sustainability of the fisheries sector and become the basis for external bilateral and sub-regional action under the common fisheries policy.     For the purposes of drawing up the FPAs, sustainability policy will be defined in collaboration with the country concerned. In particular, this will involve assessing the national fisheries policy and identifying what the country needs in order to develop sustainable fisheries policy.     The FPAs will encourage the transfer of capital, technology and know-how, in particular through the creation of joint ventures. They will also fit in with the overall development of the coastal regions and their integration into the world fisheries economy.     Last updated: 16.06.2006  
   Road safety: Road Safety Action Programme (2003-2010)     Road safety: Road Safety Action Programme (2003-2010)     Of all modes of transport, transport by road is the most dangerous and the most costly in terms of human lives. For this reason, the Road Safety Action Programme (2003-2010) proposes a series of measures such as stepping up checks on road traffic, deploying new road safety technologies, improving road infrastructure and measures to improve users' behaviour. The ultimate objective is to halve the number of people killed on the roads by 2010.     ACT     Communication from the Commission on the European Road Safety Action Programme. Halving the number of road accident victims in the European Union by 2010: a shared responsibility [       COM(2003) 311      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     1 300 000 accidents a year cause more than 40 000 deaths and 1 700 000 injuries on the roads. The direct and indirect cost has been estimated at 160 billion euros, i.e. 2% of the EU's GNP. Certain groups of the population or categories of road user are particularly vulnerable: young people aged between 15 and 24 (10 000 killed each year), pedestrians (7 000) and cyclists (1 800).     In its       White Paper      on European transport policy, the Commission therefore proposed that the European Union should set itself the target of halving the number of road deaths by 2010. All Member States are faced with the same road safety problems, namely excessive speed, drinking and driving, failure to wear a seat belt, the insufficient protection provided by vehicles, the existence of accident black spots, non-compliance with driving and rest times by commercial drivers and poor visibility. The forthcoming enlargement to include countries with a poor level of road safety is an additional challenge.     The main areas of action outlined in this communication are the following:      Encouraging road users to improve their behaviour       Objective      : to encourage road users to improve their behaviour through stricter compliance with the existing legislation, while harmonising the penalties at EU level, having continuous training for private and commercial drivers, improving police checks and promoting education and road user awareness campaigns.     The failure of drivers to comply with basic road safety legislation is the main cause of serious accidents. The Commission will give priority to education and awareness campaigns aimed at encouraging the use of crash helmets and seat belts and discouraging speeding and alcohol consumption. At the same time, the Commission will take action to amend the Directive on       driving licences      in order to set minimum requirements as regards driving ability.      Main measures      : to encourage the general use of crash helmets by cyclists and by all two-wheel motor vehicle users, continue specific work on young drivers, harmonise the penalties for international hauliers, establish the appropriate classification and labelling of medicines which affect driving ability, and develop best practice guidelines as regards police checks, etc.      Making use of technical progress       Objective      : to make vehicles safer through the harmonisation of passive safety measures (such as mandatory fitting of seat belts) and support for technical progress.     Given that car occupants account for 57% of fatal accident victims, it is necessary that technical progress in vehicle safety is maintained. In view of this, the Commission will continue to support EuroNCAP (the European New Car Assessment Programme) to ensure that new cars are tested in accordance with harmonised testing protocols and to inform and raise awareness among consumers.     The       eSafety      initiative launched in 2002 by the Commission and the motor vehicle industry aims to formulate recommendations and propose a number of actions at EU level. In parallel with this, research activities in the field of road safety must be strengthened, particularly within the context of the       Sixth Research Framework Programme      .      Main measures      : to introduce universal anchorage systems for child restraint devices, improve cars to reduce the severity of accidents involving pedestrians and cyclists, eliminate blind spots in heavy goods vehicles, facilitate the movement of persons with reduced mobility, and improve motorcycle safety, etc.      Encouraging the improvement of road infrastructure       Objective      : to improve road infrastructure by identifying and eliminating accident black spots.     Road infrastructure improvements can contribute towards reducing the frequency and seriousness of road traffic accidents. The early detection of abnormal traffic conditions and the transmission of relevant data to drivers can help to improve road safety. In the context of the development of the 'intelligent road', the entry into service in 2008 of the       Galileo      European satellite positioning system will enable navigation and guidance systems to be developed and make it possible to provide traffic information and to monitor vehicles carrying hazardous goods.     The Commission will submit a proposal for a framework Directive on road infrastructure safety with a view to introducing a system for the harmonised management of accident black spots and road safety audits for roads on the trans-European network (TEN).      Main measures      : to propose a Directive on road infrastructure safety, draw up technical guidelines concerning audit methods, urban safety management and speed-moderation techniques, draw up good practice guidelines for level-crossings, carry out research and demonstration projects on 'intelligent roads', carry out safety impact assessments of new projects, improve safety levels in       tunnels      , etc.      Safe commercial goods and passenger transport       Objective      : to reduce the number of accidents involving heavy goods vehicles and regulate the training of commercial drivers and compliance with driving and rest periods.     In view of the growth of heavy goods traffic, it is necessary to continue to improve the safety of the trans-European road network. Driving heavy goods vehicles is one of the most dangerous professions, and commercial drivers also have a right to a safe working environment in line with the standards on working conditions.      Main measures      : to tighten legislation on commercial drivers' working conditions, install digital tachographs in commercial vehicles, adapt to technical progress the Community legislation concerning the carriage of hazardous goods, make the wearing of seatbelts compulsory in coaches and heavy goods vehicles, improve protection in vehicles regularly used for the carriage of children, etc.      Emergency services and care for road accident victims       Objective      : to examine best practice with regard to post-accident medical care.     The improvement of the response to and care in the event of road accidents could save several thousand lives in the EU. The emergency number 112 allows telephone network operators to provide the emergency services with information to trace emergency calls in the event of an accident. Detailed information on injury severity is also needed for a better understanding of the potential for reducing injuries and for measuring the performance of the emergency medical services.      Main measures      : to carry out demonstration projects involving the whole chain of emergency service provision and study best practices in post-accident care.      Accident data collection, analysis and dissemination       Objective      : to improve the collection and analysis of data on accidents so as to identify the priority fields of action.     Although accidents are random events, it is necessary to understand their causes, circumstances and consequences, so that they can be managed and prevented or mitigated. Thorough independent investigations should be carried out at national level in accordance with a European methodology. The results should be communicated to a committee of independent experts who will be responsible for improving the legislation and adapting the methodology to technical developments.     One example is the       CARE      database, made up of police reports, which should be developed in the interests of achieving greater transparency. The Commission aims to set up a European road safety observatory within the Commission.      Main measures      : to develop and expand the CARE database, assess and improve systems for linking hospital data and national road accident statistics, set up a European road safety observatory, establish a European methodology for independent road accident investigations, set up a group of independent experts, etc.      A European Road Safety Charter      The Commission intends to mobilise all parties concerned: transport companies, vehicle and parts manufacturers, insurance companies, infrastructure operators, local and regional authorities by inviting them to subscribe to a European Road Safety Charter. Each signatory must give specific commitments which will be publicised, and their compliance with them will be monitored.

As a result of this Decision, short-range automotive radars capable of detecting the risk of collision and of automatically engaging the braking system should become available in the second half of 2005. A special frequency band covering the territory of the EU will now be available for short-range radars.     Other useful applications are currently being developed, such as high-capacity wireless data transmission systems and the location of victims in emergency situations.     Last updated: 27.01.2005  
   VAT anti-fraud strategy     VAT anti-fraud strategy     In order to improve the value added tax (VAT) management system and to protect Member States against VAT fraud, the Commission proposes a review, with particular regard to methods of control, registration, information and collection of revenue in the context of an increase in cross-border transactions. The Community approach and better cooperation between Member States are the essential means to provide an appropriate response.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council of 23 November 2007 concerning some key elements contributing to the establishment of the VAT anti-fraud strategy within the EU [       COM(2007) 758      final - not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The value added tax (VAT) system within the single market is not sufficient to combat VAT fraud, as in the case of carousel frauds. In order to improve the protection of VAT revenue for Member States, there is a need for greater system harmonisation and increased cooperation between Member States. In this Communication, which is a follow-up to the       2006 communication      , the Commission proposes measures to improve and strengthen the existing system.      Effective control of VAT operators      Tax administrations need to have       relevant and timely information      . An increased frequency of statements on intra-Community supplies and faster transmission of this information between tax administrations should contribute towards meeting this requirement. The question is whether this solution will be sufficient to ensure effective control of intra-Community operations or if more needs to be done.     Nevertheless, the requirement for relevant information must comply with the objective for a 25% reduction in the administrative burden for businesses stipulated as part of the       renewed Lisbon strategy      . The right balance also needs to be ensured between obligations imposed on cross-border trade and obligations imposed on domestic markets.     In addition,       reporting obligations for businesses      need to be limited (information available in their accounting systems) and simple (electronic transmission) to restrict their impact on businesses. Small and medium-sized businesses not involved in intra-Community trade should not be affected. Furthermore, a greater harmonisation of reporting obligations, and even invoicing rules, could permit a reduction in costs for businesses operating in several Member States. A minimum level of information exchanged between tax administrations could also be determined at Community level.     Tax administrations must also be able to make use of all data collected. To that end, not only does this information need to be detailed, it also needs to be available via high-performance systems capable of locating transactions and operators which require special attention.      Stronger Community approach      The increase in the number of cross-border transactions and of different taxation locations and places of business in the European Union make it more complicated to protect VAT revenue for all Member States. In this context, the Commission proposes a Community approach for the VAT system, enabling cooperation between Member States to be strengthened in three areas, namely:       Responsibility for control.        Increased cooperation, such as mutual assistance for recovery of taxes is to provide a greater guarantee to Member States with regard to the internal market. Nevertheless, costs need to be limited;        Risk management        . The rapid exchange of data between tax administrations regarding activities where risk is inherent is important in order to identify potential losses of tax revenue, particularly with regard to missing trader frauds. The experience of Member States, such as Belgium and its system of rapid exchange of targeted information and risk analysis between 24 Member States, could serve as a point of reference;        Criminal proceedings        . To ensure reciprocity of criminal proceedings between Member States, additional legislative measures are necessary. Nevertheless, the Convention on the protection of financial interests of the European Community (PFI convention) already offers an appropriate framework of criminal law protection.       Status of taxable persons identified for VAT      Tax administrations need to have reliable information relating to registrations. This objective requires a common approach as regards maintaining an up-to-date register of taxable persons identified for VAT. As regards registration, greater vigilance is of the utmost importance when issuing (including monitoring in the initial months) and checking VAT numbers. Centralised access to the register should also be improved. As regards de-registration, tax administrations should automatically check whether the VAT numbers are still used and delete those which are no longer being used from the automated VAT information exchange system (       VIES      ). Changes in national procedures should be made and minimum Community standards should be established.      Collection of VAT revenue in the event of fraud      Tax administrations need to be in a position to collect VAT revenue due in cases of confirmed fraudulent operations. Two regulatory instruments exist in order to meet this challenge, namely:       Joint and several liability        , provided for by the Community VAT rules which permit a person other than the person liable for payment to be made jointly and severally responsible for paying the tax to the state budget. Nevertheless, their application must ensure the legal security of businesses;        Mutual assistance        for the recovery of taxes, as provided by the         Recovery Directive        . The Commission is due to propose strengthening the system in 2008.       Background      The Council has initiated a process to reinforce the Community framework for the fight against tax fraud. It concerns both "conventional" measures aimed at reinforcing the existing       VAT system      and "far-reaching" measures modifying this system. In addition, at the start of 2008, following an impact assessment, the Commission is due to present legislative proposals on priority measures established by the Council. This Communication is part of the proposals for conventional measures. It sets out courses of action to be envisaged when considering future policy and defines a Community framework.     RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee of 12 December 2008 on a coordinated strategy to improve the fight against VAT fraud in the European Union         [COM(2008) 807 final        – Not published in the Official Journal].      This Communication presents a short term action plan aimed at improving the methods used in the fight against tax fraud. The action plan contains a set of legislative measures aimed at enhancing tax administration capacity to prevent or detect VAT fraud and to recover taxes.     The European Commission has decided to present these measures in the form of three packages:      a legislative proposal regarding the reduction of timeframes in order to speed up the exchange of information between Member States;       a proposal relating to the strengthening of administrative cooperation between Member States which would require changes to         Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003        ;       a proposal concerning certain anti-fraud aspects.      The Commission is to adapt the management of the VAT system to developments in information technology and to encourage exchange of best practice between Member States.     Last updated: 05.03.2009

   European Fisheries Fund     European Fisheries Fund     This Regulation establishes a new European Fisheries Fund (EFF) for the period 2007-13. The Fund provides financial assistance to help implement the 2002 reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP) and to support the restructuring that has become necessary as the sector has developed.     ACT     Council Regulation (EC) No       1198/2006      of 27 July 2006 on the European Fisheries Fund [       See amending act(s)      ].     SUMMARY     The European Fisheries Fund (EFF) shall contribute to realising the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) objectives, which specifically consist of ensuring the conservation and sustainable use of marine resources. In order to achieve this, the Fund shall provide financial support aimed at:      ensure the long-term future of fishing activities and the sustainable use of fishery resources;       reduce pressure on stocks by matching EU fleet capacity to available;       promote the sustainable development of inland fishing;       help boost economically viable enterprises in the fisheries sector and make operating structures more competitive;       foster the protection of the environment and the conservation of marine resources;       encourage sustainable development and improve the quality of life in areas with an active fishing industry;       promote equality between women and men active in the fisheries sector.       Priorities      The EFF provides for five priorities:       measures to adapt the EU fishing fleet:        financial assistance can be granted to fishermen and fishing vessel owners affected by the measures taken to combat overfishing or to protect public health to help them temporarily or permanently lay up fishing vessels and to train, re-skill and provide early retirement to fishermen. Vessels that are permanently laid up, in addition to those already due for scrapping, may be reused for other non-fishing activities or for the creation of artificial reefs. The EFF may contribute to improving working conditions, the quality of products, energy yield and catch selectivity. It may also contribute towards replacing engines, providing non-renewable compensation to fishermen affected by permanent cessation of fishing activities and for premiums for young fishermen to buy their first fishing vessel. However, financial assistance may in no circumstances lead to an increase in the catch capacity or the power of the fishing vessel's engine;        aquaculture, inland fishing, processing and marketing        :the EFF promotes the purchase and use of gear and methods that reduce the impact of aquaculture production on the environment and improve the quality of produce and conditions in terms of human and animal health. Assistance will be limited to micro, small and medium enterprises, as well as certain large enterprises with less than 750 employees or whose turnover is less than EUR 200 million. Priority is nevertheless given to micro and small enterprises;        collective action        :certain collective action could receive aid from the EFF on the condition that they contribute to the sustainable development or conservation of resources, to improving the services offered by fishing ports, to strengthening markets in fishery products and to promoting partnerships between scientists and operators in the fisheries sector;        sustainable development of fishing areas:        the EFF supports measures and initiatives aimed at diversifying and strengthening economic development in areas affected by the decline in fishing activities.        technical assistance:        the Fund may finance initiatives involving preparations, monitoring, administrative and technical support, evaluation, audit and checks needed to implement this Regulation.       Programming      One of the main objectives of the EFF is to simplify the allocation and management of funding. Member States must send the Commission a strategic plan and an operational programme in order to benefit from assistance under the European Fisheries Fund.     The national strategic plans must set out the national priorities and objectives to implement the CFP. The Commission will organise a debate with Member States by 31 December 2011 to assess the progress made in implementing the strategic plans on the basis of the conclusions of intermediary assessments.     The strategic plans form a basis for the development of operational programmes, which will implement the policies and priorities to be co-financed by the EFF. The Commission approves the operational programmes by issuing a decision, after having checked that they are in line with the objectives of the EFF. If necessary, it may require that the operational programmes be modified.     The operational programmes are subjected to three assessments. Member States are responsible for forecast and interim assessments whilst the Commission carries out the final assessment. The part of the budget reserved for technical assistance may be used to finance these assessments.      Responsibilities      The Regulation defines the responsibilities of the Member States and of the Commission concerning the EFF. In particular, Member States are tasked with informing the general public, potential beneficiaries and stakeholders of the opportunities available under the EFF to ensure that the Fund is used in a transparent manner and to underline the role of the EU.      Financial framework      The EFF has a budget of €4 304 million for the period 2007-13. Over that period the Commission proposes to allocate on average €615 million per year to the Member States who have decided to benefit from EFF aid (all the Member States except for Luxembourg).     The amounts are divided between the Member States according to the size of their fisheries sector, the number of people working in the sector, the adjustments considered necessary for the fishing industry and continuity of the measures in hand.     Except for certain expenditure incurred by the Commission that is 100 % covered by the EFF, the maximum contribution of the EFF is always calculated as a proportion of the total sum of all public expenditure. It varies according to the priority of the initiative and will be higher for the most disadvantaged regions and for the new Member States, i.e. those covered by       the new "convergence" objective under the Structural Funds      . The intensity of public aid authorised for each operation financed also varies according to the same parameters (see Annex II to the Regulation).     The Regulation sets the rules governing eligibility of expenditure (Article 55), financial management, financial corrections, budgetary appropriations and reimbursement. It establishes a Committee of the European Fisheries Fund to assist the Commission in managing the EFF.     The Union’s contribution cannot exceed the public contribution or the maximum amount of EFF assistance for each priority axis and each objective. However, derogations may be granted upon request in writing by a Member State and under certain conditions (see Article 76).      Management, monitoring and control      Each Member State must appoint the following bodies before requests for payment can be submitted:      a managing authority for the programme to select and monitor initiatives to be financed;       a certification authority to verify that expenditure complies with EU rules;       an audit authority to verify the proper functioning of the managing and certification authorities;       a monitoring committee, which a representative of the Commission participates in for advisory purposes and which assesses progress in reaching the objectives of the operational programme.      Each year the managing authorities must send the Commission an annual report, to which the Commission replies with its comments. The Commission summarises these reports in its annual report which it sends to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. The Member States must also send a final report on the implementation of the operational programme before 31 March 2017.      Context      for fisheries programming under the Financial Perspective for the EU for the 2007-13 period, replacing the       Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance      (FIFG).     Like the other European Funds, the EFF reflects the principles of the new approach for simplification, transparency, strategic planning and greater responsibility for the Member States in selecting and implementing the Funds. The EFF is one of two instruments for expenditure incurred under the CFP.

act   Regulation (EU) No  1095/2010  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority), amending Decision No 716/2009/EC and repealing Commission Decision 2009/77/EC.  Based in Paris, the  European Securities and Markets Authority  (ESMA) was created in 2010 to safeguard the stability of the European financial markets and address shortcomings in European financial supervision.   what does this regulation do  It creates the ESMA, which is a European authority that strengthens the coordination between national regulators of financial markets and ensures the consistent application of EU financial legislation in EU countries.   key points    Consistent application of law   ESMA draws up regulatory and technical standards based on EU financial legislation. It also has the power to issue guidelines and recommendations on the application of European law.   Consumer protection and financial activities   ESMA promotes transparency, simplicity and fairness in the markets to protect consumers of financial products. Among its tasks, it monitors financial activities and analyses consumer trends. Under certain strict conditions, it can temporarily prohibit or restrict financial activities that cause a threat to the stability of the markets.   Breach of law   ESMA can investigate a breach of law by a national authority. This arises when the latter fails to ensure that a financial market participant complies with European law.  Within 2 months, ESMA can issue a recommendation requiring the national authority to take the necessary action to comply with European law. Then, the European Commission may issue a formal opinion. If the national authority’s non-compliance persists, ESMA may directly address a decision to a financial market participant under certain strict conditions. This decision prevails over previous decisions taken by the national authority.   European financial supervision   ESMA is part of the European System of Financial Supervision created in 2010 and which comprises three other supervisory organisations:        —     the  European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority  based in Frankfurt;            —     the  European Banking Authority  based in London;            —     the  European Systemic Risk Board  based in Frankfurt.

   Civil aviation licences     Civil aviation licences     This directive aims to establish a Community procedure for the mutual acceptance of licences and qualifications of persons working in civil aviation in order to ensure that air transport services operate efficiently and safely and to guarantee free movement of these workers throughout the Community.     ACT     Council Directive       91/670/EEC      of 16 December 1991 on the mutual acceptance of licences for persons working in civil aviation [Official Journal L 373 of 31.12.1991].     SUMMARY     The Directive applies to procedures for the mutual acceptance of licences issued by the Member States to flight crews in civil aviation.     Description of the conditions under which Member States have to accept licences issued by other Member States, together with the associated privileges and certificates. Holders of private pilot licences may fly aircraft registered in another Member State. This recognition is limited to the exercise of the privileges of the holder of a private pilot's licence and of associated aircraft ratings under visual flight rules (VFR) by day only in an aircraft certificated for single-pilot operations.     A Member State must accept any licence issued by another Member State in accordance with the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation, provided that the holder has complied with the special validation requirements described in the annex to the Directive.     The Commission drew up and sent to all Member States a comparative survey of the requirements individuals must meet in order to qualify for licences covering the same activities issued in each Member State to enable the competent authorities to assess the extent to which licences issued by other Member States are the equivalent of their own. Description of the procedure to be followed by a Member State when a licence cannot be accepted because it is not equivalent.     The Directive provides that nationals of all Member States are to be admitted to public and private training institutions and to examinations in any Member State on the same basis as its own nationals.     Member States may choose whether to accept licences issued by Member States on the basis of licences issued by third countries.     As from 7 April 2008, Directive       91/670/EEC      will be repealed by Regulation (EC) No       216/2008      which establishes a framework for the definition and implementation of technical rules and common admistrative procedures in the field of civil aviation, and sets up a European Aviation Safety Agency (       EASA      ). In particular, this Regulation defines the different qualifications required for the allocation of licences for pilots and cabin crew, conditions for their issue, and the privileges and responsibilities of holders of licences.      References      RELATED ACTS      Opinion 93/245/EEC, Official Journal L 111, 05.05.1993      Commission Opinion of 26 April 1993 concerning the application of article 4(2) of Directive       91/670/EEC      on mutual acceptance of personnel licences for the exercise of functions in civil aviation - equivalence of French, Irish and Portuguese pilot licences.     The Opinion was issued following a request by the French authorities regarding equivalence between pilot licences issued by Ireland and Portugal and those issued by France. The Commission considers that an Irish or Portuguese air transport pilot licence may be considered as equivalent to a comparable French licence if it includes a pilot-in-command rating for multi-engined aircraft of more than 5 700 kg (FAR/JAR category 25) or any other aircraft considered as equivalent by the French authorities.      Opinion 93/456/EEC      -       Official Journal L 213, 24.08.1993      Commission Opinion of 23 July 1993 concerning the application of Article 4(2) of Directive       91/670/EEC      on mutual acceptance of personnel licences for the exercise of function in civil aviation - equivalence of United Kingdom, French and Belgian pilot licences.

act   Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee: A vision for the internal market for industrial products (  COM(2014) 25 final  of 22 January 2014 - not published in the Official Journal).   summary   EU legislation on industrial products sets out the essential requirements relating to safety, health and other public interests that businesses must comply with when putting products on the EU market, including the affixing of the CE marking. This legislation also sets out the compulsory steps to be taken to demonstrate that the product complies with EU law before it can carry the CE marking.  The overall conclusion of an online public consultation and assessment in this area is that the EU’s internal market legislation for products is relevant to meeting EU objectives relating to the need for technical harmonisation measures with high levels of protection of health and safety and consumers, and to the environment. Therefore, it is not only a key factor for the competitiveness of European industry but also for consumer and environmental protection.  Certain points for improvement were also identified in the policy paper known as a communication. Whilst the Commission seeks to keep up with the pace of technological challenges in the 21st century, it also wishes to take account of European industry’s demand for periods of regulatory stability without any major overhaul of the rules.  The policy paper identified the following priorities.   Strong enforcement mechanisms   This means stepping up the Commission’s efforts to ensure that EU law is respected to safeguard important public interests such as health and safety; the protection of the environment and security; and the protection of consumers. The Commission is looking into the possibility of drafting a legislative proposal on how to streamline and harmonise economic sanctions of an administrative or civil nature where EU law is not respected.   Cross-sector legislation on products   The Commission will assess the need to adopt horizontal (i.e cross-sector) legislation setting out common elements across sectors.   Innovation and the digital future   The Commission will take into account innovation and technological developments when it is developing new legislative proposals relating to industrial products. It will also launch an initiative on e-compliance whereby companies can demonstrate their compliance with EU legislation electronically.   The blurring distinction between products and their connected services   Manufacturing firms are increasingly offering services (e.g. maintenance and training) along with their traditional products. The Commission will examine how to improve the way in which this blurring distinction between products and services is handled.   More regulations, fewer directives   Subject to a case-by-case assessment, the Commission will give priority to regulations as a source of EU law rather than directives because, being directly applicable in EU countries, they lead to more certainty for business.   A business-friendly approach to product rules   Currently, businesses are faced with many laws applying to the same products/manufacturers and the boundaries between many of the laws are sometimes unclear. When carrying out a periodic review of sectoral legislation, the Commission will consider whether EU law on industrial products can be brought together with other legislation applicable to the same category of products.   The global market   The EU should continue to promote international convergence of legislation and technical standards for industrial products while ensuring a high level of protection of public interests. The Commission should ensure more focus on the impact of EU regulation on the international competitiveness of EU businesses.
   The euro and the international economy     The euro and the international economy     In this working document, the European Commission presents a first analysis of the likely impact of the euro on developments in the international economy and, more specifically, on the international monetary system.     ACT     Commission working document of 23 April 1997 on the external aspects of Economic and Monetary Union [SEC (97) 699 final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Given the economic importance of the euro area, the introduction of the single currency will have significant effects, not only on the Member States which will not be participating but also on countries outside the European Union. This external aspect of the euro is the subject of increasing discussion in international forums such as the Organisation for Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).     Supposing that all the Member States participate in the euro area, the economic and monetary union (EMU) will have the following characteristics:      Its economic and commercial weight will be comparable to that of the United States and larger than that of Japan;       If intra-Community trade is excluded, the degree of openness of the euro area is 10.2%, i.e. equivalent to that of the United States and Japan;       Greater synchronisation of the economic cycles in the different Member States due to better         coordination of economic policies        will make economic developments in the euro area more important to the rest of the world;       As a result of the disappearance of tensions between European currencies (which used potentially to stem from shocks occurring outside the European Union), the economic performance of the euro area will be less sensitive to exchange-rate fluctuations.      With the completion of EMU, the European financial market will become truly integrated:      the development of an efficient trans-border payment system (TARGET) connecting financial centres;       the harmonisation of financial instruments and convergence towards the most efficient means of financing;       a unified money market implying more intense competition between banks and financial intermediaries;       the elimination of the exchange-rate risk between participating countries.      Despite this integration, financial markets can be expected to retain some national characteristics.     The size of EMU, the stability of the currency and the wide financial market underpinning it should promote international use of the euro.     As an invoicing currency for trade, the euro should be widely used in trade relations involving the European Union directly but also, to a certain extent, in commercial transactions not involving the Member States of the Union.     As a result of the independence of the       European Central Bank      (ECB) and its stability-oriented policies, the euro should constitute an important reserve currency and play a key role in portfolios of financial assets on an international scale. If these same factors were to make the euro more attractive in the eyes of private investors, it would be more difficult to predict how important the euro would be in the composition of private portfolios.     The transformation of the euro into an important international currency will take place gradually; it should first show itself in the countries which have close economic links with the European Union.     The internationalisation of the euro will mean that ECB action has international repercussions. However, it will initially complicate the conduct of monetary policy as a result of the influence on monetary aggregates of decisions by external agents.     The changeover to the euro brings with it the potential risk of a period of exchange-rate instability between the euro and other major currencies due to a number of factors:      The perception of the future direction of the ECB´s monetary policy: the bank´s place at the centre of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), its regulatory independance and its statutory objective of maintaining price stability should however immediately establish its credibility;       A possible excess stock of dollars in central banks: since the latter are fully aware of the potential impact of their transactions on exchange markets, it can be expected that operations to reduce excessive dollar holdings, if any, will be carried out gradually and in close cooperation;       Reallocations of private portfolios following the introduction of the euro are a complex matter: however, opposing effects should combine to balance out the net effects.      In the long term, exchange rates are determined mainly by economic fundamentals (growth, inflation, productivity, budget balances, current balances, etc.), which are in turn influenced by the economic policies of the Union and also those of its partners.     The economic policy framework laid down in the Treaty should allow for easy monetary conditions while maintaining an appropriate exchange rate. European economic policies will therefore constitute a valuable point of reference in international economic affairs.     The completion of EMU is likely to lead to important developments in the international monetary system, principally by making it more symmetrical: the potential gains from macroeconomic coordination will tend to be more uniformly distributed among the partners.     Finally, EMU will also have implications for how international institutions such as the IMF operate matters concerning the representation of the Union within these organisations will have to be discussed and the compatibility of current practice with the provisions of the Treaty will have to be verified.

   Framework for promoting employee financial participation     Framework for promoting employee financial participation     This communication is intended to define a Community framework for promoting employee financial participation in profits and enterprise results. It sets out the general principles of financial participation, existing transnational obstacles and measures to be taken to introduce financial participation more widely.     ACT     Commission Communication of 5 July 2002, framework for the promotion of employee financial participation [       COM(2002) 364      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     At the Lisbon Summit, the Union set itself the goal of "becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion". Employee participation can make a significant contribution to realising this aim. If it is handled properly, it can not only increase companies' productivity, competitiveness and profitability but also encourage employee participation, increase the quality of employment and contribute to greater social cohesion.     The positive results that financial participation schemes for employees have produced in many countries certainly have some bearing on the fact that this question has become a Union-wide political priority. Moreover, an increasing number of enterprises have started to become aware of the possibilities offered by such schemes, i.e. motivating employees and aligning their interests with those of the shareholders, and also recruiting and keeping staff. Employee participation in profits and enterprise results therefore goes hand in hand with a certain number of advantages for enterprises, employees and the economy as a whole.      Forms of financial participation      Financial participation of employees in the profits and results of the enterprise may take many different forms. The common element - and their main characteristic - lies in the fact that they are intended to give employees, usually all employees, access to the enterprise's profits and/or results.     The PEPPER reports (PEPPER I and PEPPER II) on promoting employee participation in profits and enterprise results and Council Recommendation 92/443/EEC divided the types of financial participation schemes into two main categories:      participation in profits, i.e., sharing of profits between those providing the capital and those providing the labour by giving employees a variable income, in addition to their fixed pay, linked with the profits or another measure of the enterprise's results.       employee shareholding, which offers employees indirect participation in the enterprise's results in the form of dividends and/or appreciation of the value of the capital they hold.      This communication deals with the following main aspects of employee financial participation:      the general principles;       transnational obstacles;       promotion of more widespread financial participation.       General principles      A review of the various forms of financial participation has shown how different the schemes are. Nevertheless, there are some essential elements and principles which characterise the majority of the schemes and the Member States' policies.     The general principles defined in this communication may serve as a benchmark for identifying good practice;      voluntary participation: schemes for financial participation must be set up to respond to the real needs and interests of all the parties concerned and should not therefore be imposed;       the advantages of financial participation should be extended to all employees: some of the main advantages of financial participation are that employees identify more with the enterprise and it creates a sense of belonging and increases their motivation;       clarity and transparency: the financial participation schemes must enable employees to fully weigh up the risks and potential advantages of the scheme;       predefined formula: the rules on financial participation in companies must be based on a predefined formula and clearly linked to the enterprise's results. This is vital to guarantee the transparency of such schemes;       regularity: these financial participation schemes must be applied regularly (this is important as the schemes are intended to reinforce and reward sustained loyalty on the part of employees);       any unreasonable risk for employees should be avoided: compared with other "investors", employees generally bear the brunt of any economic problems their company runs into. This being so, it is important to take care to prevent any risks in setting up and managing the financial participation scheme;       a distinction should be made between pay and income from financial participation schemes;       compatibility with employee mobility: financial participation schemes must be set up so as to be compatible with employee mobility, both at international level and between companies.       Transnational obstacles      Differences in tax systems, social security contributions and the general legal framework or even cultural differences frequently make it impossible for enterprises to devise and apply a joint financial participation scheme in various places in Europe.     The main transnational obstacles are as follows:      differences in tax systems, which can raise problems on two fronts: double taxation or no taxation and substantial administrative costs for enterprises wishing to set up financial participation schemes in various countries;       the level of social security contributions, which can vary from one country to another and sometime discourages enterprises from extending financial participation schemes to certain countries;       national differences in law which can delay the introduction of financial participation at transnational level;       cultural differences and diverging views on financial participation, different national traditions or differences in social relations;       a lack of mutual recognition of financial participation schemes;       lack of information on financial participation schemes and policies in favour of existing financial participation.       How to promote financial participation      In order to increase employee financial participation in profits and enterprise results in Europe, the Member States have to pursue and intensify their efforts to set up a favourable legal and fiscal environment. Furthermore, as the extent to which financial participation has become established varies from one country to another, there is considerable scope for stepping up the exchange of information and experience.     The Commission will promote the exchange of information and good practice by activities such as making comparative assessments of national policies and practices, including financial participation in the peer review programme under the Employment Guidelines or organising national conferences.      Reinforcing social dialogue      All the evidence suggests that the advantages of financial participation are greater when the schemes are introduced in a partnership with employees and when they are part of an overall approach to participatory management.     The Commission attaches particular importance to supporting the social partners' initiatives on financial participation, including exchanges of information and experience, formation of networks and research and studies.      Financial participation and small and medium-sized enterprises (SME)      The advantages of employee financial participation are not confined to large enterprises with profitability concerns. SMEs can also benefit from these advantages. The Commission attaches particular importance to the specific situation of SMEs and encourages research into their specific problems.      Improving information by research and studies      The Commission continues to support and carry out research projects to provide supply any information which is missing. It focuses particularly on collecting data on how and where participation schemes are implemented, the impact of financial participation on company performance, quality of work, social cohesion and the situation of financial participation in acceding countries. It also asks the European Foundation for Improving Living and Working Conditions to pursue its activities in the field of employee financial participation.      Establishing networks      In order to step up dissemination of information and experience and to make the possibilities of financial participation more widely known, it is important to promote a permanent dialogue at European level. The Commission supports the establishment of the following networks: university networks and networks of experts, social partners, enterprises and institutes.      Financial support for financial participation initiatives      Financial support is available via various channels: the "Industrial relations and social dialogue" budget heading and Community incentive measures in the field of employment. Under Article 6 of the Regulation on the European Social Fund, the Commission may finance innovative action designed to promote new approaches and identify examples of good practice.     The activities set out in this Communication initially cover the period 2002-2004. Following this, the progress achieved in meeting the defined objectives will be assessed in a process that will closely involve all the parties concerned. A decision will be taken on future initiatives on the basis of this assessment.

   LeaderSHIP 2015     LeaderSHIP 2015     The shipbuilding sector has specific needs which require an appropriate political response. In order to stimulate its competitiveness, the Commission set up the LeaderSHIP 2015 High Level Group to draft recommendations for the sector. In this notice, it presents these recommendations and formulates them in acts.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 21 November 2003: LeaderSHIP 2015 - Defining the future of the European Shipbuilding and Repair Industry - Competitiveness through Excellence [       COM(2003) 717      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     In January 2003, the Commission set up the LeaderSHIP 2015 Advisory Group. This group was made responsible for drafting recommendations to improve the competitiveness of the shipbuilding and repair sector. In this notice, the Commission presents the recommendations, divided into eight fields of crucial importance for the competitiveness of the sector.      A level playing field for shipbuilding worldwide      European shipbuilding essentially suffers from unfair competition from certain countries. This takes the form of prices set below cost levels and injurious subsidisation. The Commission therefore approves the following three recommendations made by the LeaderSHIP 2015 Group:      continuation of the EU's         current commercial policy        ;       implementation of the rules of the World Trade Organisation (         WTO        ) applicable to shipbuilding;       negotiation within the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (         OECD        ) of an agreement on shipbuilding and the application of the existing rules.       Research, development and innovation      In order for the shipbuilding sector to receive sufficient support from the Member States for its research activities, the Commission has adapted the       rules governing innovation aid for the shipbuilding sector      .      Financing      The shipbuilding sector needs substantial financing for both the construction phase (pre-delivery) and the operational phase (post-delivery) of the vessel. However, many banks are losing interest in shipbuilding. The Commission therefore proposes that the       European Investment Bank      support pre- and post-delivery financing.     In view of the risks linked to markets in foreign currencies, the Commission suggests organising an exchange-rate risk insurance system at European level.      Safety and environment      In the fields of maritime safety and protection of the marine environment, the Commission supports all the recommendations made by the LeaderSHIP 2015 Group:      the strict application of European legislation and its promotion on an international scale;       more transparent, uniform, efficient and independent inspections;       the establishment of a programme to assess the quality of shipyards throughout the world, also covering the construction of new ships and repairs;       improvements in ship repairs;       the creation of an expert committee to assist the Commission and the         European Maritime Safety Agency        ;       exploitation of the potential of         short-distance maritime transport        .       European approach to shipbuilding needs      The naval defence industry does not have the same needs as the commercial naval sector. The Commission is in favour of creating a       common market for defence equipment      . It also approves the following proposals:      the strengthening of cooperation between shipyards, particularly between different Member States. The creation of highly integrated European stakeholders will encourage European competitiveness;       the harmonisation of export rules by the Member States. Such harmonisation would make it possible to avoid distortions of competition and increase industrial cooperation.       Intellectual property rights (IPRs)      In order to protect the shipbuilding industry from pirating and the violation of intellectual property rights, the Commission supports the following initiatives:      maximum use of existing IPR instruments (copyrights, registered designs and models, trademarks, patents, specific non-disclosure and cooperation agreements);       the creation of databases containing information on the state of the art, existing patents, the competitive situation for certain products and the main right holders;       the examination, and even reinforcement, of international patent rules.       Education and training      In order to keep a skilled workforce and attract young people, the following measures are recommended:      the development of management training programmes specific to the shipbuilding sector. New management skills will be needed in order to adapt to the new structure of the industry, which comprises a few large businesses and many subcontractors;       increased         sectoral social dialogue        should make it possible to meet new qualification needs. The Commission has in fact established a         social dialogue committee        for the sector;       the exchange of staff and know-how, university workshops;       the launch of an advertising campaign to improve the image of the sector;       the creation of regional centres of excellence to support the implementation of these recommendations. Businesses and educational establishments could participate in these centres of excellence, thus facilitating student exchanges, transfers of knowledge, the dissemination of good practices and the recognition of qualifications throughout the EU.       Building a stable industrial structure      The sector has specific needs which require an appropriate response. The Member States must acknowledge the important strategic dimension of shipbuilding and ship repair in Europe. They need to develop a political approach to the sector in order to prevent its extinction in the near future. Furthermore, for security reasons, it is important to preserve some shipbuilding capacity for both maritime transport and defence.     Lastly, greater cooperation between naval defence and shipbuilding resources in Europe can also help to improve the competitiveness of the sector.     RELATED ACTS      Commission working document of 25 April 2007 - LeaderSHIP 2015 Progress Report [         COM(2007) 220        - Not published in the Official Journal].      The LeaderSHIP 2015 strategy is achieving results. The sector is no longer perceived as a subsidised industry on the decline, but is now seen as a modern, efficient industry which creates growth and jobs. The Commission intends to continue with the initiative, accelerating it in a number of fields.     Last updated: 07.02.2008  
   Interinstitutional Agreement on cooperation in budgetary matters     Interinstitutional Agreement on cooperation in budgetary matters     The Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management, concluded between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on 17 May 2006, contains the financial framework for 2007-13 and aims to implement budgetary discipline. Its purpose is also to improve the functioning of the annual budgetary procedure and cooperation between the institutions in budgetary matters.     ACT      Interinstitutional Agreement      between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     The Agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management (IIA) was concluded between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. It concerns the drafting and implemention of the European Union (EU) budget. Through this agreement, the European institutions have decided to organise their cooperation in order to improve the functioning of the budgetary procedure and to ensure the sound financial management of European finances.     The IIA comprises three sections:      Part I establishes the financial framework for the 2007-2013 period, specifically the amounts of expenditure for each policy area;       Part II organises the cooperation between the Parliament, the Council and the Commission during the budgetary procedure;       Part III establishes the rules aimed at ensuring sound financial management of EU funds.       Financial framework 2007-2013      The financial framework is intended to ensure that EU expenditure develops in an orderly manner for a given period. For each of the years from 2007 to 2013, the financial framework sets       ceilings      for each category of expenditure. The European institutions undertake to use their budgetary powers in such a way as to comply with these ceilings.     The financial framework table for the 2007-2013 period is provided in Annex I to the IIA. The ceilings are set within the limits of the EU’s       own resources      .     Furthermore, the financial framework may be subject to       technical adjustments      by the Commission. For example, these adjustments consist of revaluations of the ceilings depending on price development and the conditions of implementation of the budget.     The financial framework may also be subject to       revision      in response to any initially unforeseen circumstances, with due regard to the own resources ceiling. Any Commission proposal for such revision should be presented and adopted before the start of the budget procedure of the financial year (or the first of the series of financial years) concerned.     Furthermore, the IIA lays down rules for mobilising certain instruments outside of the financial framework:       Emergency aid reserve:        this reserve is designed to respond to the specific aid requirements of third countries following events which could not be foreseen when the budget was established. The annual amount of the reserve is fixed at EUR 221 million for the duration of the financial framework;        Solidarity Fund:        the EU         Solidarity Fund        is intended to allow swift financial assistance in the event of major disasters occurring on the territory of a Member State or of a candidate country. There will be a ceiling on the annual amount available for the Solidarity Fund of EUR 1 billion;        Flexibility instrument:        the flexibility instrument with an annual ceiling of EUR 200 million is intended to allow financing of expenditure which could not be financed within the limits of the ceilings available for one or more other headings;        European Globalisation Adjustment Fund:        the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is intended to provide additional support for workers suffering from the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns, to assist them with their reintegration into the labour market. The maximum annual amount allocated to the Fund is EUR 500 million.       Interinstitutional cooperation during the budgetary procedure      The Interinstitutional Agreement lays down the procedures and details for interinstitutional cooperation in budgetary matters as regards:      establishing the budget;       classifying expenditure;       the maximum rate of increase for non-compulsory expenditure in the absence of a financial framework;       incorporating financial provisions into legislative acts;       expenditure related to fisheries agreements;       financing the common foreign and security policy (CFSP).       Sound financial management      The institutions shall ensure that this Agreement and the budget are implemented in a context of sound financial management based on the principles of economy, efficiency, protection of financial interests, proportionality of administrative costs, and user-friendly procedures.     Furthermore, the Commission will submit twice a year a financial programme structured by heading, policy area and budget line. This financial programme shall be closely connected to the Commission’s legislative programme.     Furthermore, the Parliament, the Council and the Commission commit to strengthening internal control without adding to the administrative burden. The Institutions plan to include provisions to this end in the legislative acts concerned.     Finally, the Institutions also commit to encouraging the introduction of co-financing mechanisms based on public and private investment. The aim is to take advantage of the leverage effect of the EU budget.      Context      The Lisbon Treaty, which entered into force on 1 December 2009, introduced new provisions relating to the EU budget.     Article 312 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU specifies that the multi-annual financial framework shall henceforth be the subject of a Council Regulation, adopted unanimously and following approval by the Parliament.     Furthermore, the procedure for adopting the budget has also been revised. The role of the Parliament in particular has been strengthened and the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure has been removed.     The changes introduced by the Lisbon Treaty therefore require the current interinstitutional agreement to be revised. Two legislative proposals are currently being adopted at European level:       Proposal        for a Council Regulation laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2007-2013;       a         draft        interinstitutional agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on cooperation in budgetary matters.

   Keep Europe moving - Sustainable mobility for our continent. Mid-term review of the 2001 White Paper     Keep Europe moving - Sustainable mobility for our continent. Mid-term review of the 2001 White Paper     This Communication draws up a mid-term review of European transport strategy, set out in the 2001 White Paper. The Commission reaffirms the main principles that guide its policy. It draws attention to the changes in the context since 2001 and the need to find new solutions to problems encountered within this new framework. Enlargement, the acceleration of globalisation, international commitments on global warming, the geopolitical context of the growth in oil prices and security fears have influenced the sector and resulted in calls for new solutions     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 22 June 2006 on the mid-term review of the Transport White Paper, "Keep Europe moving - Sustainable mobility for our continent, published in 2001. Mid-term review of the Transport White Paper, published in 2001 by the European Commission" [       COM(2006) 314      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The 2001       White Paper      proposed almost 60 measures designed to implement a transport system capable of restoring the balance between different modes, revitalising the railways, promoting sea and waterway transport and controlling the increase in air transport. The White Paper was providing a response to the sustainable development strategy adopted by the Göteborg European Council in June 2001.     This communication reaffirms the principles of 2001, which guide European transport policy by responding to the economic, social and environmental needs of society. This sector provides 7% of GDP in the EU and 5% of jobs. The mobility of goods and citizens, apart from being a right, also creates cohesion and is an essential element of the competitiveness of European industry and services.      Transport policy objectives      This communication provides an opportunity for an overview of the different sectors, in order to identify new solutions in a changing context.     Transport policy is at the heart of the Lisbon agenda for growth and jobs. The policy therefore has long term objectives which seek to balance economic growth, social welfare and environmental protection in all policy choices. It is therefore necessary to:       divorce mobility from its side effects        , which are congestion, accidents and pollution;        optimise the potential        of each mode of transport. Some modes, including waterborne transport, do not reach their full capacity;        promote green propulsion and encourage the use of more environmentally friendly        , energy efficient and safer transport;        promote co-modality        , i.e. the efficient use of different modes of transport on their own and in combinations, resulting in an optimal use of resources.      The Commission also wishes to adapt rail and waterborne transport in line with the principles of the internal market. Efficiency gains supported by EU policies should therefore make these modes of transport more competitive, particularly with regard to road transport.     In order to succeed in meeting these objectives, this communication identifies       four pillars      for transport policy, namely:      the mobility of people and businesses throughout the Union;       environmental protection, the security of energy supply, promoting minimum labour standards and protecting passengers and citizens;       innovation, which supports the implementation of the two previous objectives by making sector activity more efficient and sustainable;       action on the world stage so that other countries can share in these objectives.       The changing context      The text does, however, emphasise that the political context of transport in the EU has changed:       enlargement has given the EU a continental dimension        . Europe is more diverse and each Member State finds itself in different and sometimes even contrasting situations, which include congestion in the West and accessibility problems in the East. This diversity requires differentiated solutions;        the transport industry has changed        . Consolidation is taking place at the European level, especially in the aviation and maritime sectors. In addition, globalisation has led to the creation of large logistics companies with worldwide operations. European transport policy must take this new situation into account;        transport is fast becoming a high-technology industry        . Research and innovation have a fundamental role to play. Some of the most pressing and promising areas include: intelligent transport systems involving communication, navigation and automation, engine technology with increased fuel efficiency and the promotion of alternative fuels;        international environmental commitments        , including those under the Kyoto Protocol, must be integrated into transport policy;        transport policy must continue to attain the objectives of the European energy policy        : transport accounts for 30% of total energy consumption in the EU, with oil dependency reaching 98%. High oil prices influence the sector and promote improved energy efficiency;        the international context has changed        . The threat of terrorism has impacted on the transport sector. At the same time, economic globalisation has affected trade flows and increased demand, particularly in emerging economies;        European governance is evolving        . The basic legal framework of the internal market has largely been established, and much now rests on its effective implementation in the field. The Commission is also seeking to simplify the rules.       A new challenge      Therefore, while the most pressing challenges identified in 2001 were the imbalance between different modes of transport and congestion, the situation has developed subsequently. Road congestion has escalated and is now costing the EU 1% of GDP. There has also been a sustained increase in air traffic and its impact on the environment. Greenhouse gases and global warming are now prominent issues. Overall, domestic transport accounts for 21% of greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions have risen by around 23% since 1990, threatening the achievement of Kyoto targets.     The measures envisaged by the Commission in 2001 will therefore be inadequate for achieving the objectives established at the outset, hence the need for a broader, more flexible instrument for action. In order to devise and evaluate future policies, the Commission wants to promote a debate on transport scenarios with a 20 to 40-year timescale, in order to develop a universal approach to sustainable transport.     FIRST PILLAR: MOBILITY      Road transport      Although international road transport has been liberalised, at national level it is still largely protected. The Commission wishes to establish common rules relating to professional qualifications and working conditions, which vary greatly by Member State. Moreover, the impact on competition regarding differences in fuel-tax levels between Member States are important factors that will influence future development. Therefore, the Commission wishes to narrow the excessive differences in fuel-tax levels.      Rail transport      After the liberalisation of freight transport, whose legal framework is due for completion in 2007, the third package has to open up international passenger transport. The Commission wishes to:      propose measures on access to the market and the profession;       address the issue of excessive differences in excise duty levels;       implement the acquis with the support of regulatory bodies in Member States;       step up efforts to remove technical and operational barriers to international traffic;       establish a network dedicated to rail freight within the political framework of         transport logistics        ;       organise rail-market monitoring using a scoreboard mechanism.       Air transport      The restructuring and integration of the air industry's internal market are at a very advanced stage and customers benefit from the internal market's development. The Commission nonetheless wishes to:      enlarge the internal market and extend its positive contributions to external aviation relations;       complete the creation of the single European sky in order to increase the efficiency of EU air transport;       invest to increase airport capacity, whilst clarifying regulations relating to charges;       reduce environmental effects caused by the rapid rise in traffic.       Maritime transport      The Commission identifies the maritime sector as an alternative to overland transport, particularly because it has considerable potential over short distances, as illustrated by the concept of "       motorways of the sea      ". The development of maritime transport should, however, face up to two key challenges:       the creation of an internal shipping space        . Due to international regulations, sea journeys from one Member State to another are considered as external. Therefore, the Commission wishes to organise a consultation to draw up a strategy for the creation of a "common European maritime space";        the expansion of port capacity        . In order to deal with the estimated growth in maritime transport, investment in ports should increased, in order to improve and extend services, with the help of competition and the introduction of clear rules for public sector contributions.       Transport by waterway      The Commission emphasises river transport's potential, which could be enhanced through its integration into co-modal logistics chains. The       NAIADES      programme sets out an action plan that promotes the sector, which the Commission wishes to implement.     SECOND PILLAR: PROTECTION      Employment and working conditions      Transport is a major employer, providing more than 10 million jobs in the Union. However, in some sectors, such as rail and road transport, shortages of qualified personnel have come to light. The Commission therefore wishes to focus on training and encouraging more young people to choose jobs in the transport profession.     The Commission proposes to examine rules on working conditions due to significant variations in labour costs. The Commission also wishes to establish talks with a view to applying the International Labour Organization Convention in the maritime sector.     The Commission divides the concept of protection into the following categories:       passenger rights        : The Commission notes that passenger rights have been consolidated in recent years, but considers that national authorities have to improve their follow-up of complaints. It therefore hopes to examine ways of promoting an improved quality of service and the assurance of basic passenger rights in all modes of transport, particularly for passengers with reduced mobility;        safety        : the Commission also emphasises the progress that has been made in this area, especially with the creation of a blacklist of dangerous airlines. The Commission wishes to finalise safety rules with the third maritime legislative package as well as road rules with the CARS 21 initiative and         eSafety        forum;        security        : the Commission wishes to refine the acquis of measures established in the wake of 11 September 2001 attacks, which revealed that transport is both a target and an instrument of terrorism. It will, therefore, propose amendments and broaden the scope of safety rules to include land and intermodal transport as well as critical infrastructures;        urban transport        is confronted with a specific problem; city dwellers suffer the consequences of their own mobility more than anyone else. The Commission announces the publication of a Green Paper on this issue.      THIRD PILLAR: INNOVATION     The Commission wishes to assimilate innovation across the board in transport policy in order to hasten the development of relevant solutions. Intelligent safety features, new means of communication and traffic management could all aid the mobility and integration of European networks. EU companies could also win new markets owing to their excellence in the field of transport technologies.      Energy      The transport sector uses a great deal of energy, accounting for 71% of EU oil consumption: 60% by road transport and approximately 9% by air transport. The remaining 2% is used by rail and inland navigation. Rail transport uses 75% electricity and 25% fossil fuels. The text recommends the promotion of improved energy efficiency on a European scale as well as supporting research, demonstration and market introduction of promising new technology.      Infrastructure      Some areas in the "mid-West" of the EU are affected by congestion and pollution. By 2020, 60 big airports are expected to be over congested and a similar trend is observed in ports. It will therefore be necessary to build new infrastructures or to improve existing ones. The implementation of co-modal logistics chains is another solution.      Mobilising sources of financing      The total cost of the 30 priority trans-European transport network (TEN-T) projects, recorded in 2004, is estimated at around 250 billion. However, the public financing capacities of the Member States remain constrained. Similarly, the financial perspective for the period 2007-13 provide only a limited increase in the budget available for the TENs. The EU should therefore focus its co-financing on the critical border-crossing sections and the main bottlenecks. New types of financial engineering should also be developed.      Intelligent mobility      It is becoming increasingly common to charge for the use of transport infrastructure, as demonstrated in London or on specific motorways. The EU has adopted a Directive establishing a framework for toll motorways. These tariff systems aim to finance infrastructure, whilst helping to optimise traffic. The Commission has to propose, no later than 2008, a universal, transparent and comprehensible model for the assessment of all external costs, which must serve as the basis for calculations of infrastructure charges. The Commission also calls for a process of reflection, which encompasses the other modes of transport, in order to identify how intelligent charging can help improve the functioning of the sector.     Logistics is another issue that the Commission wishes to focus on, by drawing up a strategic framework, followed by a consultation leading to an action plan.     Furthermore, the Commission states that all modes of transport must have sophisticated means of communication, navigation and automation, relying in particular on the       Galileo      system. In this respect, the       Intelligent Car      and       SESAR      programmes are used for air transport, ERTMS for the rail industry and       RIS      for waterborne transport. In addition, the Commission wishes to develop similar initiatives in the maritime sector (e-maritime programme).     FOURTH PILLAR: RELATIONS WITH THIRD COUNTRIES     The Commission would like its policy to be part of a broader relationship with non-member countries, as the transport sector is inherently connected to international issues. Furthermore, the convergence of EU and international standards opens export markets for European technology. EU transport companies are often hampered by the maintenance of import or investment barriers in non-member countries. The Commission therefore envisages developing cooperation policies and industrial dialogue with its main trading partners and regional groupings, in particular by concluding agreements. It also wishes to draw up a strategic framework for extending the main axes of the internal transport market and creating a network with neighbouring countries that so desire.

summary of   Regulation (EU) 2016/1624 on the European Border and Coast Guard   what is the aim of the regulation   It sets up a European Border and Coast Guard to ensure, for the first time, the effective implementation of integrated border management at the external borders of the European Union (  EU  ) as well as of the Schengen associate countries (Iceland, Norway and Switzerland).   This European Border and Coast Guard consists of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (‘the Agency’), created on the basis of the existing EU borders agency (commonly known as  Frontex  ), and the EU countries’ and Schengen associate countries’ authorities responsible for border management.   It also extends and strengthens Frontex’s mandate.   key points    Main tasks of the European Border and Coast Guard    The main task of the European Border and Coast Guard is to work towards a  European integrated border management  as a shared responsibility of the Agency and the national authorities responsible for border management.   The main actions of the Agency are to:   contribute to the  effective functioning of border control  at the relevant external borders, including actions to facilitate legal border crossings and the detection of cross-border crime, such as migrant smuggling or human trafficking;   provide technical and operational assistance to the participating countries through  joint operations   *  and  rapid border interventions  ;   provide technical and operational assistance in the support of  search and rescue operations for persons in distress at sea  , which may arise during border surveillance operations at sea;   provide an analysis of the risks for  internal security  as well as of the threats that may affect the functioning or  security of the EU’s external borders  ;    cooperate with non-EU countries and non Schengen associate countries  , focusing on neighbouring countries and countries of origin and/or transit for irregular immigration;   carry out a vulnerability assessment including the assessment of the capacity and readiness of the participating countries to face threats and challenges at the external borders;   organise, coordinate and conduct  return operations   *  and interventions.      Rescue operations   In accordance with international conventions such as the  International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea  , any vessels participating in maritime operations coordinated by the Agency are bound to provide assistance to people in distress at sea. The Agency assists the participating countries in conducting search and rescue operations in order to  protect and save lives  during border surveillance operations at sea.   Monitoring of migration flows and risk analysis    The Agency contributes to ensuring that  EU standards to protect and enforce border management  are implemented at all external borders.   EU countries’ and Schengen associate countries’ external borders will constantly be monitored by means of  risk analysis  and  mandatory vulnerability assessments  to identify and address weak spots.    EU border and coast guards    A rapid reaction pool of at least  1,500 border and coast guards  and a technical equipment pool are to be ready to react to any kind of pressure of illegal migration at the external borders.   Where necessary, the deployment of European Border and Coast Guard teams from the reaction pool will be immediately supplemented by additional border guards from EU countries.    Processing of personal data    The Agency is permitted to process personal data only for the purpose of risk analysis, organising operational activities including joint operations, rapid border interventions, return operations and return interventions  *  , and transmission to the competent national authorities or EU agencies, such as  EASO  ,  Europol  and  Eurojust  .   The Agency will manage the personal data of persons suspected of involvement in criminal activities, such as migrant smuggling, human trafficking and terrorism.    Repeal   Regulation (EU) 2016/1624 will be repealed and replaced on 31 December 2020 by Regulation (EU)  2019/1896  setting up a new enhanced European Border and Coast Guard — see  summary  .   from when does the regulation apply  The regulation entered into force on 6 October 2016. The rapid reaction and technical equipment pools have been in place since December 2016.   background   The establishment of a European Border and Coast Guard is one of the measures set out under the  European agenda on migration  to reinforce the management and security of the EU’s external borders.  See also    Securing Europe’s external borders: a European Border and Coast Guard  (  European Commission  )    Questions and answers: the European Border and Coast Guard Agency  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Joint operations:  operations coordinated by the Agency and involving human resources and technical equipment provided by one or more EU country.   Return operations:  where the Agency coordinates an operation which involves technical and operational reinforcement being provided by one or more EU countries, under which returnees from one or more countries are returned — either on a forced or voluntary basis.   Return interventions:  where the Agency provides EU countries with enhanced technical and operational assistance, consisting of the deployment of European return intervention teams to EU countries and coordinates return operations.
summary of   Regulation (EU) No 492/2011 on the right of EU workers to move within the EU   what is the aim of the regulation   It updates (and  codifies  ) earlier legislation on the ability of European Union citizens to move freely and to work in another EU country.   It also seeks to ensure that the principle of free movement enshrined in  Article 45  of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) is respected in practice.   key points    The free movement of labour benefits the individuals who choose to work elsewhere in the EU as well as the societies which receive them. It enables the former to exercise their right to free movement and to improve their personal and professional situation, and the latter to fill job vacancies and skills shortages.   Just as someone living in one EU country has the right to take up gainful employment in another, so can employers advertise job vacancies and agree contracts with potential employees from throughout the EU.   The legislation codifies and replaces Regulation (EEC) No  1612/68  , which was substantially amended several times. It ensures the system operates smoothly by  outlawing any form of nationality discrimination between EU workers  .   In particular, it bans:   separate recruitment procedures for foreign nationals; and   limits on advertising vacancies or the imposition of specific conditions such as registering with employment offices for people coming from another EU country.     Similarly, it is illegal  to discriminate  between national and other EU workers  on employment and work terms  , covering:    access to employment  , including the jobseekers’ assistance by employment offices;    working conditions  , including pay, dismissal, reinstatement or re-employment;    access to training  , including in vocational schools and retraining centres.     The same principle of  access to educational, apprenticeship and vocational training schemes  applies to the children of someone who is or has been working in another EU country.   The legislation covers certain  social rights  . A worker working in another EU country is entitled to the same social and tax advantages as nationals of the host EU country. He also has the right to housing benefits in the same conditions as nationals and may register on a housing list, where these exist, in the area where they are working.   The legislation also covers  equality of treatment  as regards  membership of trade unions  and the exercise of related rights, such as the right to vote and to be eligible for administrative or management posts in a trade union.   A certain level of  language knowledge  may be required for a job, but any language requirement must be reasonable and necessary for the job in question.   The legislation sets up an  Advisory Committee  comprising 6 members from each EU country: 2 representing the government, 2 the trade unions and 2 the employers’ associations. This committee assists the  European Commission  in matters concerning free movement of workers. The  European Labour Authority  , established by Regulation (EU)  2019/1149  participates in the committee’s meetings as an observer, providing technical input and expertise.    One exception   The one exception to the  non-discrimination principle  concerns access to posts involving the exercise of public authority and duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the state. EU countries may reserve such posts for their own nationals.   EURES regulation    In 2016, Regulation (EU) No  492/2011  was amended by Regulation (EU)  2016/589  on the  European Employment Services (EURES)  . As a result, the rules on the exchange of information on job vacancies, job applications and CVs across EU countries now fall within the scope of the new regulation.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 16 June 2011. Regulation (EU) No 492/2011  codified  and replaced Regulation (EEC) No  1612/68  and its subsequent amendments.   background   For more information, see:    Free movement — EU nationals  (  European Commission  ).

   Achieving the full benefits and potential of free movement of workers     Achieving the full benefits and potential of free movement of workers     The European Commission provides citizens with information on their fundamental rights in the area of free movement. In this way, it hopes to enable them to exercise these rights in practice and to create a European labour market.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 11 December 2002 - Free movement of workers: achieving the full benefits and potential [       COM(2002) 694      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Citizens who exercise their right to free movement of workers       *      within the European Union, which is a fundamental freedom under Community law, are contributing to the creation of a genuine European labour market.     However, practical, administrative and legal obstacles remain, preventing workers from taking full advantage of the benefits and potential of geographical mobility.     In this Communication, the Commission outlines the current state of Community law on the free movement of workers, with a view to clarifying its complex, technical legislative framework and the considerable case law of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in this area. It identifies a number of recurring difficulties in four distinct but interrelated areas.      Free movement of workers      Any national of a Member State has the right to work in another Member State.     Community law on free movement of workers applies whenever a national of an EU Member State exercises his right to mobility, even if he has returned to his Member State of origin after exercising his right to free movement of workers.     The family members       *      of an EU citizen who is a migrant worker, irrespective of their nationality - i.e. including third country nationals - are entitled to reside with him. In addition, children of migrant workers are entitled to access to education in the host Member State, irrespective of their nationality.     The right of residence is an integral part of free movement of workers. Under current Community law, Member States must issue a residence permit to a migrant worker on the basis of his identity card or passport and proof of employment alone. Under no circumstances may an EU citizen's access to employment be made conditional upon obtaining a residence permit.     It follows from the Community principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of nationality that migrant workers must be treated in the same way as national workers with regard to access to employment, conditions of employment and work and social and fiscal advantages.     On occasion, access to employment may be conditional upon linguistic requirements, provided they are reasonable and justified. Moreover, while a very good command of a particular language may be justifiable for certain jobs, a requirement for that language to be the worker's mother tongue is not acceptable.     Under the system of mutual       recognition of qualifications      , a Community citizen who is fully qualified in one Member State is entitled to exercise a regulated profession       *      in another Member State. Depending on the activity in question and the training completed, recognition will be either automatic or preceded by a period of adaptation or an aptitude test.      Social security      To facilitate the exercise of the right to free movement, migrant Community nationals must not suffer disadvantages in their social security rights.     Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 establishes a system for coordinating social security systems. It lays down common rules aimed at ensuring that the various national social security systems are not applied in such a way that they discriminate against persons who are exercising their right to free movement. Community law has never sought to harmonise the field of social security, and the Member States have therefore retained their competences with regard to the organisation of their respective social security systems.     As a general rule, social security benefits are paid regardless of the beneficiary's Member State of residence. Special non-contributory benefits represent an exception to this rule. These benefits are paid only in the Member States in which such benefits are provided. As a result, they cannot be exported, but a migrant EU citizen is entitled to the benefits provided by the host Member State. To satisfy the conditions for non-exportability, a benefit must be special and non-contributory. The ECJ has ruled that a benefit is special when it is closely linked to the social environment of the Member State in question (benefits related to the prevention of poverty or to care for the disabled).     Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 also lays down the conditions for access to health care for people moving within the European Union. Depending on personal status and/or type of stay, EU citizens are entitled to immediately necessary care, to care which becomes necessary, or to all sickness benefits in kind in a Member State other than the one in which they are insured against sickness as if they were insured there, but at the expense of the institution of insurance. For persons wishing to go to another Member State specifically to obtain treatment, the costs of such treatment will, under the co-ordination system set up by Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, only be covered by the Member State in which they are insured if they received prior authorisation. However, the Court has held that, in the light of other fundamental freedoms, such as the free movement of goods and the freedom to provide services, such prior authorisation, if not justified, could be regarded as an infringement of these fundamental freedoms. It follows that, under certain conditions, patients may apply for reimbursement of medical costs incurred in connection with health care received in another Member State, even in the absence of prior authorisation.     Finally, determination of the Member State whose social security legislation is applicable is based on two basic principles: a person is subject to the legislation of only one Member State at a time and is normally covered by the legislation of the Member State where he or she engages in occupational activity.     The complex nature of Regulation (EEC) No       1408/71      does, however, make it difficult to apply. For this reason, it is currently being       revised      .      Frontier workers      As they divide their time between two Member States, frontier workers       *      are often faced with practical problems related not only to social security and social advantages but also to income taxation and retirement. In principle, frontier workers enjoy all the benefits available to migrant workers in the Member State of employment, but some Member States impose residence conditions for entitlement to social advantages. Frontier workers are entitled to unemployment benefit in the Member State of residence rather than the Member State of employment. They may choose the Member State in which to obtain health care, but when they retire, this choice between Member State of employment and Member State of residence disappears.      Context      The legal texts which form the basis for the free movement of workers date back to the 1960s. They have since been supplemented by the Community institutions and, in particular, the case law of the ECJ.       Key terms used in the act         Worker: a person who undertakes genuine work under the direction of someone else, for which he is paid.         Family members: the spouse of the worker, his/her descendants who are under the age of 21 or are dependant, and dependant relatives in the ascending line. The term "spouse" means married partner and does not cover cohabiting partners.         Regulated profession: a profession that cannot be practised without certain specified vocational qualifications         Frontier worker: a person who lives in one Member State and works in another.       RELATED ACTS       Directive 2004/38/EC        of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States amending Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 and repealing Directives 64/221/EEC, 68/360/EEC, 72/194/EEC, 73/148/EEC, 75/34/EEC, 75/35/EEC, 90/364/EEC, 90/365/EEC and 93/96/EEC . [Official Journal L 158 of 30.04.2004].      This Directive is a partial response to some of the problems raised in the Communication. It makes the framework of legislation on freedom of movement for workers, which is both technical and complex, more accessible by combining into a single instrument provisions that are currently scattered among several different directives. It also provides a more precise definition of the concept of family member of a Union citizen and simplifies the formalities involved in exercising the right of stay.     Last updated: 24.08.2006  
summary of   Regulation (EC) No 336/2006 on the implementation of the International Safety Management Code within the EU   summary    what does this regulation do   It incorporates the ‘International management code for the safe operations of ships and for pollution prevention’ (  ISM Code  ) in the EU.   In particular, its objective is to ensure that shipping companies comply with the ISM Code by means of   establishment, implementation and proper maintenance of safety management systems on ships and on shore and   their control by flag state (i.e. the country in which a vessel is registered) and port state (i.e. the country at whose port a vessel calls or anchors) administrations.     key points    Scope   The regulation applies to the following types of ships and to companies operating them:   cargo ships and passenger ships, flying the flag of an EU country, engaged on international voyages;   cargo ships and passenger ships engaged exclusively on domestic voyages, regardless of their flag;   cargo ships and passenger ships operating to or from EU ports, on a regular shipping service, regardless of their flag;   mobile offshore drilling units operating under the authority of an EU country.   It does not apply to:   warships or troopships and other ships owned or operated by an EU country and used only on government non-commercial service;   ships not propelled by mechanical means, wooden ships of primitive build, pleasure yachts and pleasure craft, unless they are carrying more than 12 passengers for commercial purposes;   fishing vessels;   cargo ships and mobile offshore drilling units of less than 500 gross tonnage;   passenger ships, other than ro-ro (roll-on/roll-off) passenger ferries, in certain sea areas, as defined in Article 4 of Directive  2009/45/EC  .    Certification and verification   EU countries must comply with Part B of the ISM Code.   Exemptions   If an EU country considers it difficult in practice for some companies to comply with certain ISM Code rules for specific ships exclusively engaged on domestic voyages, it may exempt them from those rules by imposing equivalent measures.  In such a case, the EU country has to notify the  European Commission  accordingly. If the proposed exemption is not justified, the country has to amend or refrain from adopting these measures.   Penalties   EU countries must establish a system of effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for failure to comply with the regulation.   Reports   EU countries have to report to the Commission every 2 years on the implementation of the ISM Code. Based on this biennial report, the Commission prepares a consolidated report for the  European Parliament  and the  Council  .   from when does the regulation apply  It applies from 24 March 2006.   act   Regulation (EC) No  336/2006  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 February 2006 on the implementation of the International Safety Management Code within the Community and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 3051/95 (OJ L 64, 4.3.2006, pp. 1–36)  Successive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 336/2006 have been incorporated in the original text.

summary of   Regulation (EU) 2019/6 on veterinary medicinal products and repealing Directive 2001/82/EC   what is the aim of the regulation  It sets out rules for the sale, manufacture, import, export, supply, distribution, control and use of  veterinary medicinal products  (  VMPs  ), aiming to:   modernise legislation;   stimulate innovation in and increase the availability of VMPs;   strengthen the EU’s campaign against  antimicrobial resistance   *  .   key points   The regulation is part of a package of laws on improving animal and human health, which also includes:   Regulation (EU)  2019/4  on the manufacture, placing on the market and use of medicated feed; and   Regulation (EU)  2019/5  on procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a  European Medicines Agency  .    Veterinary medicinal products   A VMP is any substance intended for animals, which is used:   to treat or prevent disease;   to modify an animal’s physiological functions, through its effects as a drug on the animal’s immune system or metabolism (its internal life-maintaining processes);   for medical diagnosis; or   for euthanasia.    A modern innovative legal framework    The regulation specifies clear and fully harmonised  labelling requirements  , adopts a simpler system for  decisions on exceptions  , and a  risk-based approach to pharmacovigilance   *  and  controls  among the key measures.   Marketing authorisation must be granted by a competent authority or the  European Commission  .   Approval is needed for conducting clinical trials, taking care to  protect animals used for scientific purposes  .   Authorisation is needed for involvement at any stage of the manufacture of VMPs or for importing them.    Promoting availability of VMPs by stimulating innovation and competition    The regulation introduces a  simplified assessment procedure  and a  data protection period  , which could extend up to 18 years under certain conditions, designed to stimulate:   the  development of new antimicrobial VMPs  ;    new VMPs for rare diseases  ; and   VMPs for species such as bees, which are not food-producing animals or pets.     It defines clear rules for  organically sourced VMPs and novel therapies  which also aim to encourage the development of new VMPs.   In opening up the  centralised authorisation procedure  and allowing for a range of exceptions, marketing authorisations aim to positively broaden the range of VMPs which can be brought to the market.    Fighting antimicrobial resistance   The regulation continues and strengthens the EU’s fight against  EU’s fight against antimicrobial resistance  by introducing:   a ban on the preventive use of antibiotics in groups of animals;   a ban on the preventive use of antimicrobials via medicated feed;   restrictions on the use of antimicrobials as a control treatment to prevent a further spread of infection;   a reinforced ban on the use of antimicrobials for promoting growth and increasing yield (in addition to the 2006 prohibition of using antibiotics as growth promoters in feed);   the possibility to reserve certain antimicrobials for humans only;   the obligation for EU countries to collect data on the sale and use of antimicrobials;   science-based maximum limits for cross-contamination of feed with antimicrobials;   various measures aiming towards careful and responsible use of antimicrobials.   In addition, for their exports into the EU, non-EU countries will have to respect the ban on antimicrobials for promoting growth and increasing yield, as well as the restrictions on antimicrobials designated as reserved for human use in the EU. This improves the protection of consumers in the EU against the risk of antimicrobial resistance spread through imports of animals or products of animal origin.   Repeal   The regulation repeals Directive  2001/82/EC  (see summary on  EU rules on the authorisation, import and production of veterinary medicines  ) with effect from 27 January 2022.   from when does the regulation apply  It applies from 28 January 2022.   background   For more information, see:    Veterinary medicines and medicated feed  (  European Commission  )    EU Action on Antimicrobial Resistance  (  European Commission  )    Antimicrobial resistance in veterinary medicine  (  European Medicines Agency  ).   key terms    Antimicrobial resistance:  the ability of a microorganism (like bacteria, viruses, and some parasites) to stop an antimicrobial (such as antibiotics, antivirals and antimalarials) from working against it. Resistance means that standard treatments become ineffective, infections persist and could spread to others.   Pharmacovigilance:  the science and activities relating to the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of suspected adverse events or any other problem related to a medicinal product.
   Strategy for sustainable development     Strategy for sustainable development     The European Union has formulated a long-term strategy to dovetail the policies for economically, socially and environmentally sustainable development, its goal being sustainable improvement of the well-being and standard of living of current and future generations.     ACT     Commission Communication of 15 May 2001 ‘A Sustainable Europe for a Better World: A European Union Strategy for Sustainable Development’ (Commission proposal to the Gothenburg European Council) [       COM(2001) 264      final – not published in the Official Journal].     Commission Communication of 13 December 2005 on the review of the Sustainable Development Strategy – A platform for action [       COM(2005) 658      final – not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This strategy provides an EU-wide policy framework to deliver sustainable development, i.e. to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.     It rests on four separate pillars – economic, social, environmental and global governance – which need to reinforce one another. The economic, social and environmental consequences of all policies thus need to be examined in a coordinated manner and taken into account when those policies are being drawn up and adopted. The EU also needs to assume its international responsibilities with regard to sustainable development, whose various aspects – including democracy, peace, security and liberty – need to be promoted beyond EU borders.     This strategy, which complements the Lisbon Strategy, shall be a catalyst for policy makers and public opinion, to change society’s behaviour. It is built around measures covering the main challenges identified, as well as cross-cutting measures, adequate funding, the involvement of all stakeholders and effective policy implementation and follow-up.     The strategy is based on the following guiding principles: promotion and protection of fundamental rights, solidarity within and between generations, the guarantee of an open and democratic society, involvement of citizens, involvement of businesses and social partners, policy coherence and governance, policy integration, use of best available knowledge, the precautionary principle and the polluter-pays principle.      Measures for responding to the key challenges      The strategy identifies seven unsustainable trends on which action needs to be taken. This strategy lists a whole range of operational and numerical targets and specific measures at EU level to attain these objectives. These measures were updated and developed in the 2005 strategy review.     The first long-term specific objective of the strategy is to limit       climate change      and its effects by meeting commitments under the       Kyoto Protocol      and under the framework of the       European Strategy on Climate Change      . Energy efficiency, renewable energy and transport will be the subject of particular efforts.     Limiting the adverse effects of       transport      and reducing regional disparities is another long-term objective, for which there is a need to break the link between economic growth and transport growth and do more to develop transport that is environmentally friendly and conducive to health. The strategy envisages, among other measures, infrastructure charging, promotion of alternatives to road transport and vehicles which produce less pollution and use less energy.     To promote more sustainable       modes of production and consumption      the link between economic growth and environmental degradation needs to be broken and attention paid to how much ecosystems can tolerate. With this aim in view, the EU must among other things promote green public procurement, define environmental and social performance targets for products in cooperation with stakeholders, expand the distribution of environmental innovations and environmental technologies and produce information about and appropriate labelling of products and services.      Sustainable management of natural resources      is also an objective. From now until 2010 overexploitation needs to be avoided, efficiency of natural resource use improved, the value of ecosystem services recognised and loss of biodiversity halted. In particular the EU must make efforts in agriculture, fisheries and forest management; see to it that the Natura 2000 network is completed; define and implement priority actions to protect biodiversity, and make sure that aspects associated with the seas and oceans are duly taken into account. Recycling and re-use must also be supported.     Limiting major threats to       public health      is another of the strategy’s objectives. Food safety and quality must be ensured throughout the food chain. Threats to health and the environment posed by chemicals must be removed by 2020 and research into the links between health and pollutants must be developed. Issues relating to epidemics, resistance to antibiotics and lifestyle must be tackled, in particular to prepare for a possible pandemic and combat HIV/AIDS.     In order to combat       social exclusion and poverty      and mitigate the effects of an ageing society, the EU must promote active ageing and make efforts to ensure the viability of pension and social protection systems, integrate legal migrants and develop a Community immigration policy, improve the situation of families – especially of children – and promote equality between men and women.     The revised strategy also provides for strengthening       the fight against global poverty      , monitoring global sustainable development and compliance with international commitments. To achieve this, the EU must in particular increase the amount of aid provided to less favoured countries, improve the coherence and quality of development aid policies and promote better international governance.      Intersectoral measures      The       Knowledge Society      must be the driving force behind sustainable development. Special efforts need to be made in education and training for the greatest number of participants, so as to bring about a change in behaviour and give the public the necessary skills to meet the objectives laid down in the strategy. Scientific and technical innovation also needs to be stimulated, especially through framework programmes of research and development and in association with universities, research institutes, businesses and government officials.      Financial and economic instruments      are another way to engender a market that offers less polluting products and services and to change consumer behaviour. Prices therefore need to reflect actual environmental and social costs, whereas fiscal measures should be applied to energy and resource consumption and/or pollution. In addition, financial support from European funds must be coordinated between the Commission and Member States to optimise efficiency.     Better       communication      will help involve businesses and the public. Stress is laid on the importance of systematic dialogue with consumers and of consulting other countries in order to mobilise the efforts of all parties. The different parties, including public administrations (European and national), businesses and the public (including non-governmental organisations) must establish partnerships among themselves.      Formulation of policies and review of progress      Member States must draw up national strategies and regularly review progress accomplished. They must carry out impact assessments before adopting their policies or committing public funds.     All the instruments available to the public authorities must be used to contribute to sustainable development. This includes regulations, but also incentives or market based instruments.     The Commission evaluates the implementation of the strategy once every two years on the basis of       sustainable development indicators      that it has adopted and, where necessary, updated. This evaluation forms the basis of another, carried out once every two years by the December European Council. Other bodies and institutions also examine what has been achieved and establish links with Member States and the public if required. The strategy provides for a review of its objectives by Council decision no later than 2011.      Background      The main lines of the strategy that the Commission proposed in 2001 were set out in the conclusions of the       Gothenburg European Council      of June 2001. It also formed part of the European Union’s preparatory work for the 2002 world summit on sustainable development (Rio + 10) held in Johannesburg. Before that summit the Commission presented another communication on how the Union should contribute towards sustainable development in the world; elements of that communication were incorporated into the strategy when it was reviewed.     A public consultation on the sustainable development strategy was organised following the appointment of the new Commission in 2004. The Commission also drew up a communication taking an overall look at the progress made thanks to the sustainable development strategy, referring to the main findings of the consultation and setting out broad orientations for review of the strategy.     For its part, the Brussels European Council of June 2005 reaffirmed both the key objectives of sustainable development and the guiding principles which need to underpin the renewed strategy.     In December 2005, the Commission adopted a communication in which it:      determines the main areas which require a fresh impetus in the years to come. It points out that these areas are interdependent and require responses based on cooperation and solidarity, on research and innovation and on the education of the population;       proposes to take more account of the impact of European policies on sustainable development at world level;       proposes methods to measure the progress achieved and regularly review priorities at national and Community levels;       recommends a permanent dialogue with the individuals and organisations – company heads, regional and local authorities, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), etc. – involved in sustainable development.      This communication underpinned the adoption of a new EU Sustainable Development Strategy at the       Brussels European Council      of June 2006.     RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 24 July 2009 - Mainstreaming sustainable development into EU policies : 2009 Review of the European Union Strategy for Sustainable Development [         COM(2009) 400        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      This Review reports on the policy developments carried out at European level following the adoption of the European Union Strategy for Sustainable Development. In this regard, the European Union plays an important role in the fight against climate change and in promoting a low-carbon economy.     However, progress in sustainable development still needs to be made and the Review opens a discussion on how the strategy can be improved. It should be better coordinated with other European policy strategies, particularly with the Lisbon Strategy on Growth and Jobs. The implementation of the strategy should be streamlined in order to improve its management and its actual results.      Commission Communication of 22 October 2007 ‘Progress Report on the Sustainable Development Strategy 2007’ [         COM(2007) 642        final – not published in the Official Journal].      In this report the Commission considers that progress achieved on the ground has been modest, but great advances in EU and Member State policy development have occurred in many areas, in particular climate change, clean energy and health.

The Commission takes stock of progress since 2001, even though immediate results cannot be expected. The Commission also sets out the future orientations which should guide the review of the strategy, specifically:      reaffirming the new approach to policy making and policy coherence (impact assessment, stakeholder consultation, regulatory simplification, market-based instruments);       pursuing action on key unsustainable trends (assessment of these trends and the linkages between them);       setting new priority objectives and targets, together with intermediate milestones to measure progress;       reinforcing the monitoring of the strategy;       strengthening ownership of the strategy (awareness-raising and mobilisation) and improving cooperation with public and private actors.       Sustainable development indicators to monitor the implementation of the EU sustainable development strategy [SEC(2005) 161 - not published in the Official Journal].      The Commission presents a list of indicators for monitoring the implementation of the political priorities which were agreed at the Gothenburg and Barcelona European Councils or which relate to the commitments entered into by the European Union at the Johannesburg world summit on sustainable development. The list takes the form of a hierarchical framework of 12 headline indicators (corresponding to the main sustainable development themes identified at European and international level), 45 core policy indicators (corresponding to the key objectives of each theme) and 98 analytical indicators (corresponding to measures implementing the key objectives).

   The EU drugs strategy (2005-12)     The EU drugs strategy (2005-12)     In December 2004, the European Council approved the EU drugs strategy for the period 2005-12. The main aim is to attain a high level of health protection and well-being by complementing Member States’ action in preventing and reducing drug use and drug dependence. It is also intended to ensure a high level of security for the general public by taking action against drug production and cross-border trafficking in drugs, as well as by strengthening EU coordination mechanisms to ensure that measures are complementary at national, regional and international levels.     ACT     Note from the Council of 22 November 2004 on the EU Drugs Strategy for the period 2005-2012 [15074/04 – Not published in the Official Journal] (       pdf      ).     SUMMARY     The Council identifies two general aims with regard to drugs:      the EU seeks to achieve a high level of         health protection        , well-being and social cohesion by complementing the efforts of Member States to prevent and reduce drug use, dependence and drug-related damage to health and society;       the EU and its Member States strive to ensure a high level of security for the general public by taking action against drug production, cross-border trafficking in drugs and the diversion of chemical precursors used in drug production, as well as by intensifying preventive action against drug-related crime through effective cooperation embedded in a joint approach.      The strategy concentrates on two policy fields       –      demand reduction and supply reduction       –      and on two cross-cutting themes       –      international cooperation and research, information and evaluation.      Field of action: demand reduction      The following priorities have been identified in the area of demand reduction:      improving access to and effectiveness of prevention programmes and raising awareness thereof;       improving access to early intervention programmes or measures;       improving access to targeted and diversified treatment programmes;       improving access to services for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS.       Field of action: supply reduction      The following priorities have been identified in the area of supply reduction:      strengthening EU law enforcement cooperation at both strategic and crime prevention levels;       intensifying effective law enforcement cooperation between Member States by using existing instruments and frameworks;       preventing the illicit import and export of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, including to other Member States;       enhancing law enforcement, criminal investigation and forensic science cooperation between Member States that have common interests and/or face the same drug-related problems;       intensifying law enforcement efforts directed at non-EU countries, especially producer countries and regions along trafficking routes.      The focus will be on production, illicit (intra-EU) cross-border drug trafficking, criminal networks engaged in these activities and related serious crime. The flow of drugs from the EU to third countries must also be curbed.     Many instruments and frameworks have been established to reduce supply, including the framework decision laying down minimum provisions on the constituent elements of       criminal acts and applicable penalties      in the field of drug trafficking, joint investigation teams, the       European arrest warrant      ,       Europol      and       Eurojust      , the       financial intelligence unit      , confiscation of assets measures, and the       United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime      and its Protocols.      Cross-cutting theme: international cooperation      The following priorities have been identified in the area of external relations:      coordinated, effective and more visible action by the Union in international organisations and fora to enhance and promote a balanced approach to the drugs problem;       special efforts in relation to the candidate countries and potential candidate countries, such as the countries of the stabilisation and association process;       assisting third countries, including neighbouring European countries and key drug-producing and transit countries, to be more effective in drug demand and supply reduction, both through closer cooperation among EU-Member States and by mainstreaming drug issues into the general common foreign and security policy dialogue and development cooperation. New cooperation agreements between the EU and third countries should continue to include a specific clause on cooperation in drugs control.       Cross-cutting theme: information, research and evaluation      The following priorities have been identified in the field of information and research:      improving EU knowledge infrastructure in the field of drugs and consolidating the         drug information systems        and tools developed over the 2000-04 period, making full use of the         European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction        (EMCDDA) and Europol;       each EU action plan should include priority research topics to be fostered at EU level, taking into account the rapid evolution of the drugs problem.      As regards evaluation, the EU drugs strategy 2005-12 makes clear that it is an integral part of an EU approach to drugs policy that serves to give clear indications about the merits and shortcomings of current actions and activities at EU level.      Coordination      The action plans should include initiatives that will contribute to the further development of a European coordination mechanism. EU-level coordination of drugs policy should take place through the Council’s Horizontal Drugs Group (HDG), whose function is to prepare a clear and coherent drugs policy for adoption by the Council. If it is to play a leading role in the drugs field, the HDG needs to be kept informed of relevant developments at national level and of activities carried out by other relevant Council working groups.      Monitoring      In 2012, the Commission will organise an overall evaluation of the EU drugs strategy and action plans for the Council and the European Parliament, in cooperation with the EMCDDA, Europol and the Member States.      Background      The current drug situation in the EU is described in the annual reports of the EMCDDA and Europol. The results of the final evaluation of the EU drugs strategy 2000-04 and the       action plan on drugs 2000-04      indicate that progress has been made in achieving some of the targets, although the available data does not suggest that there has been a significant reduction in the prevalence of drug use or that the availability of drugs has been substantially reduced.     At its meeting of 17-18 June 2004, the European Council invited the Council to adopt proposals by no later than December 2004 for a new EU drugs strategy for the period 2005-12. This strategy builds on the previous strategy and its action plan, taking into consideration these texts as well as the mid-term evaluation of the action plan, the Council’s response to this evaluation and the results of the final evaluation.     RELATED ACTS       EU Drugs Action Plan for 2009-2012        of 20 December 2008 [Official Journal C 326 of 20.12.2008].      The EU drugs action plan 2009-12 follows on from that of 2005-08. It builds on the measures established to implement the EU drugs strategy 2005-12, thereby aiming to reduce the demand for and supply of drugs. To that end, the action plan sets out five priority areas with specific actions that coordinate drugs policy at national and European levels.

The Commission, wishing to boost coordination on drugs at EU level, explains what is needed and what is at stake, pointing to the main existing models of coordination and emphasising the key elements of effective interaction. It recommends, in particular, incorporating all aspects of drug-related policy (social and health aspects, enforcement measures, youth policy), close cooperation between law enforcement bodies and coordination between them and social and health services, as well as systematic development of the evaluation of strategies and activities in this field.

In parallel, the EU is taking its own initiatives. The communication sets out a gradual approach for including shipping in its overall target to reduce GHG emissions.   key points   This gradual approach contains the following three steps.    1.     Applying an effective   monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) system  . This would establish reliable data on shipping’s GHG emissions. Ship-owners would be able to use whichever reliable methodology they wished. A  proposed regulation  sets out the scope and operational features of such a system.      2.     Setting intermediary reduction targets  . Legislation already exists for all other industrial sectors and forms of transport to contribute to the EU’s target of cutting GHG emissions by at least 40 % below 1990 levels by 2030. This could be extended to shipping. The  2011 White Paper  on transport established a reduction target of 40 % (if feasible, 50 %) by 2050, compared to 2005, as an aspirational goal for maritime shipping.      3.     Using market-based measures (MBMs)  . These could require a vessel to pay into a compensation fund or to exchange allowances within the EU’s  emissions trading system  , depending on the level of emissions it produces.     background   EU shipping accounts for 4 % of all EU GHG emissions. However, these are set to increase significantly in the future - possibly by 50 % by 2050, compared to 2010 levels. Reducing these emissions will not only help tackle climate change, but it will also reduce fuel consumption and a vessel’s operating costs.

   Financial and technical cooperation with the West Bank and the Gaza Strip     Financial and technical cooperation with the West Bank and the Gaza Strip     This Regulation establishes the conditions and areas of financial and technical cooperation with the West Bank and the Gaza Strip with a view to contributing to economic, political and social development in the region. It will be replaced by the European Neighbourhood instrument when this comes into force.     ACT     Council Regulation (EC) No       1734/94      of 11 July 1994 on financial and technical cooperation with the West Bank and Gaza Strip [       see amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     1. Originally titled "On financial and technical cooperation with the Occupied Territories", the Regulation sets up financial and technical cooperation with the West Bank and Gaza Strip.     2. The financial and technical cooperation is intended to contribute to sustainable economic, political and social development in the region, with multi-annual programmes where possible.     3. Projects and operations under the Regulation cover infrastructure, production, urban and rural development, education, health, the environment, services, foreign trade, job creation, institution building, promotion of democracy and human rights and development of civil society. These activities are financed by grants and 3% interest rate subsidies.     4. Apart from the States and regions involved, other local, regional, private and non-Governmental bodies may also benefit from the support measures. Participation in invitations to tender and contracts is open on equal terms to all natural and legal persons in the Member States and in the Mediterranean partner States.     5. The aid may be combined with European Investment Bank (EIB) financing from own resources and may be used for co-financing with Member States, non-member countries in the region, multilateral bodies or the West Bank and Gaza Strip themselves.     6. The Commission is assisted by the MED Committee set up under Regulation (EC) No       1488/96      for financing decisions on the following matters:      projects and operations under the Regulation for amounts of over EUR 2 million other than those relating to interest rate subsidies on EIB loans;       financing decisions on overall allocations for technical cooperation, training and trade promotion.      7. Within an overall allocation, the Commission adopts financing decisions not exceeding EUR 2 000 000. It also adopts decisions amending financing decisions where they do not entail any substantial amendments or additional commitments in excess of 20 % of the original commitment. The financing decisions are subject to supervision and financial control by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), including on-the-spot audits and checks, and audits by the Court of Auditors.

   Organisation and management of the internet     Organisation and management of the internet     This Communication reports on developments in the field of the organisation and management of the Internet over the period 1998-2000. In particular, it analyses the transfer to the private sector of a number of functions relating to the organisation and management of the Internet, and presents the major issues in this field both within the European Union and internationally.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 11 April 2000 to the Council and the European Parliament "The organisation and management of the internet. International and European policy issues 1998-2000" [       COM(2000) 202      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The Internet is a communications network that should be universally accessible. The IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority), a body under contract with the United States Government, was set up in order to administer the central coordinating functions of the global Internet for the pubic good. The US Government has furthermore recognised that the global Internet user community should have a voice in the coordination of the Internet.      The new structure of the management body      In October 1998, ICANN (the Internet Corporation for Assigned Numbers and Names) was set up on the basis of a US Government White Paper. ICANN is incorporated as a non-profit public-benefit corporation in the county of Los Angeles, California. It will be responsible for coordinating the management of the Domain Name System (DNS), the allocation of Internet protocol address spaces, the coordination of new Internet coordination parameters and the management of the Internet's root name server system. All these functions are due to be transferred to ICANN by October 2000.     ICANN began its work in autumn 1998. Its Board currently consists of nine temporary members appointed by the IANA, and nine members elected by the technical (naming, addressing, standardisation) organisations. The intention is that by 2002, nine members will be elected by on-line voting to replace the temporary members.     ICANN's budget comes from contributions from:      domain name registries;       domain name registrars and;       IP address registries.      ICANN is assisted in its work by a Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) which is open to all governments and a number of international organisations with a direct interest in ICANN policy, including ITU, WIPO, OECD etc.     The Commission urges the Member States and the European Parliament to facilitate the participation of all Internet user categories within this management body.      Internet protocols      Internet protocols allow the different entities on the Internet to work together to transport data between machines and present it in the applications that the users actually see. The development of new protocols is fundamental to the development of new services on the Internet.     Recognising the importance of the protocols, the Commission will take them into account in its approach to IT standardisation, including EU research projects.      Internet addressing      The Internet addresses which are used to route data from one host computer to another are numerical. This numerical system is currently based on numbers that are 32 bits long (IPv4). All Internet applications, both current and future, rely on these addresses, and the Ipv4 address space has been coming under increasing pressure because of the growth of the use of the Internet.     The Commission therefore considers that it should closely monitor developments in ICANN and its policies with regard to the allocation of IP addresses. It is important that IP addresses are autonomously and neutrally managed. The rapid development of the Internet necessitates the transition to a new generation of Ipv6 addresses based on 128 bit numbers, which will multiply the number of addresses available to users. Internet search and directory services will also need to be developed.      Domain names      Domain names are names by which Internet hosts may be easily identified, as opposed to the numerical IP addressing system used for network communication. Two types of registry are in current use:      a number of generic top-level domains (gTLDs), such as ".COM", ".NET", are used worldwide;       about 240 national or territorial registries maintain similar systems of names under a country code (ccTLD registries), such as ".GR", ".BE".      ICANN (taking over from the IANA) will be responsible for the attribution of registries. One of its main functions is to introduce competition into the registration market for gTLD domain names and increase the number of TLDs available.     ICANN has already accredited a number of registrars in order to encourage competition.      The ".EU" top-level domain      Given the rapid expansion of the Internet, the Commission considers it vital to create an "       .EU      " European top-level TLD registry, in order to give the Internet domain space in Europe an additional dimension for identification and growth.      Intellectual property rights (IPR)      The main IPR questions arising from domain names are currently trademark-related. Domain names have been an easy target for abuses of       intellectual property      rights, given that the principal open generic domains have been allocated on a "first come, first (only) served" basis.     The Commission will continue discussions with WIPO (he World Intellectual Property Organisation) and the US authorities on dispute resolution and the implementation of international dispute resolution mechanisms. It also intends to submit a proposal for a code of conduct to restrict current abuses of intellectual property rights. This will include identification of the categories of names to be protected and the treatment of trademarks and other recognised marks.      Data protection      Under the Registrars Accreditation Agreement, anyone applying to register a domain name must provide information to the registry and the WHOIS database. Personal data is covered by Directive 95/46/EC (       protection of personal data      ). Neither the Registrars, nor the registries, nor ICANN can claim any rights over this type of information.     Transparency and access to WHOIS data are fundamental for Internet users. Transparency can help to reduce disputes concerning trademarks and even prevent fraud. However, there is also a need for data security and confidentiality.     The Commission will continue discussions with ICANN and the US authorities regarding data protection and may also recommend that ICANN and the GAC adopt policies limiting the collection, processing and use of personal registration data.      Competition policy      The Commission will closely monitor developments regarding the organisation and management of the Internet, and will ascertain whether agreements and business registration practices fall under EU competition rules.     In the case of generic top-level domain (gTLD) registries, registrars have to submit their registration requests to NSI (Network Solutions Incorporated). ICANN regards this as being a factor for uncertainty, and wishes to upgrade the US-based monopolistic infrastructure towards a more balanced international environment.      Internet infrastructure      If Europe is to be able to rise to the international challenges where the Internet is concerned, it is necessary that the current disparities in terms of access, use, content and cost can be rapidly reduced through: less expensive access, availability of European websites, more extensive use of all European languages, availability of efficient backbone infrastructure, and security of commercial transactions.     The Commission has set out its objectives with regard to the development of the information society in its "       eEurope      " communication. It also invites the Member States to act as expeditiously as possible to implement its recommendations on leased-line pricing and       unbundling of the local loop      in order to accelerate affordable Internet access.

summary of   Directive 2003/8/EC — improved access to justice in cross-border disputes by establishing minimum common rules relating to legal aid   what is the aim of this directive  It seeks to:   improve access to justice in  cross-border civil cases;    establish  EU-wide rules  on legal aid;   make sure people who  cannot afford  legal help have access to it;   encourage  cooperation  on legal aid between EU countries.   key points   This directive covers all  civil matters  , including:   business,   employment,   consumer protection.   It gives people who cannot afford legal representation the  right to legal aid  . It is for EU citizens and nationals of non-EU countries living in the EU.   Legal aid  may include:    legal advice,    legal assistance and  representation in court,    exemption from  court fees,    exemption from certain  fees in international cases  (e.g. interpretation, translation, travel).   In addition, the directive introduces  rules  on  processing applications  .   National authorities must:   make sure  applicants understand  how applications are processed;    explain  why they reject an application;   let applicants  appeal  against rejection.     To speed up applications, EU countries must provide the  European Commission  with a list of:    authorities  that can send and receive applications   the  languages  in which they accept applications.      Standard application forms    Commission Decision  2004/844/EC  establishes a standard form for legal aid applications.   Commission Decision  2005/630/EC  sets out the standard form for sending legal aid applications between EU countries.   EU countries must ensure that the public and professional circles are informed via the  European Judicial Network  .  EU countries can make  more generous arrangements  for legal aid applicants if they want.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 31 January 2003. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 30 November 2004. The directive does not apply in Denmark.   background    In 2000, the European Commission published a  Green Paper on legal aid in civil matters  with a view to taking stock of difficulties encountered by cross-border litigants and proposing solutions.   The Commission initiative was all the more necessary since existing conventions on the matter (the  1977 Strasbourg Agreement on the Transmission of Legal Aid Applications  and  the Hague Convention to Facilitate the International Access to Justice  , signed in 1980) had not been ratified by all EU countries.   For more information, see:    ‘Legal aid’  on the e-Justice portal.
   Assisting developing countries to benefit from trade     Assisting developing countries to benefit from trade     The European Union defines practical steps to improve the integration of trade into development strategies so that it contributes to the fundamental objectives of poverty reduction and sustainable development.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament, "Trade and development: assisting developing countries to benefit from trade" [       COM(2002) 513      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY      STEPPING UP DIALOGUE WITH PARTNER COUNTRIES       Trade reform in poverty reduction strategies      The European Union is committed to placing greater emphasis on trade issues in its political dialogue with the developing countries to improve the integration of trade policies into poverty reduction strategies. Trade policy must be integrated in such a way that it contributes to the fundamental objectives of poverty reduction and sustainable development. It should foster equitable growth, promote human development, and ensure the proper management of natural resources and the protection of the environment.      Adapting trade-related assistance to each country's specific conditions      To that end, the Commission must ensure that the financing of trade-related assistance, which is one of the six priority areas for       development policy      laid down in 2000, is adapted to needs, particularly for least developed countries. Assistance should ideally be adapted in the light of a national dialogue involving government, the private sector and representatives from labour and civil society.      ENHANCED EFFECTIVENESS OF EU SUPPORT      Political dialogue is translated into practical assistance by country and regional strategy papers. Trade issues and their linkages with other policies important for sustainable development need to be addressed at each stage of the preparation of strategy papers.     The Commission also proposes reinforcing, where appropriate and in consultation with the partner country/region, the trade component when programming EU development assistance. This will be done by including:       Support for macroeconomic and fiscal reforms:        Support to enhance trade capacity should also aim for sound macro-economic and tax policies, to achieve a policy mix that is conducive to improved trading conditions and economic and financial stability.        Support for the restructuring and competitiveness of production:        In order to support the repositioning process and increase the competitiveness of the private sector in developing countries, a variety of private-sector facilities have been set up at both national and regional levels. Strengthening support services and improving infrastructure has been another core area of EU support.        Support for the restructuring and competitiveness of production:        Regional integration is supported in the framework of the development strategy. This is the South-South-North approach. Under this approach, the EU is negotiating agreements with regional groupings. It is doing so in South America, with the Mercosur countries, in the Mediterranean, and in South-East Asia. But this approach applies in particular to the economic partnership agreements between the African, Caribbean and Pacific states (ACP) and the EU, for which negotiations started in September 2002.        Support for genuine participation in the multilateral trading system:        EU assistance in this area is mainly oriented towards assistance for accession to the         World Trade Organisation        (WTO) and multilateral trade negotiations, support for the implementation of existing and future WTO agreements requiring major financial input, and support for the policy reforms and investment necessary to enhance economic efficiency and ensure greater participation in the world economy. This last area notably includes reform of customs administrations, standards and conformity assessment, services, investment, intellectual property rights, competition policy, the adoption of legislation for appropriate labour standards, and environmental standards.      The Commission is also examining the scope for funding trade-related assistance initiatives that benefit all developing countries, especially in collaboration with multilateral agencies. At present, practically all EU development assistance is provided on a country/region basis. Yet this is an area in which it is very important to support multilateral initiatives in collaboration with international organisations, without confining them to specific countries or regions.      CONTRIBUTION TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNATIONAL ACTION      It is important to make the most of the linkages between trade and all other areas important for sustainable development, and to ensure the consistency between the various EU policies with an external dimension.     There is a need to review existing mechanisms to improve coordination with Member States and to promote a greater exchange of "best practices" between the Commission and Member States and between Member States themselves.     Closer cooperation with international organisations with specific expertise in trade and trade-related matters is also encouraged.     The EU should also encourage regional development banks (such as the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the Interamerican Development Bank) to devote additional resources to capacity-building programmes in the sphere of trade.     The communication encourages the EU to support the WTO Secretariat in matters of technical assistance, and to continue contributing to the       Trust Fund for the Doha Development Agenda      .

   Protection of air passengers     Protection of air passengers     Following this Communication, the Commission launched a campaign to inform air passengers of their rights under Community legislation. The Commission presents its legislative strategy, which aims to give more protection to the interests of air passengers. At the same time, it will seek to obtain voluntary commitments from airlines and compare their performance. It will also aim to achieve better representation for the interests of air passengers.     ACT     Commission Communication of 21 June 2000 to the European Parliament and to the Council regarding the protection of air passengers in the European Union [       COM(2000) 365      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This Communication is based on the results of a consultative document launched by the Commission. This document, which was addressed to organisations representing airlines, passengers and airports, concerned the problems encountered by air passengers and possible solutions.      Air passengers and their protection      Growth of air transport, stimulated by the development of the single market, is giving rise to much dissatisfaction today in terms of the quality of service provided by airlines. In spite of numerous measures already taken at Community level (compensation for       denied boarding      ,       liability in case of accidents      , a       code of conduct for computerised reservation systems      and       package travel      ), it appears that passengers have little knowledge of their rights. This has led the Commission to launch an awareness campaign through the display of a "charter of passenger's rights" in European airports (available in all languages as a PDF document available for download on the website of DG Energy and Transport).     The policy proposed in this Communication combines both Community law, through various legislative acts, and voluntary commitments by the air transport sector. The Commission is counting on the cooperation of the airlines and airports to allow looser European legislation, preferring solutions negotiated on a voluntary basis. There is a need to avoid overregulation so as not to lessen the scope for competition or hamper cooperation between airlines.     The Commission points out that future legislation will seek a balance between legal certainty for passengers and for airlines, while guaranteeing more rights for passengers. They must be able to obtain accurate and up-to-date information on airlines' performance so that they can make informed choices. Moreover, the difficulty of settling disputes must be addressed. The handling of complaints is often disappointing. Besides, representation of passenger interests is often weak when compared with very influential airlines.      Commission proposals      The Commission is proposing to base its action on both legislation and voluntary commitments. The legislation to be proposed will have three objectives:      enable delayed passengers to continue their journeys under good conditions, by giving them the right either to reimbursement of the ticket or to an alternative flight at the earliest opportunity;       create new rights for passengers, by setting minimum requirements for air travel contracts. The aim would be to create certainty for passengers by requiring the airlines to draft contracts clearly setting out the services offered and the conditions applied. The Commission also wishes to improve the balance of contracts in favour of passengers;       give passengers the information they need to make well-founded choices between airlines. The Commission is proposing, on the basis of data submitted by the airlines, to publish regular reports for consumers.      The voluntary commitments concern:      improvement of service quality (lower fares, better information, easier complaints procedures);       care for delayed passengers;       simpler procedures for lodging complaints and mechanisms for settling disputes out of court.      The Commission is also proposing to involve airports in this attempt to improve service to passengers.      Commission work programme      In 2000, the Commission set out the following tasks:      discuss how best to strengthen the representation of passengers with Member States and passengers' organisations.       examine the effects of Internet sales and reservations on the market and competition rules.       study the effects on competition of code sharing and of tariff coordination in interlining.       assess the impact of cabin conditions on passengers' health.

   Improving tyres’ fuel efficiency, braking capacity and noise levels (until April 2021)     Improving tyres’ fuel efficiency, braking capacity and noise levels (until April 2021)     SUMMARY OF:      Regulation (EC) No 1222/2009 on the labelling of tyres with respect to fuel efficiency and other essential parameters      WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?     Good quality tyres can significantly reduce fuel consumption and therefore CO       2      emissions. To help consumers choose a product that is more fuel efficient, has better wet braking and is less noisy, they need clear and relevant information about the quality of the tyres.     This regulation aims to harmonise information concerning the energy performance of tyres, as well as on wet braking and external rolling noise.     It is repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU)       2020/740      (see       summary      ) as of 30 April 2021.     KEY POINTS     The regulation applies to       C1, C2 and C3 tyres       *      and excludes:      re-treaded tyres;       off-road professional tyres;       tyres designed to be fitted only to vehicles registered for the first time before 1 October 1990;       T-type temporary-use spare tyres         *        ;       tyres with a speed rating of less than 80 km/h;       tyres with a nominal rim diameter not exceeding 254 mm or of 635 mm or more;       tyres fitted with additional devices to improve traction properties (for example studded tyres);       tyres designed only to be fitted on vehicles intended exclusively for racing.       Responsibilities of tyre suppliers      Tyre suppliers must monitor the labelling of C1, C2 and C3 tyres delivered to distributors and consumers. This labelling includes a sticker, which must indicate:      the fuel efficiency class (letter A to G);       the wet grip class (letter A to G) — the tests for wet grip performance on the different tyre classes are amended and supplemented by Regulations (EU) No         228/2011        and (EU) No         1235/2011        ;       the external rolling noise measured value (in decibels).      Suppliers must declare this information publicly, such as on their website or in catalogues.      Responsibilities of tyre distributors      Distributors must ensure that the labels delivered by suppliers are clearly visible on the tyres presented or stored at the point of sale. If tyres cannot be seen by consumers, distributors must supply this information to consumers themselves.      Responsibilities of car suppliers and car distributors      If consumers can choose their tyres, car suppliers and car distributors must provide them with performance information in terms of fuel efficiency, wet braking and rolling noise for each option.      Repeal      Regulation (EC) No 1222/2009 is repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU)       2020/740      as of 30 April 2021.     FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?     It has applied since 1 November 2012.     KEY TERMS      C1, C2 and C3 tyres:      as defined in Regulation (EC) No       661/2009      (see       summary      ):        C1 tyres — primarily for cars;         C2 tyres — primarily for light commercial vehicles, such as vans;         C3 tyres — primarily for heavy vehicles (trucks and buses).        T-type, temporary-use spare tyres:      designed for use at inflation pressures higher than those for standard and reinforced tyres.     MAIN DOCUMENT     Regulation (EC) No       1222/2009      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the labelling of tyres with respect to fuel efficiency and other essential parameters (OJ L 342, 22.12.2009, pp. 46-58)     Successive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1222/2009 have been incorporated in the original text.

   Satellite navigation applications     Satellite navigation applications     This Commission Green Paper sets out the various applications which the introduction of the       Galileo      satellite navigation system should open up. The idea is to launch a debate on the resources to be applied by the public sector to develop the right policy and legal framework for taking full advantage of the deployment of Galileo.     ACT     Green Paper of 12 December 2006 on Satellite Navigation Applications [       COM(2006) 769      final - Not published in the Official Journal]     SUMMARY     The market in products and services generated by the introduction of satellite navigation is forecast to reach 400 billion by 2025. Galileo, a flagship programme of European space policy, together with Egnos, is part of the GNSS (global navigation satellite system) providing a range of positioning, navigation and timing services.     The Green Paper also underscores the Commission's aim of fostering innovation in the wider context of the Lisbon strategy, under which the public sector should promote the EU's competitiveness at world level.     The Green Paper outlines the sectors set to benefit from the introduction of the Galileo system as a result of the large number of applications that it will be possible to develop. The areas of application for satellite navigation include:       location-based services and emergency calls        : through the integration of the Galileo system's receivers in a large number of devices such as mobile phones, location-based services and personal mobility are the main markets for satellite navigation. Customers will be able to access specific "vicinity" information (the nearest hospital or the best way to a restaurant, etc.);        road transport        : this area also covers a wide range of applications, from navigation devices to automatic toll systems, safety applications and pay-per-use insurance. Galileo thus ties in with the         eSafety        initiative, which includes a wide range of applications that could make use of accurate vehicle positioning;        rail transport        : railway infrastructure includes signalling and train location systems, mainly installed at track side. These are gradually being replaced by the ERTMS/ETCS systems. Galileo will help to improve the safety of train speed control and operating systems;        maritime, inland waterway and fisheries navigation        : the efficiency, safety and optimisation of marine transportation can benefit from satellite navigation. Galileo should provide benefits for safety applications, safety improvements and automatic identification systems (AISs). It can also be used for port approaches. Directive         2005/44/EC        recommends the use of satellite positioning technologies for vessel tracking and tracing in inland waterway transport;        air transport        : satellite navigation opens up highly interesting prospects in this field. The analyses point to strong growth in air traffic up to 2025. The accuracy and integrity of the Galileo system will enable the use of existing airports to be optimised. The         SESAR        joint undertaking, which implements the legal framework laid down in the single European sky regulations, will also rely on satellite navigation;        civil protection, emergency management and humanitarian aid        : helping people after earthquakes, floods, tsunamis and other natural or man-made disasters requires the location of people, assets and resources. Satellite navigation should shorten the response times of rescue services and optimise their deployment;        dangerous goods        : the legal framework will need to be updated to take account of the many options that Galileo will offer. In the event of problems, satellite navigation can also improve emergency response;        livestock transport        : every year millions of animals are transported in the European Union. Traceability of livestock is of paramount importance to prevent sanitary fraud, ensure food safety and protect animal welfare. Regulation (EC) No         1/2005        , which lays down the requirements for the transport of animals, requires the use of satellite navigation systems in all new trucks for long journeys;        agriculture, parcel measurement, geodesy and cadastral survey        : 11 million farmers grow crops on 110 million hectares of land in the EU. The location and size of parcels are key data for use in information exchange, whether for commercial purposes or applying for subsidies. Monitoring payments under the common agricultural policy requires increasingly detailed information. Farmers also make use of satellite navigation to optimise crops, reduce fertiliser and pesticide inputs and ensure effective use of land and water. Satellite navigation systems can also simplify and improve the quality of data collection in geodesy and cadastral surveys;        energy, oil and gas        : industry makes extensive use of satellite navigation systems for exploration and exploitation. The safety and security of oil and gas transport can also benefit from the positioning functions offered by Galileo. It can also improve the synchronisation of electricity distribution networks;        search and rescue services        : by allowing near real-time reception of distress messages from anywhere on Earth with precise location information and contact between rescue centres and people in distress, Galileo will facilitate rescue operations and reduce the rate of false alarms. This also has implications for the fight against illegal immigration and the ability to rescue migrants in distress at sea;        a wide range of other applications        : these include logistics, the environment, science and the maintenance of public order: satellite navigation systems can also benefit the logistics sector and facilitate multimodality. Other sectors could not be covered in this Green Paper: public transport, public works and civil engineering, immigration and border control, police, monitoring of prisoners, biomass production and feedstock management, environmental management, medical applications and people with disabilities, scientific research, hunting, sports, tourism, waste disposal, etc.       Ethical and privacy issues      What impact will the development of satellite navigation systems have on privacy? The Green Paper points out that all the Member States of the European Union are signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees respect for "private and family life, home and correspondence". Directive       2002/58/EC      governs the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector.      The range of public action      The public authorities are encouraging the development of satellite navigation technologies. Measures have been taken in a number of areas including support for research and the adoption of the right regulatory framework. The areas of action are:      research and innovation;       cooperation between SMEs and the European business networks;       international cooperation;       standardisation, certification and liability;       safeguarding the radioelectrical frequency spectrum and promoting the allocation of new frequency bands;       protecting intellectual property rights;       adapting legislation to new technologies and innovation.      The Green Paper also contains a questionnaire as part of a       consultation procedure      . The replies will serve as a basis for drawing up recommendations to the Council and Parliament.

   Policy coherence for development     Policy coherence for development     Better development cooperation will not suffice to enable the developing countries to reach the Millennium goals (MDGs). This communication stresses that there is also a need for an effective improvement in the coherence of developed countries' policies.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee of 12 April 2005 - Policy Coherence for Development - Accelerating progress towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals [       COM(2005) 134      final - not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     When exploring ways to accelerate progress towards achieving Millennium Development Goals (       MDG      ), the European Union (EU) must consider how non-aid policies can assist developing countries in attaining the MDGs. The EU activity in this field is not only a key political commitment in the context of the MDGs, but also has a firm legal basis in the Treaty establishing the European Community (Article 178).     In this communication, the Commission identifies eleven priority areas, other than aid, where the challenge of attaining synergies with development policy objectives is considered particularly relevant. It has defined general guidelines for each of these priority areas, plus a number of specific measures to help speed up progress towards the MDGs.      Trade      The EU is strongly committed to ensuring a development-friendly and sustainable outcome for the       Doha Development Agenda      and the Economic Partnership Agreements with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries (ACP). The EU will further improve its Generalised System of Preferences, with a view to effectively enhancing developing countries' exports to the EU. It will continue to work towards integrating trade into development strategies and will assist developing countries in carrying out domestic reforms where necessary.      Environment      The EU will play a leading role in global efforts to curb unsustainable consumption and production patterns. It will assist developing countries in implementing the Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs), and will work to ensure that the capacities of these countries are taken into account during MEA negotiations. The EU will continue to promote pro-poor environment-related initiatives and policies, and will sharpen the focus on climate and environmental change in its own policies.      Security      The EU will treat security and development as complementary agendas, with the common aim of creating a secure environment and breaking the vicious circle of poverty, war, environmental degradation and failing economic, social and political structures. It will enhance its policies in support of good and effective governance and the prevention of conflict and state fragility, including by strengthening its response to difficult partnerships/failing states. It will strengthen the control of its arms exports, particularly to ensure that EU-manufactured weaponry is not used against civilian populations or to aggravate existing tensions or conflicts in developing countries. The EU will promote cooperation in fighting corruption, organised crime and terrorism.      Agriculture      The EU will continue its efforts to minimise the level of trade distortion related to its support measures to the agricultural sector, and facilitate developing countries' agricultural development.      Fisheries      The EU will continue to take due account of the development objectives of the countries with which the Community will sign bilateral fisheries agreements. Within the context of the new EU policy on       fisheries partnership agreements with third countries      , which has been operative since 2003, it will continue to encourage the conclusion of fisheries agreements in order to contribute towards the rational and sustainable exploitation of coastal states' surplus marine resources to the mutual benefit of both parties.      Social dimension of globalisation, promotion of employment and decent work      The EU will contribute to strengthening the social dimension of globalisation with a view to ensuring maximum benefits for all, both men and women. The global objective will be to promote decent employment conditions and work for all.      Migration      The EU will promote the synergies between migration and development, to make migration a positive factor for development.      Research and innovation      The EU will promote the integration of development objectives, where appropriate, into its research and development policies and innovation policies, and will continue to assist developing countries in enhancing their domestic capacities in this area.      Information society      The EU will address the digital divide by exploiting the potential of information and communication technologies as a development tool and as a significant resource for attaining the MDGs.      Transport      The EU will address the special needs of both landlocked and coastal developing countries by promoting the intermodality issues for achieving network interconnectivity as well as security and safety issues.      Energy      The EU is determined to contribute towards meeting the special needs of developing countries by promoting access to sustainable energy sources and by supporting interconnection of energy infrastructures and networks.      Implementation and monitoring      The Commission will look into ways and means of further reinforcing its existing instruments, notably its impact assessment tool, in order to improve the coherence of development policies.     Furthermore, it will compile a mid-term EU Report on the matter between now and the next international MDG Review, where progress on the commitments proposed in this communication will be reviewed.      Background      This communication, together with the communications on       financing for development      and on the       importance of Africa      , was part of the EU contribution to the MDG Review at the UN High Level Event in September 2005.

   White Paper on Communication     White Paper on Communication     In order to bridge the gap between the European Union and its citizens, the Commission has decided to make communication a policy in its own right. This White Paper thus aims to create a European public space, and to achieve this it puts forward five areas for action to help citizens obtain information and express their opinions.     ACT     Commission Communication of 1 February 2006, "White Paper on a European communication policy" [       COM(2006) 35      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This White Paper has made it possible to launch a broad consultation to improve communication and enhance public debate in Europe. For six months, the Institutions, EU citizens and stakeholders had the opportunity to make their contributions to European communication policy.     The Commission identified five areas for action. Specific proposals, which the consultation was intended to address, were put forward for implementation in each area. The Commission also organised a series of "stakeholder forums" which gave specific interest groups the opportunity to state their opinions on these matters. Lastly, from spring 2006, it has been publishing Eurobarometer surveys.      Defining Common Principles      The European Union's communication policy derives from several principles such as the right to information and freedom of expression, the inclusion of all citizens in public debate, diversity and participation.     To put these principles into action, the Commission is submitting the following measures for consultation:       Drawing up a European charter or code of conduct on communication:        This document will gather together the common principles on communication and ask all the stakeholders to commit to them;        Launching a web-based citizens' forum:        This forum will allow citizens to be consulted on the content of the European charter or code of conduct on communication.       Empowering Citizens      Improving civic education and connecting citizens with each other and with the public institutions: if we are to involve citizens more, these are the goals we must achieve. The European Union can provide support for Member States with regard to civic education thanks to programmes such as Leonardo da Vinci, Socrates,       Erasmus      ,       Youth in action      , or programmes in the field of       information technologies      .     In order to connect with citizens, both direct contact between citizens and the EU and indirect contact, such as Internet discussion forums, should be promoted. In fact, the Commission has designed a programme,       Citizens for Europe      , which enables EU citizens to meet and organise public debates on Europe. It also intends to take stock of existing schemes to exploit their full potential.     Lastly, to connect citizens with public institutions, European Institutions should first be made more accessible and more transparent. The European Parliament and the Council have made significant efforts in that direction. As for the Commission, it has established minimum standards for consultation, launched its own European Transparency Initiative, and intends to make a determined effort to promote multilingualism.     To keep in touch with citizens, the Commission is taking action in the following areas:      fostering the exchange of best practices with regard to civic education, developing of common educational tools, and lastly, getting European teachers who teach civic education into a network;       connecting all European libraries digitally;       setting up new meeting places for Europeans;       extending the programmes which enable citizens to visit the Institutions;       adding online forums to EU websites;       reviewing the minimum standards for consultation to ensure a more balanced representation of interest groups;       organising joint open debates during which the three main Institutions would take questions from the public.       Working with the media and new technologies      There is not enough media coverage of European issues. To improve this, the Commission would like to begin by making Europe more human. It is too often seen as faceless - it needs a clear public identity. Also, more account needs to be taken of the national, regional and local dimension. European issues should not only be addressed by specialised media - they should also be debated nationally and locally. The European Institutions should also put European policies in a local context. Lastly, the potential of new technologies needs to be exploited more fully. New technologies should not only be promoted, as they are one of the tools of cross-border democracy, they should also be made more widespread to grant everyone access.     In order to involve the media more effectively in communicating on Europe, the Commission proposes to:      devise a European communication policy that encourages the public authorities to work more with the media;       equip the EU Institutions with the best communication tools and capacities. To achieve this, Europe By Satellite should first be upgraded, but also a European programme for training in public communication should be set up to provide officials from European and national institutions with training in communication;       adapt the information provided to the media to the needs of the local populations;       draft a report on information technologies and democracy in Europe in order to better assess citizens' access to the new communication tools.       Understanding European Public Opinion      In this area, the Commission has already successfully developed tools to analyse public opinion, such as Eurobarometer surveys, and independent social research on European issues. Furthermore, the methodology for Eurobarometer surveys is being reviewed.     Additional measures could be taken to gauge European opinion:      strengthening cooperation between the European Institutions to design and plan Eurobarometer surveys and disseminate the results;       accompanying every new Eurobarometer survey with public debates;       organising polls and surveys on EU communication from spring 2006;       setting up a network of national experts on public opinion surveys;       creating an independent observatory for European public opinion.       Working Together      Creating a European public sphere requires commitment from everyone involved: the Member States, the EU Institutions, local and regional authorities, political parties and, lastly, the civil society organisations. For the benefit of all of these, the Commission is putting forward a series of actions to enable them to participate more in communication about Europe:       increasing cooperation between the national and European levels:        the vehicles of cooperation could be either financial or operational, such as making available the European information networks and relays. Meetings between national ministers and European Commissioners will be built up. Lastly, Member States could organise public and parliamentary discussions on the Commission's annual strategic priorities;        increasing cooperation among national authorities dealing with public communication        with a view to developing joint initiatives and sharing best practices;        communicating more about the EU's role in the world:        this is an effective way to involve the citizens of Europe themselves. To achieve it, more resources need to be allocated to diplomacy;        increasing cooperation between the EU Institutions with regard to informing citizens        , for example by improving the organisation of the InterInstitutional Group on Information;        having the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions        increase their efforts to organise regional and local discussion of European issues;        encouraging political parties to become more involved in European political issues;         encouraging civil society organisations to devise targeted cooperation projects in the field of public communication.        Organisation of the consultation      The consultation process on this White Paper is planned to last six months, from February until July 2006     At the end of this consultation, working groups comprising representatives of the Commission and of its partners have been set up for each of the areas for action identified. They have been asked to produce concrete proposals for action. The Commission has outlined a number of measures in this       Communication      to improve the way the EU informs and listens to the public. They are the result of the extensive White Paper consultation, launched in February 2006, which has since then prompted hundreds of responses.

   The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia – Agriculture, fisheries and food safety     The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia – Agriculture, fisheries and food safety     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM(2011) 666      final - SEC(2011) 1203 - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was granted candidate country status for European Union (EU) membership in 2005. The Accession Partnership, adopted by the Council in 2008, supports the country’s preparations in view of its future membership and the alignment of its legislation with the Community       acquis      . In 2008, the accession negotiations had not yet been opened, as some progress still needed to be made on the objectives and conditions set out in the partnership.     The       2011 Report      notes progress made with regard to alignment with the       acquis      , although the administrative capacities are not yet fully operational. Furthermore, the report notes satisfactory progress on food security matters.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission’s words)      The       agriculture      chapter covers a large number of binding rules, many of which are directly applicable. The proper application of these rules and their effective enforcement by an efficient public administration are essential for the functioning of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The CAP includes the setting-up of management and control systems such as a paying agency and the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS), and also the capacity to implement rural development measures. EU accession requires integration into the common market organisations for a range of agricultural products, including arable crops, sugar, animal products and specialised crops. Member States must also be able to apply EU legislation on direct aid for farmers and to manage the common market organisations for various agricultural products.     The       fisheries       acquis      consists of regulations, which do not need to be transposed into national legislation. However, it requires the introduction of measures to prepare the administration and operators for participation in the Common Fisheries Policy (in the areas of market policy, resource and fleet management, inspection and control, structural actions and State aid). In some cases, existing fisheries agreements or conventions with third countries or international organisations need to be adapted.     This chapter covers detailed rules in the area of       food safety      . The general foodstuffs policy sets hygiene rules for foodstuff production. Furthermore, the       acquis      provides detailed rules in the veterinary field, which are essential for safeguarding animal health, animal welfare and safety of food of animal origin in the internal market. In the phytosanitary field, EU rules cover issues such as quality of seed, plant protection material, harmful organisms and animal nutrition.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      Further progress was achieved in the field of       agriculture and rural development      . Key support policies for agricultural and rural development are gradually being aligned with EU requirements. Alignment with the       acquis      requires continuing sustained efforts. Administrative capacity remains a concern throughout the sector.     There was good progress in the area of       food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy      , in particular with respect to the adoption of new framework legislation. Administrative capacity of the Food and Veterinary Agency remains however insufficient to ensure proper implementation of the       acquis.

In its 2010 Report, the Commission noted the country’s progress towards alignment in the field of agricultural policy and rural development. Similarly, the country had also made progress on food security matters. Strengthening administrative capacity in these two areas remains essential. Furthermore, preparations have begun on the implementation of the Fisheries policy.

In its November 2008 report, the Commission notes that considerable efforts are required by the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) to align its agricultural legislation with EU legislation. There has been progress in the field of agriculture and on rural development. In the field of food safety, the administrative capacity has been strengthened in terms of both the number and competence of staff. Preparations for implementation of the common fisheries policy are at an early stage.

   Strategy for a secure information society (2006 communication)     Strategy for a secure information society (2006 communication)     The purpose of this Communication is to revitalise European policy on network and information security by identifying current challenges and proposing measures to tackle them. The strategy proposed by the Commission involves all relevant stakeholders and is based on dialogue, partnership and empowerment.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 31 May 2006: A strategy for a Secure Information Society - "Dialogue, partnership and empowerment" [       COM(2006) 251      final - not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Community action: overview     Up to now, the European Commission has tackled security issues in the Information Society by adopting a three-pronged approach embracing:      specific network and information security measures;       the         regulatory framework for electronic communications        and, in particular, the Directive on         privacy and electronic communications        ;       the         fight against cybercrime        .      Community measures in this area also include:      European programmes devoted to research and development - the 7th         Framework Programme        will help reinforce security-related research by establishing a European Security Research Programme;       the         Safer Internet        programme, which promotes safer Internet usage and aims to protect end-users against undesirable content.       involvement in international forums addressing these topics, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the Council of Europe and the United Nations. At the world summit on the Information Society, held in Tunis in November 2005, the European Union (EU) strongly supported the discussions on the availability, reliability and security of networks and information.      In 2004, the Community established the       European Network and Information Security Agency      (ENISA). ENISA's mission is to help increase network and information security within the Community and to promote the emergence of a culture of network and information security for the benefit of citizens, consumers, businesses and public sector organisations.     These measures and initiatives are to a large extent interdependent and involve many different stakeholders, and so a coordinated strategy is called for. This Communication sets out such a strategy for developing a coherent, holistic approach to network and information security.      KEY CHALLENGES      Despite the efforts already made, security continues to pose challenges to public bodies, businesses and private users alike. The risks are often underestimated even though the relevance of information and communication technologies (ICT) for the European economy and European society as a whole is undeniable. Furthermore, other critical infrastructures are also becoming more and more dependent on the integrity of their respective information systems.      Attacks on information systems      Attacks on information systems are increasingly motivated by financial profit. Personal data are illegally mined without the user's knowledge, while the number of malware variants is increasing rapidly, as is the rate at which they are evolving. For example, spam is now used as a vehicle for spreading viruses and spyware.      Use of mobile devices      The increasing deployment of mobile devices (including 3G mobile phones, portable videogame consoles, etc.) and mobile-based network services poses new threats to security. These threats could turn out to be more dangerous than attacks on PCs as the latter already have a significant level of security.      Advent of "ambient intelligence"      Another significant development in the Information Society is the advent of "ambient intelligence", where intelligent devices supported by computing and network technology will become a ubiquitous part of everyday life in the near future. This development brings with it many opportunities, but it will also create additional security and privacy-related risks.      Raising awareness of users      In order to successfully tackle the problem of underestimating the risks, all stakeholders need reliable data on security incidents and trends.     At the same time, it is important that awareness programmes designed to highlight security threats do not undermine the trust and confidence of consumers and users by focusing only on the negative aspects of security. Network and information security should be presented as a virtue and an opportunity rather than as a liability and a cost.      THE PROPOSED APPROACH      In order to tackle the challenges presented by network and information security, the Commission proposes an approach which is based on dialogue, partnership and empowerment.      Dialogue      The Commission proposes a series of measures designed to establish an open, inclusive and multi-stakeholder dialogue:      benchmarking exercise for national policies relating to network and information security. This should help identify the most effective practices so that they can then be deployed on a broader basis throughout the EU. In particular, this exercise will identify best practices to improve awareness among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and citizens of the risks and challenges associated with network and information security;       a structured multi-stakeholder debate on how best to exploit existing regulatory instruments. This debate will be organised within the context of conferences and seminars.       Partnership      Effective policy making requires a clear understanding of the nature of the challenges to be tackled. This calls for reliable, up-to-date statistical and economic data. Accordingly, the Commission will ask ENISA      to build up a partnership of trust with Member States and stakeholders in order to develop an appropriate framework for collecting data;       to examine the feasibility of a European information sharing and alert system to facilitate effective responses to threats. This system would include a multilingual European portal to provide tailored information on threats, risks and alerts.      In parallel, the Commission will invite Member States, the private sector and the research community to establish a partnership to ensure the availability of data pertaining to the ICT security industry.      Empowerment      The empowerment of stakeholders is a prerequisite for fostering their awareness of security needs and risks, thus promoting network and information security.     For this reason, Member States are invited to      proactively participate in the proposed benchmarking exercise for national policies;       promote, in cooperation with ENISA, awareness campaigns on the benefits of adopting effective security technologies, practices and behaviour;       leverage the roll-out of e-government services to promote good security practices;       stimulate the development of network and information security programmes as part of higher-education curricula.      Private sector stakeholders are also encouraged to take initiatives to      define responsibilities for software producers and Internet service providers in relation to the provision of adequate and auditable levels of security;       promote diversity, openness, interoperability, usability and competition as key drivers for security, and to stimulate the deployment of security-enhancing products and services to combat ID theft and other privacy-intrusive attacks;       disseminate good security practices for network operators, service providers and SMEs;       promote training programmes in the private sector to provide employees with the knowledge and skills necessary to implement security practices;       work towards affordable security certification schemes for products, processes and services that will address EU-specific needs;       involve the insurance sector in developing risk management tools and methods.       COMPLEMENTARY INITIATIVES      The Commission will complement this approach with other initiatives by      adopting a Communication on the way in which spam and other threats, such as spyware, is evolving;       making proposals for improving cooperation between law enforcement authorities and for addressing new forms of criminal activity - this issue will be the subject of a Communication dealing specifically with cybercrime;       creating an action plan to achieve the objectives of the Commission's Green Paper on the European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection;       conducting a review of the         regulatory framework for electronic communications in 2006        .       Background      This Communication follows on from the "       i2010- A European Information Society for growth and jobs      " initiative, which aims to boost the e-economy in Europe. The i2010 initiative highlights the importance of network and information security for the creation of a single European information space.

   Partnership for the accession of the Czech Republic     Partnership for the accession of the Czech Republic     The aim of the Accession Partnership is to assist the authorities in the candidate country in their efforts to comply with the accession criteria. It covers in detail the priorities for accession preparations, in particular implementing the acquis, and forms the basis for programming pre-accession assistance from Community funds such as the Phare programme. Following the signing of the Accession Treaty on 16 April 2003 and the official integration of the country into the European Union on 1 May 2004, the accession partnership has come to an end.     In its communication "       Agenda 2000      ", the European Commission has set out a range of proposals for strengthening the pre-accession strategy for all the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The general objective of this strategy is to offer a coherent programme for preparing these countries for membership of the European Union, and more particularly:      to bring together the various forms of aid offered by the European Union within a single framework, the accession partnerships,       to familiarise applicants with the European Union's procedures and policies by offering them the opportunity to participate in Community programmes.      1) OBJECTIVE     The objective of the accession partnership (adopted in March 1998 and amended in December 1999 and in January 2002) is to register by law the working priorities defined in the Commission's Opinion on the Czech Republic's application for membership, the financial resources available to help the Czech Republic implement these priorities and the conditions which apply to this aid. The accession partnership defines a framework for a range of policy instruments to support candidate countries as they prepare for membership.     These include a national programme for the adoption of the Community acquis (NPAA), joint evaluation of medium term economic policy priorities, the pact against organised crime, the national development plan and other sectoral programmes for participation in structural funds after accession and implementation of the       ISPA      and       SAPARD      before accession. In 2002, the partnership for accession served as the starting point for preparing an action plan to reinforce the administrative and judicial capacity of the Czech Republic.     These instruments do not form an integral part of the partnership but their priorities are compatible.     The implementation of the partnership for accession will be monitored under the Europe Agreement between the European Union and the Czech Republic.     2) PRIORITIES     These are divided into two groups: short and medium term. Priorities in the first group are those that the Czech Republic was likely to settle or make progress on during the year 2000. The priorities in the second group should be settled by the end of 2003.     The Czech Republic has partly achieved the economic and political criteria priorities. It has totally or largely achieved the priorities linked to the free movement of persons, the free movement of capital, economic and monetary union, statistics, social affairs and employment, energy, culture and audiovisual policy, the environment, consumer protection and health, cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs and financial control. Most of the other priorities have been partly achieved.     In December 1999 the accession partnership priorities were revised (see page 3 of Annex to Decision       1999/858/EC)      . In November 2000, these priorities were revised for the second time. A final revision was published in 2002 (Decision 2002/85/EC). This forms the basis of the Commission's evaluation in its 2002 report.     Priority areas are now:     (for up-to-date information on this subject, please refer to the Adoption of the Community acquis section)       Economic reform         Institutional and administrative capacity building         Internal market         Justice and home affairs         Environment         Political criteria         Economic policy         Agriculture         Transport         Employment and social affairs         Regional policy and cohesion       3) FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK      Phare      A national allocation of EUR 59 million was provided under the       Phare 2000 programme      for the Czech Republic. An additional EUR 10 million were allocated to a cross-border cooperation programme with Germany. A further EUR 5 million were earmarked for cooperation with Austria and EUR 5 million for cooperation with Poland. The Phare programme provided EUR 722.5 million to the Czech Republic during the course of the period 1999-2000. Phare 2001 provided EUR 65.4 million. A further EUR 19 million were to be used for cross-border cooperation with Germany (EUR 10 million), Poland (EUR 5 million) and Austria (EUR 4 million). Phare 2002 allocated EUR 60 million plus an envelope of EUR 24.8 million under the additional facility to reinforce the country's institutions. Further aid was agreed for cross-border cooperation with Germany (EUR 10 million), Austria (EUR 4 million) and Poland (EUR 5 million).     The Czech authorities are responsible for contracts and payments linked to the aid. Nonetheless, the financial regulation of the European Communities requires the Commission to oversee the award of contracts and approve any contract financed by Phare and signed by the partner country before it comes into effect.      Pre-accession aid      From this year financial aid will include aid for agriculture and rural development       (SAPARD)      and a structural instrument       (ISPA)      giving priority to measures in the transport and environment sectors. The regulation coordinating Phare aid, SAPARD and ISPA adopted in June 1999 enables the Commission to carry out a posteriori monitoring of contracts if it considers financial control by the partner country to be inadequate.     During the period 2000-2002 the total amount of financial aid made available each year was EUR 79 million for Phare, EUR 22.1 million for SAPARD and between EUR 55 and 80 million for ISPA. SAPARD 2002 allocated EUR 23.1 million to the Czech Republic. The ISPA envelope for 2002 was between EUR 59.9 and 87.1 million.     4) REFERENCES      Decision         98/267/EC        of 30.3.1998Official Journal L 121 of 23.4.1998       Decision         1999/858/EC        of 06.12.1999Official Journal L 335 of 28.12.1999       Commission Opinion COM(97) 2009 finalNot published in the Official Journal       Commission Report COM(98)708 finalNot published in the Official Journal       Commission Report COM(1999)503 finalNot published in the Official Journal       Commission Report COM(2000)703 finalNot published in the Official Journal       Commission Report COM(2001)700 final - SEC(2001)1746Not published in the Official Journal       Decision 2002/85/EC of 28.01.2002Official Journal L 44 of 14.02.2002       Commission Report COM(2002) 700 final - SEC(2002) 1402Not published in the Official Journal       Treaty of Accession to the European Union [Official Journal L 236, 23.09.2003]      Last updated: 19.11.2004  
   Online gambling (Green Paper)     Online gambling (Green Paper)     In 2008, gambling revenues reached EUR 75.9 billion. Online gambling is the fastest-growing gaming sector. This growth, and that of the Internet, makes monitoring these cross-border services difficult. National legal frameworks vary enormously from one EU country to another, imposing different rules for licensing, related online services, payments, public interest objectives, and the fight against fraud. The Commission therefore decided to launch a consultation to identify common practices which would facilitate the provision of cross-border services. The aim is to achieve a regulated internal market for online gambling.     ACT     European Commission Green Paper of 24 March 2011, on on-line gambling in the Internal Market [       COM(2011) 128      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This Green Paper aims to launch a debate on the development of online gambling in the European Union (EU). There are currently two national models applied in this sector, namely:      a strictly regulated framework within which licensed operators provide services;       a strictly controlled monopoly.      However, the development of extensive illegal or “black” online markets (markets consisting of unlicensed operators) or “grey” markets poses a number of challenges. It is for this reason that the European Commission wishes to consult the various stakeholders in order to better frame the development of such activities at cooperative or cross-border levels.      Definition and current legislation      Gambling falls under Article 56 of the       Treaty on the Functioning of the EU      (TFEU) and is governed by service provision rules. The terms covers a wide range of service activities which individuals can access directly by electronic means, such as:      online sports betting;       casino games;       media games;       promotional games;       gambling services operated by and for the benefit of recognised charities and non-profit making organisations;       lottery services.      The Internet and other technological platforms (i.e. mobile telephones) are used in online gaming:      to offer gambling services to consumers;       to allow consumers to bet or gamble against each other (betting exchanges or online poker);       as a distribution technique (e.g. lottery tickets).       Communication techniques used by providers of online gaming services for promotion and supply      The main communication techniques used to promote online services are:      TV advertising;       printed press advertising;       online commercial communications;       sales promotions (e.g. premium offers);       direct marketing;       sponsorship agreements;       online banners and pop-ups on non-gambling sites.       Payment services and pay-outs      Generally, operators require customers to deposit funds on player accounts before playing by using:      credit cards;       e-Wallets;       bank transfers;       pre-paid cards;       cash transfers.       Customer identification      Customer identification is necessary for the protection of minors, the prevention of money laundering and fraud, and “know-your-customer” controls. However, the absence of mutual recognition of identification services across the EU raises difficulties.      Public interest objectives      The Commission identifies three public interest objectives which may be valid for Member States in defining their national online gambling policies:       consumer protection        : this involves protecting gamblers against fraudulent services, particularly gamblers suffering from addiction. Member States already have available a number of instruments such as age limits, bans on the use of credit or restrictions on certain forms of games. The Commission proposes to discuss the effectiveness of such instruments in protecting consumers;        public order        : Member States should seek to prevent fraud and unfair games, as well as money laundering. The Commission notes the application of certain types of measures such as customer due diligence, payment controls and operational controls in combating these practices;        financing of public interest activities        : methods for channelling gambling revenues vary considerably from one Member State to another. The Commission wishes to examine more closely systems of revenue returns to event organisers, and the risks of “free-riding” revenue channelling schemes through the provision of online gambling services.       Payment blocking and liability regimes      Member States have a wide range of practices to manage the licensing, regulation and monitoring of online gaming. Through this Green Paper, the Commission wishes to analyse the actual role of regulatory bodies in the Member States.     Gambling authorities could cooperate with national and European stakeholders. The Commission wishes to strengthen this type of cooperation.     In some Member States, there are blocking schemes to limit illicit and cross-border online gambling services by:      Domain Name System (DNS) filtering;       Internet Protocol (IP) blocking;       Payment blocking, based on the operators’ Merchant Category Code (MCC).      The Commission intends to develop tools to foster this type of procedure at cross-border level, as well as other practices.

act   Commission Recommendation  2014/135/EU  of 12 March 2014 on a new approach to business failure and insolvency.   summary   European attitudes to business insolvency are in flux, with reforms to existing European Union law on cross-border  insolvencies  already under way. This new European Commission recommendation, however, aims to provide a common  framework for national insolvency rules  .  The  framework  would allow debtors to do the following.   Restructure as soon as likely insolvency becomes apparent.   Keep  control over the day-to-day operation  of their business.   Request a  temporary stay of enforcement actions  lodged by creditors if such actions would hamper the prospects of a restructuring plan. The length of the stay should depend on the complexity of the anticipated restructuring and be granted for no more than 4 months initially and for no more than 12 months in total.   Seek court confirmation of a restructuring plan which affects the interests of dissenting creditors. Creditors would be bound by any court-confirmed plan. The recommendation lists the contents of  restructuring plans and the requirements for court confirmation  .    More easily obtain new financing  for a restructuring plan as court confirmed new financing would be exempt from avoidance actions.   The  restructuring procedure  aims to be rapid, to not be costly and to allow for as many steps as possible to be taken out of court. A  mediator  or supervisor may be appointed to assist negotiations between the debtor and creditors.   Second chance   Compelling evidence that honest entrepreneurs who get a second chance following bankruptcy are more successful in their next venture has convinced the Commission to recommend allowing entrepreneurs  a fresh start  after bankruptcy.  Entrepreneurs would be  fully discharged of their debtswithin 3 years  of a court decision to open bankruptcy proceedings or the start date of any repayment plan.  Nevertheless, the recommendation recognises that  full discharge is not always appropriate  and EU countries may introduce more stringent laws to discourage dishonest entrepreneurs or those who do not respect their legal obligations to their creditors.  National laws to  safeguard the livelihood of the entrepreneur and his/her family  by allowing the entrepreneur to keep certain assets would also be permitted.

   Turkey – Employment and social policy     Turkey – Employment and social policy     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM (2011) 666      final – SEC(2011) 1201 – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The       2011 Report      notes limited progress in the area of employment and social policy. Although constitutional changes have been made, the granting of full trade union rights is still not guaranteed. Undeclared work and that of women remain a source for concern.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission’s words)      The       acquis      in the social field includes minimum standards in areas such as labour law, equal treatment of women and men, health and safety at work and anti-discrimination. The European Social Fund (ESF) is the main financial tool through which the EU supports the implementation of its Employment Strategy and contributes to social inclusion efforts in the fight against social exclusion (implementation rules are covered under Chapter 22, which deals with all structural instruments). The Member States participate in social dialogue at European level and in EU policy processes in the areas of employment policy, social inclusion and social protection.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      Turkey made limited progress in the field of       social policy and employment      . Administrative capacity showed some improvement. Constitutional amendments regarding trade union rights have not resulted in further changes of the legislation aimed at granting full trade union rights in line with EU standards and ILO conventions. The reduction of large-scale undeclared work and the increase of female employment rates are still matters of concern. The scope of the labour law remains limited. Enforcement of health and safety at work legislation needs to be stepped up. The risk of poverty remains very high, especially for the rural population and for children. Legislation establishing an equality body has not yet been adopted.     RELATED ACTS      Commission Report [         COM(2010) 660        final – SEC(2010) 1327 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2010 Report highlighted the progress made by Turkey in the field of social policy and employment. However, alignment with the European social       acquis      remained limited. Reforms needed to continue in the areas of health and safety at work, trade union law and the fight against poverty.      Commission Report [         COM(2009) 533        final – SEC(2009) 1334 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2009 Report noted limited progress. The legislation on labour law, discrimination, health and safety at work had not yet been aligned with European standards. However, there had been good progress on the preparations for the introduction of the European Social Fund in the country. The establishment of the Parliamentary Commission on Equal Opportunities for Men and Women also constituted progress. The country had to take appropriate action to reduce unemployment and to combat poverty.      Commission Report [         COM(2008) 674        final – SEC(2008) 2699 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2008 Report noted that Turkey still needed to make progress despite the adoption of a package of political measures in employment, social protection law and a social security system. The Joint Assessment Paper on priorities in employment and the Joint Inclusion Memorandum on inclusion were still to be finalized.      Commission Report [         COM(2007) 663        final – SEC(2007) 1436 – Not published in the Official Journal].

The 2005 Report noted changes in the fields of labour law and health and safety at work. The Turkish authorities had started working on the Joint Assessment Paper of Employment Policy Priorities (JAP) and the Joint Inclusion Memorandum (JIM) to combat social exclusion. The administrative capacity of the Ministry of Labour had also been strengthened.      Commission Report [         COM(2004) 656        final – SEC(2004) 1201 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2004 Report noted that the process of alignment was still incomplete. Progress was needed to improve the health of the population and to make promoting social inclusion a priority.      Commission Report [         COM(2003) 676        final – SEC(2003) 1212 – Not published in Official Journal].      The 2003 Report emphasised that, although the process of alignment on Community law had begun, particularly labour law, a great deal nevertheless remained to be done on social dialogue, social protection, promoting social inclusion and public health.

   Mortgage Credit in the EU (Green Paper)     Mortgage Credit in the EU (Green Paper)     Mortgage credit markets vary greatly between the different Member States, with the same being true for consumer protection in this field. In a Green Paper (initiatives to be discussed), the Commission proposes intervening on this market to promote a cross-border mortgage credit. It proposes among other things establishing minimum rules for the information that needs to be provided for this type of loan and the creation of a Euromortgage.     ACT     Green Paper: mortgage credit in the European Union [       COM(2005) 327      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     It is argued in the Green Paper that the establishment of a transnational mortgage credit market in place of the numerous existing markets could contribute to European growth. A transnational market would benefit the consumer by promoting competition and increasing the choice of mortgage credit, while at the same time encouraging labour mobility. For the time being, national laws make it impossible for a transnational credit market to be established.     The Commission has launched a debate on the possible measures to be taken and the desired degree of Community intervention to bring about better integration of this market. It could eliminate obstacles to the supply of and demand for mortgage credits, and increase product diversity and price convergence. This would be beneficial both for the consumer and for economic development.     Moreover, the market is one of the largest in Europe and is continuing to grow. By way of example, the Green Paper states that by the end of 2004 Europe's mortgage credit markets will represent approximately 40% of European GDP.      Advantages of a possible Community intervention      An intervention by the Commission could ensure:      an overall decrease in the cost of mortgage loans;       a broader range of ancillary products (mortgage insurance etc.) and key mortgage products (such as more flexible mortgages) being offered;       a decreased credit risk thanks to cross-border diversification;       greater consumer protection.      The Commission has also launched a debate into the possibility of intervening, to varying degrees, in the following areas:      the information provided to consumers;       early repayment penalties;       the method for calculating the annual percentage rate (APR) applied to mortgage loans, making it easier for consumers to compare prices;       ceilings on interest and variation in interest rates;       the standardisation of loan contracts;       cross-border extra-judicial measures;       the customer's creditworthiness and access to databases;       property valuation;       compulsory auction procedures;       the possible creation of a Euromortgage, an instrument that would make it easier to take out and transfer a mortgage.       Greater protection for consumers      Consumers should receive all the information necessary to make a free choice. For the time being, a voluntary code of conduct is in place concerning the information made available on housing loans prior to the signing of the contract.     The Commission is reflecting on the future of this code, and wonders whether it would be better for the code of conduct to be made compulsory and whether the obligation to provide information that apply to the lender should also apply to other service providers such as brokers.

   European Consumer Consultative Group     European Consumer Consultative Group     The European Consumer Consultative Group can be consulted by the Commission on any problem associated with protecting the interests of consumers in the European Union (EU). Comprising one member representing the National consumer organisation of each Member State and one member from each European consumer organisation, it replaces the Consumers' Committee.     ACT     Commission Decision       2003/709/EC      of 9 October 2003 setting up a European Consumer Consultative Group.     SUMMARY     The European Consumer Consultative Group represents European Union consumers (including those of the accession countries once they have joined the EU). The Commission can seek its opinion on problems affecting consumers at Community level.      Composition      It comprises:      one member representing the National consumer organisation of each Member State and       one member from each European consumer organisation.      One of the innovative elements of this Decision compared to previous ones is that it harmonises the definition of European consumer organisations with those in other legal acts (see Article 2).     This Decision also makes it possible for the Group to officially involve other organisations which promote consumer interests and experts in its work.      Duration      The members of the Group have a three-year mandate. The new Decision introduces a limit for the renewal of the mandate of members representing the national organisations to only one renewal (previously, there was no limit).      Operation      The European Consumer Consultative Group normally meets four times a year. The Commission consults it whenever necessary, often by 'written procedure', sometimes via working parties. It plays a vital role in the exchange of information between the Commission and the consumer organisations on the ground. The Commission chairs and organises its work and provides secretarial support.     Each year, the Group presents an activity report at the assembly of consumer organisations organised annually by the Commission.      Context      Decision       2003/709/EC      repealed Commission Decision       2000/323/EC      of 4 May 2000, mainly in order to harmonise the definition of consumer organisations, bearing in mind that the number of members of the Group will be increasing from 2004 with the accession to the EU of ten new Member States.     The repealed Decision       2000/323/EC      had permitted an increase in the number of members by removing the limit of 20. The previous Decision had provided for the participation of a member from each European consumer organisation (5 at the time) plus one representative from each Member State (15 representatives).

summary of   Regulation (EU) No 258/2014 establishing an EU programme supporting specific activities in the field of financial reporting and auditing for the 2014-2020 period   what is the aim of the regulation  It sets up an EU programme to support the activities of bodies which contribute to the achievement of the EU’s policy objectives in relation to financial reporting and auditing.   key points   The regulation covers the period from 2014 to 2020 and sets out rules for the allocation of an initial amount of €43.18 million from the EU’s budget to help  develop international financial reporting and auditing standards  . Regulation (EU)  2017/827  amended the original regulation increasing the total financial allocation for the programme to  €57.007 million  .  Following the economic and financial crisis of 2008, it became clear that the issue of financial reporting and auditing needed to be addressed and it became central to the EU’s political agenda. Well-functioning common financial reporting rules are essential for:   the EU’s internal market;   the effective functioning of the capital markets; and   the achievement of an integrated market for financial services in the EU.   The programme was designed to contribute to the objectives of:   ensuring  comparability and transparency  of company accounts throughout the EU;   ensuring the  global harmonisation of financial reporting standards  by promoting the international acceptance of  International Financial Reporting Standards  ;    promoting convergence and high-quality international standards  for auditing in all EU countries.   The programme covers:   the activities of developing or providing input to the  development of standards  ;   activities relating to applying, assessing or  monitoring standards or overseeing standard-setting processes  in support of the implementation of EU policies in the field of financial reporting and auditing.   The  beneficiaries  are:   in the area of  financial reporting  :   the  European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG)  (€23.134 million)   the  International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation  (€31.632 million);     in the area of auditing:   the  Public Interest Oversight Board (PIOB)  (€2.241 million).     from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 1 January 2014.   background   In 2009, the EU launched a programme to support activities in the fields of financial reporting and auditing. The beneficiaries were the IFRS Foundation, EFRAG and the PIOB. The programme was extended in 2014 for the period 2014-2020 for IFRS Foundation and the PIOB but, for EFRAG, the European Parliament and the Council decided to wait until certain reforms were made to EFRAG’s governance. These governance reforms were implemented in October 2014 thus paving the way for the EU to increase its contribution to EFRAG.
act   Directive  2006/87/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 laying down technical requirements for inland waterway vessels and repealing Council Directive  82/714/EEC  .   summary   The coexistence of various technical regulations on navigable waterways in the Community has long obstructed the free movement of vessels.  This Directive is designed to strengthen the harmonisation of the requirements for issuing navigation certificates by the Member States.   Scope of application   The Directive applies to vessels of a length of 20 metres or more and a volume of at least 100 m3. It also applies to floating equipment, tugs and pushers, and vessels intended for passenger transport carrying more than 12 passengers in addition to the crew. Ferries, naval vessels and warships are excluded from its scope of application.   Waterways   The Community waterways concerned are classified in four navigable zones plus a zone R – the Rhine – which is covered by a special convention. Any Member State may change the classification of its waterways, subject to their being notified to the Commission at least six months in advance.   Derogations   Exceptions are allowed: any Member State may, after consulting the Commission, authorise a reduction of the technical requirements of Annex II for craft operating exclusively in certain zones.  Derogations are also possible in the case of vessels operating on waterways not linked to the waterways of another Member State or making limited journeys of local interest or in harbour areas. However, the Member States may also, under certain conditions, lay down additional technical requirements for vessels operating on their waterways.   Certificates   Craft operating on Community waterways must also carry a Community certificate. Where they operate in zone R, they must have either a Community certificate or a certificate issued in accordance with the Revised Convention for Rhine Navigation. Community certificates are to be issued for craft laid down from 30 December 2008 onwards, following a technical inspection carried out prior to the craft being put into service and intended to check whether it complies with the technical requirements laid down in Annex II to the Directive. If the competent authorities find any infringements of the requirements, the craft may, provided that it does not constitute a manifest danger, continue to operate until such time as the non-compliant components or areas of the craft are replaced or altered. After that, the components or areas must meet the requirements of Annex II.  Community certificates may be issued by the competent authorities of any Member State. It must draw up a list of its competent authorities and notify them to the Commission.   Implementing powers   Directive 2006/137/EC adapts Directive  2006/87/EC  to bring it into line with Council Decision  1999/468/EC  laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission. Directive 2006/87/EC empowers the Commission to update the technical requirements in the Annexes to Directive 2006/87/EC.   Transport of dangerous goods   Directive  2008/68/EC  repeals Article 6 of Directive 2006/87/EC on the transport of dangerous goods, and establishes common rules for all aspects of inland transport, including inland navigation.

   Aviation safety: Occurrence reporting in civil aviation     Aviation safety: Occurrence reporting in civil aviation     This directive sets out to improve aviation safety by ensuring that safety-critical information is reported, collected, stored, protected and disseminated in order to facilitate its effective analysis and follow-up, with a view to preventing future accidents and incidents.     ACT     Directive      2003/42/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2003 on occurrence reporting in civil aviation [      See amending act      ].     SUMMARY     The accident rate in civil aviation has remained fairly constant over the last ten years. However, the increase in air traffic could lead to an increase in the number of accidents in the near future. To enhance the safety of civil aviation, better knowledge of occurrences is required in order to facilitate analysis and prevent accidents.     The directive covers occurrences (accidents, incidents and serious incidents) that endanger or which, if not corrected, would endanger an aircraft, its occupants or any other person.     Occurrence reports must be collected, evaluated, processed and stored in a database. European Union (EU) countries must entrust this task to a competent authority, which may be the national civil aviation authority, the investigating body established under Directive       94/56/EC      or any other independent body or entity entrusted with this function.     EU countries must participate in a mutual exchange of information by making all the information stored in their databases available to the competent authorities of the other and the Commission. To facilitate this exchange, the Commission must provide them with software enabling them to establish the appropriate interconnections.     Information gathered from mandatory reporting will be disseminated with a view to improving safety. It may therefore be consulted by each national civil aviation authority and by civil aviation accident investigation entities. Other interested parties may also receive information for their own use, information which may be restricted to what is strictly necessary. The public, too, will be informed of the level of aviation safety by the publication of an annual safety review and, if necessary, by extracts from disidentified reports (from which all personal details concerning the reporter and the technical aspects have been removed).     The information exchanged and disseminated is confidential and may be used solely for the purpose of the activities of participants and addressees. Reporters and the information they supply are protected in order to guarantee free and confident reporting.     In addition to the system of mandatory reporting, EU countries may put in place a system of voluntary reporting to collect and analyse information on observed deficiencies in aviation which do not have to be reported under the system of mandatory reporting, but which are perceived by the reporter as an actual or potential hazard.     The Commission is assisted in the implementation of the directive by the committee set up by Article 12 of       Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91      on the harmonisation of technical requirements and administrative procedures in the field of civil aviation.

RELATED ACTS      Commission Regulation (EC) No         1321/2007        of 12 November 2007 laying down implementing rules for the integration into a central repository of information on civil aviation occurrences exchanged in accordance with Directive         2003/42/EC        of the European Parliament and of the Council.      The most efficient way of exchanging information on civil aviation safety is to create a central repository fed by national databases and accessible to all EU countries. The regulation lays down measures for creating the repository and determines which entities should be given right of access to it.     Last updated: 07.07.2011  
   Preparing the future Member States to implement the regional policy in the period 2004-2006     Preparing the future Member States to implement the regional policy in the period 2004-2006     1) OBJECTIVE     To assess the progress of the measures taken by the future Member States to manage the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund in the period 2004-2006.     2) ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council of 16 July 2003 on the implementation of the commitments undertaken by the acceding countries in the context of accession negotiations on Chapter 21 - regional policy and coordination of structural instruments [       COM(2003) 433      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     3) SUMMARY     During the final accession negotiations with the future Member States, the European Council held in Copenhagen in December 2002 decided to grant the ten countries concerned an overall budget of EUR 21.7 billion for cohesion policy in the period 2004-2006. This amount significantly increases the assistance available to these countries through the pre-accession financial instruments (the       Phare      ,       ISPA      and       SAPARD      programmes).     Although their accession is not until 1 May 2004, the future Member States will be eligible for the Structural Funds from 1 January 2004. They must therefore meet the following challenges before the end of 2003:      adopt the necessary legislative provisions for transposing the Community acquis on regional policy;       introduce administrative structures ensuring the implementation, monitoring and control of the regional development programmes.      The Commission has warned that it cannot approve Community funding until the rules governing the       Structural Funds      and the       Cohesion Fund      are adopted and complied with.     In accordance with its commitment in this regard, the Commission has published a report on the readiness of the future Member States, based on detailed questionnaires addressed to them. Ten essential points need to be urgently resolved:      The delay in harmonising and implementing the rules on public procurement, state aids, the environment and equal opportunities is worrying.Technical assistance should be used to further strengthen the capacity of the national administrations. Notification of state aid schemes to the Commission must be speeded up. It is necessary to apply the provisions on environmental impact assessment, nature protection and waste management.       The future Member States must improve inter-ministerial coordination.A full definition of the respective roles of the managing bodies and the intermediate bodies is required. The independence of the certifying role of the paying authority needs to be clarified.       Shortcomings have been found in financial management and control.A better division of tasks between the management and control bodies is needed. The distinction between the management controls under the responsibility of the managing authority and the independent random sampling controls has to be clarified. Significant work must be done on defining the monitoring indicators and establishing a computerised system to collect and exchange data.       Not all the future Member States have yet established adequate accounting systems.       The recruitment of additional staff to manage the Structural Funds is behind schedule, particularly in the intermediate bodies and regional administrations.       The negotiations on the regional development programmes must be completed between now and the end of 2003.Achieving this would enable assistance to begin in January 2004. The future Member States have adopted a simplified programming approach involving a reduced number of operational programmes, priorities and measures, given the short period involved (2 years). Nevertheless, the programmes submitted do not follow a coherent strategy.       There are not enough planned measures in the project pipeline.The actions planned will not allow the increase in available funding from 2004 to be fully drawn down. Priority should be given to technical assistance measures.       Detailed planning of the national matching contribution for the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund must form part of project preparation.       A great effort must be made to ensure implementation of the partnership principle.       There are significant delays in introducing monitoring systems.      In November 2003, i.e. six months before accession, the Commission will publish a detailed monitoring report on the extent to which the ten future Member States have fulfilled their commitments in areas governed by the Community acquis. It will pay particular attention to the cohesion policy in the 2004-2006 period.     Once the programmes have been adopted and the provisions for their implementation are definitively in place, the Commission will examine the conformity of the systems.

   Programme for cooperation in higher education and vocational education and training with the United States     Programme for cooperation in higher education and vocational education and training with the United States     The main objective of this programme is to continue cooperation in higher education and vocational education and training between the European Community and the United States of America.     ACT     Council Decision       2006/910/EC      of 4 December 2006 concerning the conclusion of an Agreement between the European Community and the United States of America renewing a programme of cooperation in higher education and vocational education and training.     SUMMARY     This agreement is set against the dual background of the European Union's action to support higher education, and EU/US relations. The EU's action is intended to make European higher education a world reference for relevance and excellence, while bilateral relations call for greater cooperation in education.     The programme will support some 274 projects over an eight year period. Approximately 6000 EU and US citizens will participate in mobility activities over the duration of the programme.      OBJECTIVES OF THE PROGRAMME      The programme for cooperation in higher education and vocational education and training pursues a number of objectives.     As       general objectives      , it aims to promote mutual understanding between the two partners, including through language, culture and institutions, and to improve the quality of human resource development in order to meet the challenges of the global knowledge-based economy.     It also has the following       specific objectives      :      enhancing cooperation between the European Community and the United States;       contributing to the development of higher education and vocational training institutions;       contributing to individual participants' personal development for their own sake and as a way to achieve its general objectives;       fostering transatlantic exchanges between the citizens of the two partners.      Its       operational objectives      are to:      support higher education and vocational training institutions with a view to promoting joint study programmes and mobility;       improve the quality of transatlantic student mobility through transparency, mutual recognition of qualifications, periods of study and training, and portability of academic credits;       support collaboration between public and private organisations active in the field of higher education and vocational training with a view to encouraging discussion and exchange of experience;       support transatlantic mobility of professionals with a view to improving mutual understanding of issues between the two partners.       LINES OF ACTION      The agreement sets out five lines of action to achieve the programme's objectives.      Action 1: Consortia projects      Action on consortia projects is aimed at higher education and vocational training institutions and organisations, and their staff, students and trainees.     Joint consortia projects should normally involve transatlantic mobility of students in joint study programmes. Flows in each direction should be equal and they should plan for the language and cultural preparation which will be needed.     This type of project provides support for double or joint degrees set up and run by multilateral consortia of EU and US higher education institutions, including scholarships for students, academic and administrative staff.      Action 2: Excellence mobility projects      The support provided by the programme is intended mainly for consortia projects run by higher education and vocational training institutions with a proven record of excellence, including those funded under the previous agreements.      Action 3: Policy-oriented measures      This action is targeted at organisations dealing with higher education and vocational training. Activities under this category include study sessions, conferences, seminars, working groups and benchmarking exercises.      Action 4: "Schuman-Fulbright" individual mobility grants      This action is intended for professionals (including professionals in training) who wish to study or train in areas of specific relevance to EU/US relations. The professionals it is aimed at include, in particular, decision makers, representatives of the social partners and journalists.      Action 5: Alumni Association      Action by the programme in this area is aimed at alumni associations whose members participated in exchanges supported by the programme.      PROGRAMME ADMINISTRATION      A Joint Committee has been established. It consists of an equal number of representatives from each party. Decisions are reached by consensus. Its role is to:      review the cooperation activities envisaged under this agreement;       provide an annual report to the parties on the level, status and effectiveness of cooperation undertaken under this agreement.      Activities under this programme will be financed on an equal basis. The proposed programme would cost a maximum of 46 million over the period 2006-2013, provided that matching funds are made available by the US.      BACKGROUND      On 18 May 2005 the Commission adopted a communication on a       stronger EU-US partnership      , which, in line with the       Lisbon strategy      , identified cooperation in education and training as an important tool for stimulating knowledge and innovation, and called for the renewal and reinforcement of the current agreement on higher education and vocational training.     This agreement renews the       cooperation programme for 2000-2005      originally established under the 1995 Agreement between the European Community and the United States of America.

Communication from th Commission of 27 June 2005 on the evaluation of the cooperation programmes between the European Community and the United States of America in the field of higher education and vocational education and training and between the European Community and Canada in the field of higher education and training [         COM (2005) 0274        - Not published in the Official Journal].      This is the Commission's interim report on implementation of the EU-US cooperation programme. On the basis of positive external evaluations, the Commission states that the programme has widely succeeded in establishing long-term transatlantic partnerships in higher education and vocational training. Almost all the projects established exchanges of students based on joint programmes of study or programmes drawn up together. The report notes that the programmes achieved the objectives of improving the quality of education and training systems.     The Commission presents the suggestions made by the experts with a view to improving certain aspects of the programmes, but emphasises the absence of major shortcomings. It also mentions that some of the potential has remained unexploited for want of sufficient budgetary resources.

   FIFG: Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance     FIFG: Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance     The Regulation on the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) sets out the policy priorities and the terms of assistance for the fisheries and aquaculture sector for the period 2000-06. The FIFG is designed to help achieve the aims of the common fisheries policy by providing structural assistance. It thus strengthens the competitiveness of the operating structures and the development of economically viable enterprises.     ACT     Council Regulation (EC) No       1263/1999      of 21 June 1999 on the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance     SUMMARY     The aim of the FIFG is to contribute to achieving the objectives of the common fisheries policy. It supports structural measures in fisheries, aquaculture and the processing and marketing of fishery and aquaculture products. In this way it promotes the restructuring of the sector by putting in place the right conditions for its development and modernisation.      Objectives      The aims of the FIFG's structural measures are to:      contribute to achieving a balance between fisheries resources and their exploitation,       strengthen the competitiveness of operating structures and the development of economically viable enterprises in the sector;       improve market supply and the value added to fishery and aquaculture products;       contribute to revitalising areas dependent on fisheries and aquaculture.       Scope      This Regulation grants FIFG support to the following in line with the FIFG's overall objectives:      fleet renewal and modernisation of fishing vessels;       adjustment of fishing effort;       joint enterprises;       small-scale coastal fisheries;       socio-economic measures;       protection of marine resources in coastal waters;       aquaculture;       fishing port facilities;       processing and marketing of fishery and aquaculture products;       seeking new outlets for such products;       operations by members of the trade;       innovative actions, in particular those of a transnational nature and involving the networking of operators and areas dependent on the sector.       technical assistance.       Programming      This Regulation firmly links the FIFG both to the structural policy established by Council Regulation (EC) No       1260/1999      laying down       general provisions on the Structural Funds      and to the common fisheries policy provided for in Council Regulation (EEC) No       3760/92      .     The structural measures financed by the FIFG fall under different multiannual programmes according to the regional context in which they apply:      where regions are eligible for Structural Funds under         Objective 1        , the measures are included in the programming for that Objective;       where regions are not eligible for Objective 1, the measures are covered by single programming documents in each Member State.

   Iceland – Regional policy     Iceland – Regional policy     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM(2011) 666      final – SEC(2011) 1202 final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The       2011 Report      highlights that Iceland’s participation in the       European Economic Area      (EEA) has enabled it to achieve a high level of alignment with the European Union (EU)       acquis      . However, the country must strengthen its capacity to manage and monitor the cohesion policy.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission’s words)      In the field of regional policy, the       acquis      essentially comprises framework regulations and implementing regulations which do not require transposition into national law. They define the rules applicable to the development, approval and implementation of the       Structural Funds      and the       Cohesion Fund      , which each reflect the territorial organisation of the country. These programmes are negotiated and agreed with the Commission, but their implementation is the responsibility of the Member States. When choosing and implementing projects, Member States must comply with Community legislation in general, for example in the areas of public procurement, competition and the environment. They must have a suitable institutional framework and administrative capacities to ensure that the programming, implementation, monitoring and assessment of projects are carried out in a rational and cost-effective manner with regards to management and financial control.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      Iceland has achieved limited progress in the field of       regional policy      and the coordination of       European structural instruments      . An overall action plan is being prepared in order to build the administrative capacity of the country. The country must also identify the institutions responsible for implementing the cohesion policy and for developing appropriate management mechanisms for financial control, monitoring actions and for evaluating programmes.

   Charging: interoperable electronic fee collection systems in Europe     Charging: interoperable electronic fee collection systems in Europe     This Communication aims to define a Community strategy for the convergence of interoperable electronic fee collection systems to facilitate traffic flow and the payment of fees, in particular for subscribers, heavy goods vehicles and long distance coaches.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 21 December 1998 on interoperable electronic fee collection systems in Europe [       COM(1998) 795      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY      Background      Electronic Fee Collection (EFC) systems offer the possibility of charging road vehicles in a more flexible way and allow infrastructure charging policies to be implemented. It is vital for such systems to be interoperable across national borders to avoid creating new obstacles to traffic flow in Europe. Interoperability should therefore enable users to travel throughout the Union without charging procedures changing from one country to another and without having to install extra equipment to access other charging zones. This does not mean there would be one single supplier but that there should be sufficient technical compatibility between different systems so that paying charges on different stretches of road in the Union would be a seamless operation. Interoperability is, therefore, an important factor from the viewpoint of the single market, transport policy and the development of the information society.     This Communication examines the obstacles to interoperable electronic fee collection systems and puts forward certain recommendations for arriving at an appropriate level of interoperability on a European scale.      Issues to be resolved      The first major issue studied is technical interoperability. Existing motorway EFC systems make use of Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) between fixed roadside equipment and vehicles. Another type of system is based on satellite location (Global Navigation Satellite System) (GNSS) and mobile telephone technology (GSM).     The first step towards interoperability should be the definition of a common minimum level of functionality to enable authorised subscribers to pay fees using the same method of payment and the same equipment anywhere on the network of operators belonging to the system.     The second major issue is contractual interoperability. The existence of interoperable equipment needs to be accompanied by contractual agreements between infrastructure operators. The same concept of a common minimum level of functionality should therefore be applied.     In this context, the approach recommended in the Communication suggests that EU projects need to involve closer cooperation with operators on the definition of a minimum common functionality taking into account, as a first priority, cross border traffic of heavy goods vehicles and long distance coaches. The definition of a minimum common functionality should form the basis for a draft agreement between operators wishing to achieve interoperability.     European and national standardisation bodies should, for their part, finalise work on the standardisation of the DSRC link and other systems such as those that use satellite location and cellular telephone communication.     A very important issue is the treatment of "non-equipped users", that is, drivers who have no equipment and those who have equipment which is not compatible with the system in the motorway concession area in which they are travelling.     With regard to this, the Communication recalls that within the framework of Community legislation, each country should be free to implement its own choice of options for the treatment of non-equipped users, according to its particular national characteristics, in particular those of the road network and traffic.     As for the issue of classification, a common set of vehicle characteristics needs to be agreed which can be used for classification, as electronic fee collection systems need to recognise vehicle categories in order to apply the tariff for the use of the tolled road.     As a consequence, a common set of declared parameters needs to be defined during negotiations between operators.     As for the issues linked to the enforcement of tolling, the Commission will study the establishment of a general framework at EU level for the prosecution of EFC violations across national borders, to be used either as a basis for or to complement bilateral agreements. National authorities, for their part, need to be encouraged to establish effective links between toll enforcing administrations or operators and national registration databases to facilitate cross-border enforcement.     The protection of personal data and system security may be another major obstacle to achieving interoperability between systems. According to the approach chosen by the Commission, the presumption should be that general rules on information security and numerical data protection must be applied and will be sufficient unless there is a convincing case otherwise. National authorities and operators must, however, be encouraged to examine whether any additional measures are necessary.     Given the present differences in existing technologies in the different Member States, a strategy for convergence comprising several stages must be envisaged prior to interoperability. These successive stages will allow interoperability to be guaranteed for a growing number of functions and the above-mentioned issues to be progressively overcome.      Actions to be carried out      In this context, this Communication defines the main actions of the first phase (1998 to 2000) that the Commission will carry out with Member States, local and regional authorities, operators and standardisation bodies.     These actions can be summarised as follows:      to define and agree a common minimum level of functionality for equipment at European level;       to enable these functions to be performed, the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) should complete its work on electronic fee collection and define, validate and adopt those standards that are still necessary in the area of short range radio communications (DSRC) and any other necessary areas;       the Commission will help the interested parties to complete work on contractual interoperability;       the Commission will explore the necessary means for facilitating cross-border enforcement while guaranteeing the protection of personal data and privacy;       the Commission will also cooperate on the introduction of urban tolls, so as to ensure compatibility between this and inter-urban systems.      The Commission will draw up proposals based on this approach and will put forward proposals for actions for subsequent phases on the basis of the results obtained in the first phase.

Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the widespread introduction and interoperability of electronic road toll systems in the Community [         COM(2003) 132        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      This proposal was announced in the White Paper on transport policy. Its purpose is to create a European electronic toll service so as to ensure the interoperability of toll systems in the internal market and help with the formulation of infrastructure charging policies at the European level.     The service is based on the principle of "one contract per customer, one box per vehicle" and will serve to reduce congestion, improve traffic flow and limit cash transactions at toll stations.      Co-decision procedure (COD/2003/81)      On 23 April 2003 the proposal was adopted by the Commission.     On 25 April 2003 the proposal was sent to Parliament and the Council.

act   Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council - A new EU framework to strengthen the rule of law (  COM(2014) 158 final  of 11.3.2014).   summary   This Commission communication sets out a  new EU framework to strengthen the rule of law  to ensure effective and equal protection of the rule of law* in all EU countries.   what does this framework do  The purpose of the framework is to address ‘systemic threats to the rule of law’ in any of the EU's 28 countries. It establishes an early warning tool allowing the Commission to enter into dialogue with the country concerned in order to prevent the escalation of systemic threats to the rule of law.   key points   The framework is designed to complement existing means of protecting the EU's rule of law. These include  infringement procedures  (limited to a breach of a specific provision of EU law) against EU countries, and the ‘last resort’  preventive and sanctioning mechanisms  provided for in  Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union  (TEU).   How the new framework will work   The purpose of the framework is to enable the Commission to find a solution with the EU country concerned so as to prevent the emergence of a systemic threat to the rule of law. It will apply in the same way to all EU countries and will operate according to the same standards.  National ‘rule of law safeguards’ should in principle be sufficient to address potential problems and can be found in a country's:        —     political, institutional and/or legal order;            —     constitutional structure;            —     separation of powers (for example between the legislature, executive and judiciary);            —     independence or impartiality of its judiciary or its system of judicial review (i.e. where courts can rule on the validity of an action).      The framework will be activated when national ‘rule of law safeguards’ do not seem capable of effectively addressing threats in an EU country.   3-stage process   If there is a clear risk of a systemic threat to the rule of law in an EU country, the Commission will start a structured dialogue with that country to seek a solution. This process includes:        —      Commission's assessment  : the Commission may issue a ‘rule of law opinion’, giving the country concerned time to respond;            —      Commission's recommendation  : the Commission may issue a ‘rule of law recommendation’ (ways in which the country can swiftly and practically solve the problems found);            —      Follow-up to the Commission’s recommendation  : if the EU country does not respond satisfactorily, the Commission will consider using the mechanisms under Article 7 of the TEU to suspend that country’s rights under the EU treaties, including its voting rights in the Council.      The Commission will keep the European Parliament and the Council informed of progress at all stages of the process. It may also seek external advice and expertise, such as from the  European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights  or European legal experts.   background    The EU and the rule of law   The  rule of law  is a founding and constitutional principle of the EU as outlined in the TEU and the EU  Charter of Fundamental Rights  . It enables EU citizens and national authorities to have confidence in the legal systems of all EU countries.

summary of   Communication (COM(2015) 44 final) — A Global Partnership for Poverty Eradication and Sustainable Development after 2015   what is the aim of the communication   In putting forward proposals on how the international community should organise its action to deliver on the  Sustainable Development Goals  (SDGs), the Commission’s communication shows specifically how the European Union (EU), EU countries and others could contribute to the international effort to implement the 2030 Agenda.   It sets out the views of the  European Commission  on a new global partnership to eradicate poverty and boost sustainable development in the context of the inter-governmental negotiations leading to the  Addis Ababa Action Agenda  and the  2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development  .   key points   The Commission describes the  overarching principles  and  components necessary  for the  global partnership  needed to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (prior to its adoption at the  UN Summit  in September 2015).   Principles   The Commission called for the global partnership to be based on universal values such as    human rights  ,   good governance and the  rule of law  ,   support for democratic institutions,   inclusiveness,   non-discrimination, and   gender equality.    Components   The partnership should also:    1.    promote a  policy environment conducive to the implementation of the2030 Agenda  through practices, actions and resources at both international and national level;      2.     develop additional and new capacities in partner countries and enhance skills  focusing on developing human resources and processes for planning, management and monitoring;      3.    ensure that  national public resources  are mobilised efficiently and sustainably;      4.    contribute to maintaining the  UN target of 0.7 % Gross National Income  for financing Official Development Assistance (ODA) and focus on receiving contributions from  upper middle-income countries  and emerging economies (like China or Brazil);      5.     enhance trade  as a key factor for sustainable inclusive growth and sustainable development through  Trade Facilitation Agreements  ;      6.    use the potential offered by  science, technology and innovation,  for example, to help people escape from poverty, promote sustainable consumption or reduce vulnerability to disasters;      7.    encourage the domestic and international  private sector  to invest in efficient and sustainable transport and energy systems, and digital infrastructures;      8.    exploit the  positive effects of migration  allowing legal migrants to keep more of what they earn and recognising their skills and qualifications;      9.     better monitor and evaluate  the implementation of the SDGs to ensure that it is underpinned by principles such as transparency, inclusiveness responsiveness, effectiveness and efficiency, including in its financing aspects.     These proposals formed part of the EU negotiating position for the  Financing for Development conference  in Addis Ababa in July 2015 and the UN Summit in New York in September 2015 which led to adoption of the 2030 Agenda. The Commission’s communication led to  Council Conclusions  in May 2015.   background    The  United Nations (UN)  has led an intergovernmental process to help define the future global development framework to succeed the  Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  and follow up on the  Rio +20  and  Monterrey  conferences.   Between 2013 and September 2015, the EU played an active role in the preparatory discussions leading to the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and has provided its input in key documents (see Related documents section below). These documents served as a basis for negotiation with all international partners.

summary of   Regulation (EU) 2016/1076 — arrangements for products originating in certain ACP states   what is the aim of the regulation  It  revises  and replaces Regulation (EC) No  1528/2007  concerning the arrangements for products originating in certain  African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP)  countries provided for in agreements establishing, or leading to the establishment, of  Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs)  . Specifically, it removes from the scope of that regulation those countries that have not taken the necessary steps towards ratification of EPAs with the EU.   key points    Scope    Regulation (EU) 2016/1076, as amended by several  delegated acts  , applies to countries listed in its Annex I  *  .   Regions or countries from the ACP which take steps to conclude EPAs with the EU fulfilling certain criteria may be added to the list.   Countries that had not taken the necessary steps to ratify their EPA concluded with the EU (and which were removed from the scope of this regulation) may be added to the list if they take those steps.   Countries on the list may be removed from the list if the  European Commission  finds that they do not take steps to ratify their agreements, if the entry into force is unduly delayed or if the agreement is stopped.    Market access    Trade preferences will continue to be granted to these countries from 1 January 2008.   The listed countries are granted  duty-free  ,  quota-free access  (with the exception of arms and ammunition) to the EU market.    Safeguard measures   A safeguard measure can be imposed where products coming from one of the listed regions or countries are imported into the EU in such increased quantities and in such a way that they cause or may cause:   serious  injury to EU industry  ;   disturbances in a sector of the economy, particularly where they cause  major social problems  or difficulties that could  seriously worsen  the economic situation of the EU; or   disturbances in the markets of  agricultural products  ;   a disturbance in the economic situation of one or more the  outermost regions  of the EU.   Measures that can be taken for the product concerned include:   suspension of the further reduced rate of  import duty  coming from the region or state concerned;   increase in the  customs duty  up to a level which does not exceed the customs duty applied to other  World Trade Organisation members  ;   a tariff quota.   Such measures cannot last more than  4 years  .   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 28 July 2016. Regulation (EU) 2016/1076  revised  and replaced Regulation (EC) No  1528/2007  and its subsequent amendments.   background   For more information, see:    Trade with ACP countries  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    ACP countries in Annex I:  Antigua and Barbuda, the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, the Republic of Botswana, the Republic of Cameroon, the Union of Comoros, the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire, the Commonwealth of Dominica, the Dominican Republic, the Republic of Fiji, the Republic of Ghana, Grenada, the Cooperative Republic of Guyana, Jamaica, the Republic of Kenya, the Kingdom of Lesotho, the Republic of Madagascar, the Republic of Mauritius, the Republic of Mozambique, the Republic of Namibia, the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, the independent State of Samoa, the Republic of Seychelles, Solomon Islands, the Republic of Suriname, the Kingdom of Swaziland, the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, the Republic of Zimbabwe.
   Human rights and relations in the Mediterranean     Human rights and relations in the Mediterranean     The Commission is making recommendations for bringing about a stable democratic environment and full enjoyment of human rights in the Mediterranean partner countries of the European Union (EU).     ACT     Communication of 21 May 2003 from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament "Reinvigorating EU actions on Human Rights and democratisation with Mediterranean partners. Strategic guidelines" [       COM(2003) 294      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     In this communication the European Commission makes ten recommendations for enhancing political dialogue and financial cooperation on human rights between the EU and its partners of the Mediterranean region (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia and the Palestinian Authority). These recommendations will be implemented at three interrelated levels:      through political dialogue and financial aid;       through the regional aid given to the         MEDA programme        and the         European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights        (EIDHR); and       at regional level.       The ten recommendations      The EU should ensure that the issues of human rights and democracy are systematically included in all institutionalised bilateral dialogues with Mediterranean partners. It should explore with its partners the possibility of setting up technical sub-groups (below the political level) to address these issues. More cooperation would also be desirable on matters such as legal reforms, the regulatory frameworks for civil society and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), freedom of speech and association and women's rights.     To promote a regular, in-depth dialogue on human rights and democratisation in the region the Union should ensure that more people know about the key human rights issues and available documentation in each of the Mediterranean countries. Standard methods of analysis and regularly updated data should be used to produce fact sheets on the situation in each of the partner countries.     The Commission should seek to ensure greater cooperation between its Delegations in Mediterranean countries and the Member States' embassies in the same countries. The human rights related issues of the MEDA and EIDHR programmes should be handled by experts. A further aim of such cooperation should be the implementation of UN human rights resolutions.     Workshops on human rights issues should be organised in cooperation with civil society and the national authorities of the Mediterranean countries. Such workshops would provide the EU with local knowledge, which it could use in identifying projects for implementation under EIDHR, and with a platform for promoting its policies on human rights, democratisation and the rule of law. The workshops would also help those engaged in Mediterranean civil society affairs to coordinate and plan their activities more effectively.     National action plans on human rights (drawn up for the MEDA programme) should take account of the situation in the country concerned, in particular its human rights legislation. The plans should set out the objectives and the financial and technical assistance needed. They should encourage the Mediterranean partner countries to accede to international human rights conventions and promote cooperation between the state and civil society.     Regional human rights action plans should be established whenever two or more partner countries wish to cooperate more closely on this issue. Their plans could, for instance, focus on women's rights or co-operation in the field of justice. They could also strengthen contacts with regional bodies such as the Arab League.     Starting in 2005, the human rights and democracy dimensions should be given more prominence in national indicative programmes and country strategy papers drawn up for the MEDA programme. Extra funds will be provided for this objective.     Also starting in 2005, human rights, democracy and the involvement of civil society should play a bigger part in the regional indicative programme and regional strategy applied under MEDA.     The EIDHR's role in the Mediterranean should be modified to include helping to build up the capacity of civil society in the region to engage in matters such as freedom of association and speech, defence/advocacy of the rights of specific groups, good governance and fighting corruption. The MEDA and EIDHR programmes should complement each other more than they do at present.     Synergies between existing instruments created to observe and assist in elections (political dialogue, MEDA, EIDHR) should also be fully exploited to improve the framework within which elections are held in the region's different countries.      The human rights situation in the Mediterranean      This Communication summarises the UNDP Arab Human Development Report for 2002. The report's main conclusions are:      deficits in governance (in connection with freedoms, marginalisation of women, preventing their access to knowledge) hamper the full development of democracy and respect of human rights;       discrimination against women hampers economic and social development;       the judicial system is not independent enough;       NGOs active in the civil and political spheres are weak and are prevented from networking internationally;       access to education is uneven and ill-adapted to the requirements of the modern economy;       authoritarianism and poor economic and social performance favour extremist political movements.      Although most of the countries in the region have signed up to the most important international instruments on human rights, this is not reflected in the situation on the ground since the countries do not comply with these international standards.      Context: European Union measures in the Mediterranean region      The Commission communication entitled "On the       EU's Role in Promoting Human Rights      and Democratisation in Third Countries" establishes a human rights strategy for application in the Union's external affairs. The aim of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership agreements concluded between the European Union and each of the region's countries is to establish an area of peace and stability founded on the principles of human rights and democracy. Similarly, the       Action Plan agreed at the Valencia conference      reaffirmed the commitment of all the parties to human rights, democracy and the rule of law in this region, whilst the association agreements concluded or under negotiation with the Mediterranean countries include the condition of engaging in a political dialogue covering, inter alia, issues of human rights and democracy. The Union's operational cooperation instruments for human rights in the Mediterranean are the MEDA programme, which has been up and running since 1996, and the EIDHR which was set up in 1994.

These rules will be applicable to all payment service providers (PSP) involved in the payment chain. The This Regulation aims to transpose into Community legislation Special Recommendation VII on "wire transfers" (SR VII) of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF       *      ).     The Regulation does not apply to transfers of funds       *      which flow from a commercial transaction carried out using a credit or debit card or any other similar payment instrument, provided that a unique identifier allowing the transaction to be traced back to the payer accompanies all transfers of funds flowing from that commercial transaction and that the beneficiary has entered into agreement with the payment service provider enabling the payment of the provision of goods and services.     Furthermore, under the same conditions as the previous point, this regulation does not apply to transfers of funds carried out via a mobile telephone or any other digital device or linked to IT, when the payments are post paid and insofar as the payment service provider must comply with obligations stated by Directive       2005/60/EC      .     In addition, the Regulation will not apply to transfers of funds where both the payer       *      and the payee       *      are payment service providers acting on their own behalf.     Under the Regulation, the payer's payment service provider       *      (PSP) must ensure that transfers of funds contain complete, accurate and meaningful information on the payer. Any intermediary PSP must also ensure that all information on the payer that accompanies a transfer is transferred with it or retained in an appropriate manner.     In turn, any payment service provider       *      of the payer must report suspicious transactions to the authorities responsible for combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The payee's PSP must be able to detect a lack of presence of information on the payer when receiving transfers and must take appropriate steps to correct this situation (refuse the transfer or ask for further information) so that received transfers of funds do not remain anonymous.     Accordingly, the name, address and account number of the person ordering the payment must always accompany the transfer. Access to this information will be granted to the competent authorities only for the purposes of preventing, investigating, detecting and prosecuting money laundering or terrorist financing.     An open consultation exercise on this Regulation was conducted online between 2 December 2003 and 15 February 2004. The Commission received 103 replies. The results are available on the website of the       Directorate-General for the Internal Market      .      Context: combating terrorist financing      In the European Union's revised Plan of Action to Combat Terrorism (       PDF      ) of 18 June 2004, the Council emphasised the importance of adopting measures designed to prevent the phenomenon of terrorist financing. The European Council of 25 March 2004 called on the Member States "to increase cooperation between national competent authorities, financial intelligence units and private financial institutions to facilitate improved exchange of information on terrorist financing".     In that same statement, the Council also asked the Commission to consider improvements on the regulation and transparency of non-profit bodies so as to prevent them from being used by terrorists to acquire funding for their activities.     For its part, the Commission adopted a communication on prevention in this field in October 2004 and unveiled in December of that year the Union's strategy for combating terrorist financing. This document, drawn up on the basis of the proposals made jointly by the Commission and the Secretary-General High Representative, takes stock of measures implemented in this field and contains a list of recommendations for strengthening action by the Union.       Key terms used in the act         "Payee": A natural or legal person who is the intended final recipient of transferred funds.         "Payer": a natural or legal person who is the account holder and who allows a transfer of funds to leave the aforementioned account, or in the absence of an account, the natural or legal person who gives the order to carry out a transfer of funds.         FAFT: The intergovernmental body responsible for designing and promoting, at both national and international level, strategies to combat money laundering and terrorism financing.         "Payment service provider" (PSP): A natural or legal person whose business includes the provision of fund transfer services.         "Intermediary payment service provider": A payment service provider which is neither that of the payer nor that of the payee and which participates in the execution of transfers of funds.         "Transfer of funds": Any transaction carried out on behalf of a payer through a payment service provider by electronic means with a view to making funds available to a payee at another payment service provider, irrespective of whether the payer and the payee are the same person.

summary of   Decision (EU) 2015/1848 — guidelines for employment policies in EU countries in 2015   what is the aim of the decision  It sets out European Union (EU) priorities and targets for national employment policies. They are part of the guidelines of the  Europe 2020  growth strategy and support the aims of the  European Semester  of economic policy coordination.   key points    New approach    The  employment guidelines  are the  second part  of the integrated guidelines for implementing the Europe 2020 strategy. They work alongside the  broad economic policy guidelines  for EU countries and the EU which are set out in  Council Recommendation (EU) 2015/1184  .   These integrated guidelines are based on a new approach to EU economic policymaking based on:   investment;   structural reform; and   establishing and maintening a balanced budget (  fiscal responsibility  ).      Key areas   The decision sets out guidelines targeting four key areas:    1.     Boosting demand for labour  — focusing on job creation, labour taxation and wage-setting.      2.     Enhancing labour supply, skills and competences  — making structural improvements to education and training systems and tackling youth and long-term unemployment.      3.     Making labour markets work better  — ensuring high quality employment (e.g. education and training, work-life balance) and making it easier for workers to move between EU countries.      4.     Fairness, combating poverty and promoting equal opportunities  — e.g. providing affordable, accessible and high-quality services such as childcare, education, training and health services.     These guidelines form the basis for  morespecific recommendations  from the  Council  aimed at individual EU countries.   from when does the decision apply  It has applied since 9 October 2015.   background   For more information, see:    ‘European employment strategy’  on the European Commission's website.
summary of   Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 establishing a European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders   summary    what does this regulation do  It establishes  Frontex  , the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union.  Regulation (EU) No  1168/2011  amends the original act to  improve the integrated management  of the EU’s external borders and to  enhance cooperation  between national border guard authorities.  A further amendment, Regulation (EU) No  656/2014  , lays down rules for the surveillance of the EU’s  external sea borders in the context of operational cooperation managed by  Frontex.   key points    Tasks   Frontex’s main tasks are:   planning and coordinating  joint operations  and rapid border interventions conducted by the Agency using EU countries’ staff and equipment at sea, land and air external borders;   coordinating  joint return operations  of foreign nationals staying illegally in the EU and Schengen countries* and refusing to leave voluntarily;   drawing up  common training standards and tools  for national border guards;   carrying out  risk analyses  (with a view to improving the integrated management of the EU’s external borders);   assisting Schengen countries requiring  increased technical and operational assistance  at external borders (e.g. humanitarian emergencies and rescue at sea or when they face disproportionate pressures on their borders);   developing a  rapid response capability  involving EU Border Guard Teams (see below), as well as a database of available equipment and resources to be deployed in the event of a crisis situation.    Equipment   Frontex can buy/lease its own equipment for border control (cars, vessels, helicopters, etc.) or jointly buy it with EU countries.   Operational plan   An operational plan (drawn up prior to joint operations, rapid border interventions and pilot projects) should include all aspects of the given activity, such as:   tasks and responsibilities,   composition of the teams,   command and control arrangements (e.g. names and ranks of host country’s border guards responsible for cooperating with Frontex and with guest officers from other EU countries working on joint operations),   evaluation and incident reporting, and the applicable jurisdiction (e.g. in the event of sea operations), etc.    EU Border Guard Teams   European Border Guard Teams are deployed in joint operations, rapid border interventions and pilot projects coordinated by Frontex.  They are composed of border guards from the EU countries, experts in different areas of border management, including:   border checks;   land and sea border surveillance;   identification of false documents specialists; and   identification of irregular migrants’ nationalities.    Cooperation   Frontex may cooperate with  Europol  , the  European Asylum Support Office  , the  EU Fundamental Rights Agency  , non-EU country authorities and international organisations such as, the  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  and International Organisation for Migration (IOM).   Eurosur   In 2013, under a separate regulation, the  European Border Surveillance System  (Eurosur) became operational. This information-exchange framework is designed to improve the management of the EU’s external borders. It aims to support EU countries by:   increasing their awareness and reaction capability in combating cross-border crime;   tackling irregular migration; and   preventing the loss of migrants’ lives at sea.   Frontex plays an important role in the compilation and analysis of the ‘European situational picture’, a review of the events that have recently taken place at the borders of certain EU countries and that could help detect changing routes or new methods used by criminal networks.   from when does the regulation apply  It applies from 1 May 2005.   background   Frontex became operational in 2005. It is based in Warsaw, Poland.  In the context of the  European Agenda on Migration  , in December 2015, the  European Commission  issued a  proposal  to create a  European Border and Coast Guard Agency  . This would be built from Frontex and the EU countries’ authorities responsible for border management and would permit a more integrated management of the EU’s external borders.   key term    * Schengen countries  : European countries that have signed an  agreement  to remove border controls and allow free movement of all nationals of the signatory countries, other EU countries and some non-EU countries.  The Schengen countries are as follows: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.   act   Council Regulation (EC) No  2007/2004  of 26 October 2004 establishing a European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (OJ L 349, 25.11.2004, pp. 1-11).

   Civil aviation rules and the EASA     Civil aviation rules and the EASA     SUMMARY OF:      Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Union Aviation Safety Agency      WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?     It aims to establish a high and uniform level of civil aviation safety while ensuring environmental protection.     It updates aviation safety law and includes:      a revised mandate for the         European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)        ;       new rules designed to allow the EU aviation sector to grow, make it more competitive and encourage innovation.      KEY POINTS     The regulation covers       all key areas of aviation      including:      airworthiness;       aircrews;       aerodromes;       air operations; and       air navigation services.      The regulation:      includes rules for unmanned aircraft (civil drones);       aims to facilitate simpler rules for sport and recreational aviation;       sets out a division of tasks between the EU and national authorities;       repeals three previous regulations (Regulations (EC) No         552/2004        and (EC) No         216/2008        of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Regulation (EEC) No         3922/91        );       amends two directives (Directives         2014/30/EU        on         reducing interference between electrical and electronic devices        and         2014/53/EU        on the         commercialisation of radio equipment        ) and four regulations ((EC) No         2111/2005        on the establishment of a list of         banned air carriers and on the identity        of the operating carrier, (EC) No         1008/2008        on the         operation of air services        , (EU) No         996/2010        on         civil aviation accidents and incidents        , (EU) No         376/2014        on         occurrences in civil aviation        ); and       complements Regulations (EU) No         1321/2014        on         airworthiness        and (EU) No         748/2012        on         environmental certification        .       Main changes and additions       The regulation updates EU safety legislation in the aviation sector. Essential requirements are established for aircraft with respect to their airworthiness and environmental compatibility. Manufacturers will be required to issue         certificates of airworthiness        , in accordance with the technical requirements.       It introduces         risk- and performance-based rules        which set objectives but leave some flexibility as to the means for achieving them. It also promotes taking non-binding measures (such as safety promotion actions) whenever this is possible.       It         revises the scope        of some rules, by excluding small, single occupancy hot-air balloons, adjusting the weight limits for sailplanes, and adding light electric aircraft. It introduces reforms to:          deal with the growth of air traffic;           increase security;           reduce costs, delays and the impact of air traffic on the environment.          Cabin crew        involved in commercial air transport are subject to certification and should be issued with an attestation. The         European Commission        has established detailed rules and procedures for the qualification of cabin crew members. The regulation also sets out essential requirements for safe         ground handling services        , which are now included within the scope of the regulation, and closes a number of other safety gaps.       A new chapter on         aviation safety management        is introduced, establishing the         European Aviation Safety Programme        , covering the whole aviation safety system.       Civil drones       The regulation introduces essential requirements for drones. The rules are meant to be proportionate to the risk of the particular operation or type of operation and state that the drone must be safely controllable and manoeuvrable. It should be designed to fit its function and intended type of operation, and take into account privacy and protection of personal data by design and by default. Identification of the drone and of the nature and purpose of the operation should also be possible.       The drone operator should be responsible for its operation and should have knowledge and skills proportionate to operating the drone safely. Organisations involved in drone design, production, maintenance, operations, related services and training, must establish a safety occurrence reporting system.       The regulation specifies the         registration threshold        that applies to drone operators: operators must be registered if they operate drones which can transfer more than         80 Joules of kinetic energy        upon impact with a person. This threshold can be amended in the future without lengthy procedures to take account of developments in this area.       Depending on the nature and risk of the activity, the operational characteristics of the aircraft and the characteristics of area of operation, a         certificate        may be required for design, production, maintenance and operation as well as for personnel, including remote pilots.       In accordance with the regulation, the Commission, with the help of EASA, drew up Regulation (EU)         2019/947        which lays down         detailed rules for drones        and for         drones’ operation        . Regulation (EU)         2020/746        amends Regulation (EU) 2019/947, postponing the dates of application of certain measures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.       Pilot licences issued by non-EU countries      Regulation (EU)       2020/723      lays down the detailed rules for the conditions for the acceptance of pilot licences and associated ratings, privileges or certificates, as well as associated medical certificates issued in accordance with laws of non-EU countries.      European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)       The regulation extends EASA’s scope to safety-related aspects of security, such as         cybersecurity        , and to         environmental protection        .       It establishes a mechanism for the pooling and sharing of aviation inspectors, and other technical assistance to support EU countries in certification, oversight and enforcement tasks.       The         electronic information repository        established by the Agency to ensure effective cooperation between the Agency and the national competent authorities includes information on the reallocation by one EU country to another or to the Agency of responsibilities related to certification, oversight and enforcement, as well as measures concerning flights above conflict zones.      FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?     It has applied since 11 September 2018.

   Parental leave and leave for family reasons     Parental leave and leave for family reasons     The Directive makes the framework agreement on parental leave concluded between the general cross-industry organisations compulsory. It also asks the Member States to lay down penalties for infringements of national measures taken in implementation of the Directive.     ACT     Council Directive       96/34/EC      of 3 June 1996 on the framework agreement on parental leave concluded by UNICE, CEEP and the ETUC [       Amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     The framework agreement on parental leave concluded on 14 December 1995 between the general cross-industry organisations (       UNICE      ,       CEEP      and the       ETUC      ), annexed to the Directive, is made compulsory.      Content of the framework agreement      The framework agreement provides for:      male and female workers to have individual entitlement to parental leave on the grounds of the birth or adoption of a child, enabling them to take care of the child for at least three months;       the conditions of access to, and procedures for applying, parental leave to be defined by law and/or collective agreement in the Member States, subject to compliance with the minimum requirements of the agreement;       the Member States and/or social partners to take the necessary measures to protect workers against dismissal on the grounds of an application for, or the taking of, parental leave;       workers to have the right to return to the same job at the end of parental leave or, if that is not possible, to an equivalent or similar job consistent with their employment contract or relationship;       the maintenance of rights acquired or in the process of being acquired by the worker on the date on which parental leave starts; at the end of the period of leave, those rights will apply;       the Member States and/or the social partners to take the necessary measures to allow workers to take time off from work, in accordance with national legislation, collective agreements and/or practice, for unforeseeable reasons arising from a family emergency in the event of sickness or accident making the immediate presence of the worker indispensable.       More favourable provisions      The Member States may introduce more favourable provisions than those laid down in the Directive.     Implementation of the provisions of the Directive will not in any way constitute sufficient grounds to justify a reduction in the general level of protection afforded to workers in the field covered.      Sanctions      The Member States are to determine the range of penalties applicable for infringements of national provisions pursuant to the Directive, and are to take all the necessary steps to ensure their implementation. The penalties applied must be effective and commensurate with the infringement, and must constitute a sufficient deterrent.      Context      The objective of the Directive is to introduce minimum requirements on parental leave and time off from work on grounds of force majeure. It aims to reconcile occupational and family obligations and to promote equal opportunities and equal treatment for men and women.     This Directive shall be repealed on 8 March 2012. It shall be replaced by Directive       2010/18/EU      on the application of the revised framework agreement on parental leave concluded by BUSINESSEUROPE, UEAPME, CEEP and ETUC.

summary of   European Commission communication (COM(2007) 424 final) – ways to deal with gender-based pay differences   summary    what does this communication do  It examines the reasons women persistently tend to be paid less than men and puts forward possible ways to tackle this discrimination.   key points    The pay gap* can reflect objective differences such as age and experience. But it is also linked to various legal, social and economic factors, such as how jobs are valued.   The pay gap is wider than average in private sector companies. It increases with the size of the business and a person's age, level of education and length of service.   The communication identifies 4 ways to reduce pay discrimination:   Improve the application of existing European legislation and use information campaigns to stress respect for the  principle of equal pay for work of equal value  ,   Exploit to the full the  Europe 2020 strategy  for growth and jobs, which includes reducing the pay gap among its aims,   Encourage employers in both the public and private sectors to implement equal pay,   Exchange examples of good practice at all levels of government.     Directive  2006/54/EC  provides for equal employment conditions for men and women, including pay.   Recommendation  2014/124/EU  advises national governments how to better implement the equal pay principle. The guidance includes:   right of employees to have information on pay levels,   regular reports on average pay levels by companies with over 50 employees,   nationally organised pay audits for companies and organisations with over 250 employees,   up-to-date data on the gender pay gap.     background   The fundamental principle of equal treatment between men and women goes back to the very beginnings of the European Union. It is enshrined in the Treaty on European Union (Articles  2  and  3(3)  ), the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (Articles  8  ,  10  and  157(1)  ), the  Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union  (Article 23) and is 1 of 5 priorities in the  Women's Charter  .   key term    * Pay gap  : this measures the relative difference in the average gross hourly earnings of men and women in the economy as a whole.   act   Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - Tackling the pay gap between women and men (  COM(2007) 424 final  of 18.7.2007)
summary of   Directive 2005/44/EC on harmonised river information services (RIS) on the EU’s inland waterways   what does this directive do  It establishes rules on the use of harmonised river information services (RIS)*. These rules are designed to ensure the safety, efficiency and environmental friendliness of inland waterways in the EU. They apply to canals, rivers, lakes and ports able to take vessels between 1,000 and 1,500 tonnes.   key points    River information services include:   geographical, hydrological and administrative data on waterways (‘fairway information’);   data relevant to navigation in the short, medium and long term (‘tactical and strategic traffic information’);   action in the event of an accident (‘calamity abatement support’);   statistics, customs services, waterway charges and port dues.     EU countries must:   ensure their RIS are efficient, allow for expansion and can coordinate with other systems;   supply all RIS users with the relevant data on navigational and voyage planning;   establish RIS centres according to regional needs;   designate authorities to oversee RIS application and the exchange of international data.     The  European Commission  is responsible for setting out, by agreed deadlines, the technical guidelines for the planning, implementation and operational use of RIS. These include:   an electronic chart display and information system;   electronic ship reporting;   notices to skippers;   vessel tracking and tracing systems;   compatibility of RIS equipment.     The Commission, assisted by a committee of national experts, has developed RIS technical requirements.    Action programme   In 2006, the Commission presented a communication on an  integrated EU action programme for inland waterway transport  . Known as Naiades (Navigation and inland waterway action and development in Europe), the programme was updated in 2013 (Naiades II) and set out specific objectives up to 2020. The Commission’s Naiades II  communication  aims to create the conditions for inland navigation transport to become a quality mode of transport.   from when does the directive apply  It entered into force on 20 October 2005. EU countries had to incorporate it in their national law by 20 October 2007.   background    The EU has over 37,000 km of canals and rivers linking key towns and economic areas. These inland waterways make a major contribution to a sustainable transport system, reducing congestion and pollution on the EU's roads.    River Information Services portal    key terms    * River information services (RIS)  : these support inland navigation traffic and transport management and, where feasible, coordination with other forms of transport.   act   Directive  2005/44/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on harmonised river information services (RIS) on inland waterways in the Community (OJ L 255, 30.9.2005, pp. 152–159)  Successive amendments and corrections to Directive 2005/44/EC have been incorporated in the basic text.

summary of   Directive 92/42/EEC on efficiency requirements for new hot-water boilers fired with liquid or gaseous fuels   summary   Hot-water boilers must meet the EU’s ecodesign requirements.   what does the directive do  It sets out the energy efficiency* requirements for new hot water heaters or ‘boilers’ fired by liquid or gaseous fuels.   key points   The directive applies to boilers with an output of no less than 4 kW and no more than 400 kW, specifically:        —     standard boilers,            —     low-temperature boilers,            —     gas-condensing boilers.      It does not apply to:        —     hot water boilers capable of being fired by different fuels including solid fuels,            —     equipment for instantly preparing hot water,            —     boilers designed to be fired by fuels other than the liquid and gaseous fuels commonly marketed,            —     cookers and appliances which supply hot water for central heating, and which supply sanitary hot water only as a secondary function,            —     appliances with outputs of less than 6 kW which use gravity circulation and are designed solely for the production of stored sanitary hot water,            —     boilers manufactured on a one-off basis — that is, produced once and therefore not manufactured as part of a series,            —     cogeneration units* (  Directive 2004/8/EC  ).       Standardisation and the ‘CE’ marking   Any boiler manufactured in accordance with  harmonised European standards  should conform to the essential requirements set out in the directive. An assessment before affixing the  CE conformity marking  is carried out by:        —     bodies designated by EU countries in accordance with the minimum assessment criteria and notified to the Commission and the other EU countries, or            —     by the manufacturers themselves.       Ecodesign         —     The directive is one of the measures implementing the  Framework Directive 2009/125/EC on ecodesign  , which set out efficiency requirements for individual product groups. It removes the option for EU countries to apply a specific labelling system to boilers which are more efficient than standard ones. Industry sectors can also make voluntary agreements to reduce the energy consumption of their products. The Commission formally approves these agreements and checks on their implementation.            —     The  EU energy efficiency directive  sets compulsory targets for EU countries in order to achieve a 20 % energy efficiency target by 2020. A series of energy efficiency regulations for boilers were published in 2013 as part of this policy. They set out minimum standards and an energy labelling scheme.            —     Regulation (EU) No  813/2013  , which amends Directive 92/42/EEC, sets out the ecodesign requirements for space heaters* and combination heaters* which do not run on biomass and have an output of less than 400 kW.      keywords    * Energy efficiency  : using less energy to provide the same service, i.e. less heating energy to maintain the same temperature.   * Cogeneration  : the simultaneous production of electricity and heat, both of which are used.   * Space heater  : a device, equipped with one or more heat generators, that provides heat to a water-based central heating system to keep an indoor space at an even temperature.   * Combination heater  : a space heater also designed to provide hot drinking or sanitary water which is connected to an external supply of drinking or sanitary water.

   eSafety: the use of information and communication technology (ICT) for road safety     eSafety: the use of information and communication technology (ICT) for road safety     The European Union (EU) wishes to reduce by half the number of road fatalities by 2010. To achieve this goal, it believes that vehicle safety should be enhanced. As ICT offers great prospects in this regard, the Commission proposes the systematic use of these technologies in order to design safer and more intelligent vehicles. To promote the large-scale marketing of intelligent car safety systems, it proposes three types of actions: promoting intelligent safety systems, adapting legislation and standards, and removing social and commercial barriers.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 15 September 2003 on Information and Communications Technologies for Safe and Intelligent Vehicles [       COM(2003) 542      final - Not published in the Official Journal]     SUMMARY     Transport provides for a basic need: mobility. As the number of cars on the road increases, their safety is constantly increased. Nevertheless, 40 000 people still die in road accidents each year which are the main cause of death for people under the age of 45 in Europe. Against this background, new measures are needed to achieve the main objective of the       European Action Programme for Road Safety      which is to reduce by half the number of road fatalities by 2010.     In order to achieve this objective, the Commission is banking on new information and communications technologies (ICT). Aware of the possibilities which ICT offers, the European Commission has launched the       eSafety initiative      which is intended to bring together all the stakeholders in order to work out recommendations and actions at EU level. The final report of the eSafety working group [       PDF      ] indicates that intelligent car safety systems offer the best prospects for ICT applications. Through this Communication, the Commission outlines its intention to support the development and as broad a dissemination as possible of these systems.      ICT in vehicles: a modern safety system      Accident prevention measures focused on the driver and the vehicle have led to a steady reduction of the number of fatalities on European roads. However, these "conventional" safety measures are reaching their limits. Bearing this in mind, the Commission emphasises the need to develop modern ICT-based safety systems.     In view of the progress already made in developing intelligent safety systems through research and technological development (RTD), the Commission intends to turn it into an area of priority action in RTD.     Intelligent car safety systems reduce the proportion of accidents due to the human factor (95%). These systems make use of ICT to provide solutions for improving road safety in particular in the pre-crash phase. These systems operate either autonomously on board the vehicle or co-operatively through vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. They make it possible to ensure safe speed, lane support, safe following, pedestrian protection, improved vision, driver monitoring and intersection safety. Their two major contributions are that they prevent collisions during lane changes or lane departure and provide vehicles with an automatic emergency call system (       eCall      ).      Support for the car industry      Because of the laws of the market and car manufacturers' need for profitability, the development and deployment of such large-scale intelligent safety systems cannot be left to the market alone. The fact is that these technologies place serious constraints on the car industry, entailing higher production costs, energy consumption and vehicle weight.     Moreover, developing integrated intelligent road safety systems requires the involvement of many other actors such as telecommunications operators, equipment manufacturers, service providers, motorway managers, road authorities, insurance companies, road safety organisations and user associations.     Against this background, it is the Commission's view that the European, national and regional public authorities should lend their support to the private sector (in particular to the car industry) to ensure the wide-spread sale and distribution of intelligent vehicles.     Public support can take various forms: promoting standardisation, launching awareness and information campaigns or providing financial incentives.      Actions envisaged by the Commission      To provide support, the Commission proposes actions in the following three categories:       promoting intelligent vehicle safety systems:       - continue support for the eSafety forum which is intended to become an autonomous platform;     - clearly defining the objectives and priorities of further RTD;     - designing new human-machine interaction devices;     - promoting an on-board automatic emergency call system (       eCall      ) as a harmonised and pan-European system similar to the E112 location-based emergency call number;     - closely monitoring progress made in the provision of real-time traffic and travel information (RTTI);       adapting the regulatory and standardisation provisions:       - removing legal barriers hampering time-limited use of short-range radar, in particular with regard to harmonised access to the radio spectrum in the EU;     - improving current legislation on EC vehicle type approval;     - inviting the European standardisation bodies to establish priorities and draw up a standardisation programme;       removing the societal and business obstacles:       - assessing the socio-economic benefits;     - supporting the compilation of the European code of good practice and carrying out cost-benefit analysis of intelligent car safety systems;     - promoting private and public sector road maps.     The Commission also intends to participate in the following actions       undertaken by the private sector      :      developing a methodology to assess the potential impact of introducing intelligent vehicle safety systems;       developing validation methodology and procedures for vehicles equipped with such systems;       defining, producing, maintaining and certifying a European digital map database with road safety attributes.      The Commission will support these activities through RTD financing instruments. The eSafety forum will monitor the implementation of the actions and recommendations of the working groups and submit reports on this activity.

   Turkey – Transport     Turkey – Transport     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM(2011) 666      final – SEC(2011) 1201 – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The       2011 Report      identifies progress made on transport matters, except in the railway sector. In the air transport sector, air safety remains compromised by the lack of communication between air traffic control centres in Turkey and the Republic of Cyprus.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission's words)      EU       transport      legislation aims at improving the functioning of the internal market by promoting safe, efficient and environment- and user-friendly transport services. The transport       acquis      covers the sectors of road transport, railways, aviation, maritime transport and inland waterways. It covers technical and safety standards, social conditions, the monitoring of state aid and market liberalisation in the context of the internal transport market.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      Some progress has been achieved in alignment of the       transport      sector, except for the railway sector. Alignment in maritime and land transport remains at an advanced level and air transport is following at a slower pace. The lack of communications between air traffic control centres in Turkey and the Republic of Cyprus continues to seriously compromise air safety. In the maritime sector, the Voluntary IMO Member State Audit Scheme is expected to create positive results for becoming a party to international conventions. The implementation capacity is limited, particularly for dangerous goods in land and maritime transport. Turkey has made progress in the area of Trans-European networks, in particular in the TEN transport area. Further efforts are needed as regards reliable transport data. There is also some progress to report in the TEN energy area.     RELATED ACTS      Commission Report [         COM(2010) 660        final – SEC(2010) 1327 – Not published in the Official Journal].      In its 2010 Report, the Commission noted improvements made by Turkey in order to align its legislation with the       acquis      in the fields of aviation, maritime transport and road transport. The country needed to continue in this direction, particularly with a view to improving rail market opening and safety.      Commission Report [         COM(2009) 533        final – SEC(2009) 1334 final – Not published in the Official Journal].       Commission Report [         COM(2008) 674        final – SEC(2008) 2699 final – Not published in the Official Journal].      The November 2008 Report noted limited progress, although alignment of legislation had progressed well in the road transport sector. Considerable efforts had still to be made in the area of road safety. Moreover, the country was still not a party to international agreements on air and maritime transport.      Commission Report [         COM(2007) 663        final – SEC(2007) 1436 final – Not published in the Official Journal].      In its November 2007 Report, the Commission reported uneven progress. While the road sector was partly in line with the       acquis      , no progress could be reported in the rail sector. As for the areas of maritime and air transport, Turkey was still not a full party to all relevant international conventions. The question of risks for aviation safety and that of restrictions on the free movement of goods had not yet been resolved.      Commission Report [         COM(2006) 649        final – SEC(2006) 1390 final – Not published in the Official Journal].      The November 2006 Report noted that legislative alignment was fairly advanced in the area of road transport, but uneven in the other sectors. Decisions on the structure of the railway sector were still outstanding. In the areas of maritime and air transport, the adoption of international agreements was not complemented by the transposition of the relevant       acquis      . Turkey had not removed all restrictions on the free movement of goods, including restrictions on the means of transport.      Commission Report [         COM(2005) 561        final – SEC(2005) 1426 final – Not published in the Official Journal].      The November 2005 Report noted the first real progress in aligning legislation and boosting Turkey’s administrative capacities in the transport sector. However, further efforts were needed to transpose and fully implement the       acquis      . This was particularly true of the rail, air and maritime sectors, in which the competent administrations needed to become more autonomous and effective. Lastly, Turkey needed to lift restrictions on the free circulation of goods affecting certain means of transport.      Commission Report [         COM(2004) 656        final – SEC(2004) 1201 final – Not published in the Official Journal].      The October 2004 Report noted that alignment of Turkish legislation with the Community transport       acquis      remained limited. Legislative and institutional reforms were needed to restructure the entire rail sector in line with the       acquis      . Besides the need for further legislative alignment, due emphasis should be given to the capacity to introduce competent administrations, in particular in the road transport sector.      Commission Report [         COM(2003) 676        final – SEC(2003) 1212 final – Not published in the Official Journal].      The November 2003 Report indicated that Turkey had made limited progress in transposing the transport       acquis      . Alignment of the legislation with the Community transport acquis remained very limited, and calls for the adoption of action plans remained unheeded. Legislative alignment with the       acquis      should start on maritime safety, as well as on road and rail transport.      Commission Report [         COM(2002) 700        final – SEC(2002) 1412 final – Not published in the Official Journal].      The October 2002 Report noted that progress had been limited. Turkey needed to focus further efforts on bringing its legislation into line with the Community transport       acquis      in all transport sectors. However, legislative preparation also needed to be accompanied by the means to implement and enforce the       acquis      .      Commission Report [         COM(2001) 700        final – SEC(2001) 1756 – Not published in the Official Journal].

summary of   A new start for jobs and growth in Greece – COM(2015) 400 final   summary    what does this communication do        —     Known as the Jobs and Growth Plan for Greece, it outlines an approach to help Greece maximise its use of EU funds up to 2020.            —     In that timeframe, the European Commission (EC) intends to work with the Greek authorities to mobilise up to €35 billion to help fund investment and economic activity, which is crucial in allowing Greece to return to economic growth.      key points         —     The €35 billion in EU funding available to Greece up to 2020 will come from the following:        —     the  European Regional Development Fund  (€8.4 billion);             —     the  Cohesion Fund  (€3.25 billion);             —     the  European Social Fund  (€3.7 billion);             —     the  Youth Employment Initiative  (€172 million);             —     the  Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived  (€281 million);             —     the  European Agricultural Guarantee Fund  (€15.1 billion);             —     the  European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development  (€4.7 billion); and             —     the  European Maritime and Fisheries Fund  (€389 million).                 —     Greece will also continue to benefit from EU programmes like  Horizon 2020  , which paid approximately €160 million towards financing Greek innovation projects in the first year of the 2014-20  timeframe.            —     As an exceptional measure and in light of Greece’s unique situation, the Commission proposes to improve immediate liquidity from EU funds so that investments can be made now, with their beneficial impact on growth and jobs.            —     The €35 billion will be used for:        —     investments for a wide range of sectors in the Greek economy;             —     fighting unemployment and poverty and improving social conditions;             —     improving research, innovation and education;             —     supporting agriculture and fisheries; and             —     energy, transport and environmental projects.                 —     Technical support for reforms and implementation will be provided by the European Commission’s  Structural Reform Support Service  , which was created to offer tailor-made technical support to EU countries.      background   Since the Greek government-debt crisis started in late 2009, Greek people have gone through extremely difficult times. The crisis has resulted in weak competitiveness, low productivity (due to a very high unemployment rate), and a very large public deficit. EU support is needed to help complete reforms in Greece, such as improving public administration; fighting corruption, money laundering and fraud; and improving healthcare. It is hoped that these reforms, together with new investments, will bring Greece back to economic prosperity.        —      Press release             —      European Commission — Statement       act   Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: A new start for jobs and growth in Greece (  COM(2015) 400 final  of 15.7.2015)
summary of   Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA — protection of personal data processed in the context of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters   what is the aim of this framework decision  It aims to protect people’s fundamental rights and freedoms when their personal data are processed for the purposes of preventing, investigating, detecting or prosecuting a criminal offence or of executing a criminal penalty.   key points    Scope    This framework decision concerns both personal data that are processed in part or entirely by automatic means (using information technology) and personal data that are part of a filing system and processed by non-automatic means (i.e. humans).    Data processing    The competent authorities of European Union (EU) countries may collect personal data only for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes. The processing of these data is permitted only for the purposes for which they were collected. Processing for other purposes is allowed only under certain circumstances or when certain appropriate safeguards are in place (e.g. such as making the data anonymous).   In principle, personal data that reveals a person’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership or concerns his/her health or sex life may not be processed. Their processing may be allowed only if it is absolutely necessary and if appropriate safeguards have been established.   Inaccurate personal data must be rectified and updated or completed if possible. Once the data are no longer needed for the purposes they were collected, they must be erased, made anonymous or, in certain cases, blocked. The need to store personal data must be reviewed regularly, with time limits set for their erasure.   EU countries’ competent authorities must verify that the personal data to be transmitted or made available are accurate, up to date and complete. In order to be able to verify that the processing of data is lawful and to ensure the integrity and security of the data, their transmissions must be logged or documented.    Data transmission    Personal data received from another EU country are to be processed only for the purposes for which they were transmitted. In certain cases, however, they may be processed for other purposes, for example for the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of other criminal offences, the execution of other criminal penalties or the prevention of threats to public security. The receiving EU country must respect any specific restrictions to the exchanges of data provided for in the law of the transmitting country.   Under certain circumstances, the receiving EU country may transfer personal data to non-EU countries or to international bodies. To this end, the EU country that first made the data available must provide its consent. Only in urgent cases may data be transferred without prior consent. Personal data may also be transferred to private parties in EU countries for exclusive purposes, provided that the competent authority of the country from where the data was received has given its consent.    Rights of data subjects    The data subject is to be kept informed of any collection or processing of personal data relating to him/her. However, when data have been transmitted from one EU country to another, the first may demand that the second does not divulge any information to the subject.   The data subject may request to receive a confirmation on   whether their data have been transmitted,   who the recipients are, what data are being processed, as well as a   confirmation that the necessary verifications of that data have been made.     In certain cases, EU countries may restrict the subject’s access to information. Any decision restricting access must be given in writing to the data subject, together with the factual and legal reasons thereof. The data subject must also be given advice on their right to appeal such a decision.   The data subject may demand that personal data relating to him/her be rectified, erased or blocked. Any refusal to that end must be given in writing, along with information on the right to lodge a complaint or seek a judicial remedy.   Any person may demand compensation for the damages they have suffered due to an unlawful processing of personal data or any other act that is not compatible with this framework decision. Where a data subject’s rights are breached, they have the right to a judicial remedy.    Safeguarding data processing    The competent authorities must take the necessary security measures to protect personal data against any unlawful form of processing. This includes accidental loss, alteration and unauthorised disclosure of, as well as access to, personal data. In particular, specific measures need to be taken with regard to the automated processing of data.   National supervisory authorities in EU countries monitor and advise on the application of this framework decision. To that end, they are granted investigative powers, effective powers of intervention, as well as the power to pursue legal proceedings. For any infringements of the provisions of this framework decision, EU countries must establish effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties.    Repeal   Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA is repealed by Directive (EU)  2016/680  with effect from 6 May 2018.   from when does the framework decision apply  It has applied since 19 January 2009.   background   For more information, see:    Protection of personal data  on the European Commission’s website.
summary of   Judgment of the Court — Joined Cases C-293/12 and C-594/12 concerning the EU data retention directive   what is the effect of this judgment  In its judgment, the  Court of Justice of the European Union  declared as invalid  Directive 2006/24/EC  on the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the supply of publicly available electronic communications services or networks.   key points    The Court notes that the directive permits the retention of data that may  provide very precise information on the private lives of the persons whose data are retained  (e.g. on their daily routine, permanent or temporary places of residence, movements, activities, relationships and the social environments frequented).   The Court takes the view that, by requiring the retention of those data and by allowing the competent national authorities to access them, the directive  interferes  in a particularly serious manner with the  fundamental rights  to respect private life and to protect personal data.   While not disputing the aim of the directive, the Court recalls that it must be taken into account that  measures must be proportionate  with what is strictly necessary to protect the general interest from serious threats (such as the  fight against terrorism  or  organised crime  ).   In particular, the Court criticises the fact that the directive:   covers, in a  generalised manner  , all individuals, all means of electronic communication and all traffic data without any differentiation, limitation or exception being made in the light of the objective of fighting against serious crime;   imposes a period of at least 6 months,  without making any distinction  between the categories of data based on the persons concerned or their possible usefulness in relation to the objective pursued;   does not provide for  sufficient safeguards  to ensure effective protection of the data against the  risk of abuse  and against any  unlawful access or use  ;   does not require that the data be retained within the EU and does not fully ensure the  control of compliance  on the basis of EU law.     background   The High Court (Ireland) and the  Verfassungsgerichtshof  (Constitutional Court, Austria) asked the Court of Justice to examine the validity of the Data Retention Directive, in particular in the light of 2 fundamental rights under the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU: to  respect private life  and to  protect personal data  .
   Partnership for the accession of Lithuania     Partnership for the accession of Lithuania     The aim of the Accession Partnership is to assist the authorities in the candidate country in their efforts to comply with the accession criteria. It covers in detail the priorities for accession preparations, in particular implementing the acquis, and forms the basis for programming pre-accession assistance from Community funds such as the Phare programme. Following the signing of the Accession Treaty on 16 April 2003 and the official integration of the country into the European Union on 1 May 2004, the accession partnership has come to an end.     In its communication "       Agenda 2000      ", the European Commission has set out a range of proposals for strengthening the pre-accession strategy for all the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The general objective of this strategy is to offer a coherent programme for preparing these countries for membership of the European Union, and more particularly:      to bring together the various forms of aid offered by the European Union within a single framework, the accession partnerships;       to familiarise applicants with the European Union's procedures and policies by offering them the opportunity to participate in Community programmes.      1) OBJECTIVE     The objective of the partnership for accession (adopted in March 1998 and amended in December 1999 and in January 2002) is to provide a legal framework for the working priorities set out in the Commission's opinion on Lithuania's application for membership, the financial resources available to help Lithuania implement these priorities and the conditions which apply to this aid. The partnership underpins a range of instruments to support candidate countries in the accession process.     These include a national programme for adopting the Community acquis (PNAA) (revised in February 2002), joint evaluation of medium-term economic priorities, the pact against organised crime, the national development plan and other sectoral programmes required for participation in post-accession structural funds and pre-accession implementation of       ISPA      and       SAPARD      . In 2002, the partnership for accession served as the starting point for preparing an action plan to reinforce the administrative and judicial capacity of Lithuania.     Although these instruments will not form an integral part of the partnership their priorities will be compatible.     The implementation of the partnership for accession will be monitored under the Europe Agreement between the European Union and Lithuania.     2) PRIORITIES     These are divided into two groups: short- and medium-term priorities. The priority issues in the first group are those Lithuania was likely to tackle or complete during 2000. Those in the second group should be settled by the end of 2003.     Lithuania has largely achieved the political and economic criteria priorities. The same is true for those relating to the free movement of goods, company law, competition, statistics, employment and social policy, energy, the environment, consumer protection and health. Most of the other priorities have been partly achieved.     The accession partnership priorities were reviewed in December 1999 (see point 3 of the Annex to Decision       1999/856/EC)      . The most recent review was published in February 2002 (Decision 2002/89/EC). This forms the basis of the Commission report for 2002.     The priority areas are:     (for up-to-date information on this subject, please refer to the Adoption of the Community acquis section)       Economic reform         Strengthening institutional and administrative capacities         Internal market         Justice and home affairs         Environment         Energy         Economic policy         Agriculture - Fisheries         Transport         Employment and social affairs         Regional policy and cohesion       3) FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK      Phare      EUR 38.3 million was allocated under the 2000       Phare programme      for Lithuania. A further EUR 1 million was earmarked for cross-border cooperation. This included a support mechanism for small cooperation projects in the Baltic region. Lithuania was granted EUR 45.5 million under Phare 2001. A further EUR 3 million were set aside for Baltic crossborder cooperation. Phare 2002 allocated EUR 43.7 million to Lithuania, plus a further EUR 18.5 million under the facility specified by the programme to strengthen the country's institutions. An amount of EUR 3 million for cross-border cooperation was also agreed for Lithuania.     Up to 2006, the Commission has promised to allocate financial aid to the tune of EUR 165 million for the decommissioning of the Ignalina nuclear power plant. Most of this aid will be provided by the international support fund for the decommissioning of Ignalina, set up in June 2000 and managed by the EBRD. An initial protocol for EUR 10 million was allocated in 1999, EUR 35 million in 2000 and EUR 55 million in 2001.     The Lithuanian authorities are assuming responsibility for aid contracts and payments. However, the European Communities' Financial Regulation requires the Commission to oversee contract award procedures and to approve any Phare-funded contract signed by the partner country before it comes into effect.      Pre-accession Aid      Aid for agriculture and rural development (       SAPARD      ) and a structural instrument (       ISPA      ) giving priority to aid in the transport and environmental sectors will be introduced in 2000. The Regulation coordinating aid under Phare, SAPARD and ISPA was adopted in June 1999. It enables the Commission to carry out ex post monitoring of contracts where it considers financial control in the partner country to be deficient.     The total financial aid made available between 2000 and 2002 was EUR 126 million for Phare, EUR 90 million for SAPARD and approximately EUR 155 million for ISPA. SAPARD 2002 allocated an indicative envelope of EUR 31.3 million to Lithuania, and that from ISPA was between EUR 44 and 65 million.     4) REFERENCES      Council Decision         98/265/EC        of 30 March 1998Official Journal L 121 of 23.04.1998       Council Decision         1999/856/EC        of 6 December 1999Official Journal L 335 of 28.12.1999       Commission Opinion COM(97)2007 finalNot published in the Official Journal       Commission Report COM(98) 706 finalNot published in the Official Journal       Commission Report COM(1999) 507 finalNot published in the Official Journal       Commission Report COM(2000) 707 finalNot published in the Official Journal       Commission Report COM(2001) 700 final - SEC(2001) 1750Not published in the Official Journal       Decision 2002/89/EC of 28.01.2002Official Journal L 44 of 14.02.2002       Commission Report COM(2002) 700 final      -       SEC(2002) 1406Not published in the Official Journal       Treaty of Accession to the European Union [Official Journal L 236, 23.09.2003]      Last updated: 19.11.2004  
summary of   Regulation (EU) 2015/1843 — International trade rules: how the EU can exercise its rights   summary    what does this regulation do   It sets out procedures enabling EU industry and countries to ask the EU institutions to examine any alleged trade barriers put in place by non-EU countries that are contrary to international trade rules.   It seeks to find a solution to any obstacle to trade and to eliminate injury (e.g. reduced profit margins in the EU market) or adverse trade effects (e.g. economic losses on export markets) resulting from such barriers.   key points    Who may complain?   Any EU person, company or association claiming to have suffered injury or adverse trade effects due to trade obstacles may submit a written complaint to the EU. EU countries may also submit one. It must show sufficient evidence of the existence of the trade obstacles and of the resulting injury/adverse trade effects.   Complaint procedures   Complaints must be sent to the  European Commission  . The Commission must inform complainants and EU countries if there is insufficient evidence to justify further investigation. A decision must generally be taken within 45 days of the complaint being lodged.   Further examination procedure   Where the Commission considers that sufficient evidence of injury exists, it may carry out a further examination. It must announce this in the EU’s Official Journal. It may seek additional information from relevant parties (e.g. competitors of the complainant) and carry out investigations in non-EU countries.  The complainants, relevant exporters and importers and EU countries have the right to inspect all information provided to the Commission and to be kept informed of all key facts. The Commission must submit a final report within 5 months, in complex cases within 7 months, to an advisory committee made up of representatives of EU countries.   Termination and suspension   When, as a result of the investigation, the Commission concludes that no further action is needed, it may close the investigation. When the Commission considers that the non-EU countries concerned have adopted measures to address the alleged trade barriers, it may suspend the procedure.   Further action to remove injury/trade obstacles   Where the Commission finds that further action is needed in order to remove the injury and/or relevant trade obstacle, it may take specific actions. These actions may include:   preferably finding a mutually acceptable solution with the relevant non-EU country;   initiating a dispute settlement proceeding under the  World Trade Organization  or the relevant bilateral trade agreement;   suspending any trade concessions with the relevant countries;   imposing or increasing customs duties on imports;   introducing restrictions on imports or exports from the non-EU country concerned.   from when does the regulation apply  It applies from 5 November 2015.   background    ‘Trade barrier investigations’  on the European Commission’s website   act   Regulation (EU)  2015/1843  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 October 2015 laying down Union procedures in the field of the common commercial policy in order to ensure the exercise of the Union’s rights under international trade rules, in particular those established under the auspices of the World Trade Organization (codification) (OJ L 272, 16.10.2015, pp. 1-13)
summary of   Directive 2009/24/EC — the legal protection of computer programs   what is the aim of the directive  It aims to clarify and remove differences between the legal protection of computer programs in different European Union (EU) countries in order to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal market.   key points    EU countries must protect computer programs by  copyright  .   Programs should be protected as literary works, within the meaning of the  Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.    Computer programs include their preparatory design material.    Scope   The protection provided for in this directive applies to:   the  expression  of a computer program in any form, but not  ideas and principles which underlie  a computer program or any elements of it;   a computer program which is original in the sense that it is the  author’s own intellectual creation  ;   computer programs created before 1 January 1993, without prejudice to any acts concluded and rights acquired before that date.    Authorship    The author of a computer program is the  person or group of people  who have created the program or, where national legislation permits, a  legal person,  i.e. a company or other legal entity.   If several persons participate in creating a program, the exclusive rights are held jointly by these persons.   If an  employee  creates a computer program in the course of his duties or following the instructions given by his employer, the  employer  exclusively has the economic rights relating to that computer program.    Exclusive rights of the rights-holder   The holder of the rights to a computer program may do, or may authorise others to do, the following:   the permanent or temporary  reproduction  of the program, or a part thereof;   the translation, adaptation, arrangement and any other alteration of the program;   the  distribution  of the programme.    Limitations of those exclusive rights (no need for prior authorisation from the rights-holder)    A lawful acquirer of a program may reproduce, translate, adapt, arrange or alter the program, when it is necessary in order to use the program in accordance with its intended purpose.   A person having a right to use the computer program may make a  back-up copy  in so far as it is necessary for that use.   This person may also observe, study or test the functioning of the program in order to determine the ideas and principles which underlie any element of the program.    Decompilation   *   Prior authorisation from the rights-holder is not required where reproduction of the code and translation of its form are essential to obtain information necessary to achieve the  interoperability   *  of a new computer program with other programs.  The following conditions apply:   those acts are performed by the  licensee  or another person having a right to use a copy of a program;   the information on interoperability has not previously been readily available;   those acts are confined to the parts of the original program which are necessary in order to achieve interoperability.    Special measures of protection   Measures must be taken by EU countries against persons who commit any of the following:   putting into circulation an  infringing copy  of a computer program;   possession of an infringing copy of a program for  commercial purposes  ;   putting into circulation or owning, for commercial purposes, any means whose sole purpose is to allow the unauthorised removal or bypassing of any  technical protection device.    An infringing copy of a computer program may be seized in accordance with EU countries’ national laws.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 25 May 2009. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 31 December 1992, the date indicated in the  Directive 91/250/EEC  that is  codified  by Directive 2009/24/EC.   background   For more information, see:    Protection of computer programs    * key terms     Decompilation:  the conversion of program code into a higher-level programming language that can be read by a human.     Interoperability:  the ability of a system or product to work with other systems or products without the need for any further action on the part of the consumer.
summary of   Regulation (EC) No 458/2007 on the European system of integrated social protection statistics (ESSPROS)   what is the aim of the regulation  It establishes the European system of integrated social protection statistics (  ESSPROS  ). This system provides legal rules intended to improve the usefulness of current data collections in terms of timeliness, coverage and comparability.   key points   This regulation puts in place a European system of integrated social protection statistics, referred to as ESSPROS. It provides for:   a set of rules, based on common standards, definitions, classifications and accounting rules, to be used for compiling statistics on a comparable basis for the benefit of the EU;   time limits for the transmission of the statistics compiled.   The statistics relating to the ESSPROS core system shall cover the financial flows on social protection expenditure and receipts (quantitative and qualitative data). They concern the different social protection schemes.  In addition to the core system, modules covering supplementary statistical information on particular aspects of social protection have been added.   Scope of the system   ESSPROS covers statistics concerning the financial flows of social security expenditure and receipts.  Data are being collected starting from the year 2008 as reference period.   Module on pension beneficiaries   A module on pension beneficiaries was to be added to the core system starting from 2008 as reference period.   Additional modules   In order to introduce a module on  net social protection benefits   *  , pilot data collections for the year 2005 were to be carried out in all EU countries by the end of 2008.  Based on a synthesis of these national pilot data collections, a decision was to be taken to introduce this module and to launch full data collection, but not before 2010.   Data sources   The statistics must be based on registers and other administrative sources, surveys and estimates, according to their availability in the EU countries and in accordance with national laws and practices.   Arrangements for implementation   The  European Commission  has adopted specific regulations to implement the ESPROSS regulation. These concern:   formats for  transmission  , results to be transmitted and criteria for measuring  quality  for the ESSPROS core system and the module on pension beneficiaries (Regulation (EC) No  1322/2007  ) and for the module on net social protection benefits (Regulation (EU) No  110/2011  );   the  definitions, detailed classifications  and  updating  of the rules for dissemination for the ESSPROS core system and the module on pension beneficiaries (Regulation (EC) No  10/2008  );    launch of full data collection  for the ESSPROS module on net social protection benefits (Regulation (EU) No  263/2011  ).   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 20 May 2007.   background   For more information, see:    European system of integrated social protection statistics  (  Eurostat  ).   key terms    Social protection benefits:  transfers, in cash or in kind, by social protection schemes to households and individuals to relieve them of the burden of one or more risks or needs such as:   sickness and/or healthcare,   disability,   old age,   unemployment,   housing and   social exclusion.    Net social protection benefits take into account the value of these benefits after any taxes and social contributions paid by the recipient.
   Improving the economic situation in the fishing industry     Improving the economic situation in the fishing industry     This Communication describes the sources of economic difficulties facing the fishing industry at the moment. To meet these challenges, the Communication suggests a number of different measures. In the short term, it explains how the Commission will apply the "Guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty" to the fishing sector. In the long term, it recommends improving fisheries management, better compliance with fisheries management rules, more efficient operation of the market and making optimum use of research.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 9March 2006 on improving the economic situation in the fishing industry [       COM(2006) 103      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     In the last few years, the economic situation of many fishing businesses has deteriorated as a result of:     Stagnating or even falling market prices, partly owing to an increase in imports and the development of aquaculture, but primarily because of the concentration of sales in big distribution chains and greater competition between fish and other food products.     Lower fishing yields, because the reduction in fishing capacity has not kept pace with the reduction in fishing quotas for the main demersal and benthic species since the mid 1990s. Reducing vessel tonnage and engine power has failed to stabilise the situation, as this reduction has been offset by the steady increase in the efficiency of fishing vessels, resulting in widespread overfishing. According to an assessment carried out by the       International Council for the Exploration of the Sea      (ICES), for most of the stocks assessed, overfishing is running at two to five times the level that would generate the maximum sustainable yield.       *      An increase in fuel prices between 2003 and 2005, which particularly affected vessels with towed gear. Fuel costs can account for as much as 36 % of the value of landings and can mean operating at a loss. Consequently, crew members who are paid a share of the income generated by the catch have also suffered a loss of income.     At the moment, businesses targeting demersal species and using towed gear are hardest hit.     In the short term, Member States could help fishing businesses facing difficulties by granting aid in accordance with the       Guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty      .      Rescue aid      Rescue aid is intended solely to keep an ailing business financially afloat for long enough to give it time to look into the possibility of restructuring. It must last no longer than six months, and takes the form of a loan or guarantee, which may be repaid using the support subsequently received in the form of restructuring aid.      Restructuring aid      The       Guidelines for the examination of State aid to fisheries and aquaculture      allow State aid for modifying, modernising and equipping fishing vessels, subject to the       same conditions      that apply to Community aid granted under the       FIFG      .     Other types of aid for modernising and equipping fishing vessels may be allowed in accordance with the Community Guidelines on State aid to firms in difficulty. However, Member States would have to obtain the Commission's approval for this. Aid should be limited to the minimum necessary, and restructuring must be based on realistic economic assumptions, which form the starting point for a restructuring plan. Furthermore, profitability must be ensured by reducing costs without increasing current overall fishing effort or capacity. The Commission will assess aid for the following investments in fishing vessels on the basis of the extent to which they contribute towards re-establishing the viability of the business concerned:      Changing fishing gear for the first time, resulting in a switch to a less fuel-intensive gear;       Purchasing equipment to improve fuel efficiency;       Replacing the engine with a new engine, which, depending on the size of the vessel and the fishing method, must be either of equal power or less powerful. For trawlers of more than 24 m in overall length, this must be accompanied by a switch to a new, less fuel-intensive fishing method. The Commission will verify the power of new engines of more than 130 kW on the basis of the "NOx certificate". Any reduction in engine power funded by public aid will be deducted from the national fleet capacity ceilings. If a business operates several vessels, the Commission may agree to apply the reduction in engine power to that business as a whole. Similarly, where national schemes allow for the implementation of a restructuring plan put forward by a group of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the Commission may decide to apply the reduction to the group as a whole.      During the time needed to implement these investments on board fishing vessels, State aid for temporary cessation of activities is also allowed. Direct aid to subsidise fuel costs would constitute operating aid, which is incompatible with the Treaty. The fishing sector could, however, set up a contingency fund, but for this fund to be approved by the Commission, guarantees would have to be provided that all public aid would be reimbursed.     Member States should notify the Commission of planned rescue and restructuring aid schemes within two years of the publication of the Communication. The Commission will examine them as soon as possible on the basis of the relevant provisions of the applicable Structural Funds. Within two years of the Commission's approval of a scheme, Member States should issue their administrative decisions.     In the long term, further action is needed to ensure the recovery of fish stocks and build a positive future for the fishing industry.      Improving fisheries management      Fisheries management could be further improved by:      Moving towards maximum sustainable yields (MSY). MSYs were adopted by the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development as a way of achieving stable management of fish stocks by 2015. Furthermore, they would bring economic benefits in terms of predictability of supply and revenue per unit of effort. Since         the 2002 reform        of the common fisheries policy (CFP), one of its aims has been the recovery of threatened stocks, which is a prerequisite for managing all of the major fisheries at MSY levels (see the Communication on the implementation of MSYs).       Ensuring economic management of fisheries. The Commission will publish a         Communication on the bearing that the methods used by Member States to allocate fishing rights have on the economic situation of the fleet.        Improving governance of the CFP. The 2002 reform of the CFP provided for setting up Regional Advisory Councils (RACs) in order to achieve better compliance with the rules by increasing stakeholders' involvement in fisheries management. So far, three RACs have been set up and a fourth is in the process of being set up. In 2007, the Commission will look at how to improve the functioning of the RACs.       Matching fishing effort to available resources. Overcapacity contributes to overfishing and reduces profitability, which is why it is necessary to decommission some vessels. A number of Member States have already set up decommissioning schemes. Both national and Community aid may be granted for decommissioning fishing vessels or reassigning them to other activities. Member States and the Community should also use the European Fisheries Fund (         EFF        ) for this purpose.       Better compliance with fisheries management rules      In order to ensure fair competition, conservation of resources and the quality of the scientific advice on which the CFP is based, it is important that all fishermen comply with the rules. Steps should be taken to:      Strengthen controls. The new         Fisheries Control Agency        will verify that Member States are implementing fishing Regulations across the European Union (EU).       Step up the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, which some operators have adopted as a commercial strategy. The Commission will ensure that its         action plan        is implemented in order to deprive these operators of their gains from IUU fishing.       Improving the operation of the market      In order to give fishermen more added value, the Commission will look at new tools to improve the marketing of fish and fish products. It will also ask the       Advisory Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture      to draw up a code of conduct for trade within the EU. Eco-labelling schemes could also promote sustainable fishing. The Commission's recent       Communication      on this subject should encourage fruitful debate. Member States should use the EFF to improve the quality, added value and marketing of fish products.      Research into sustainable fishing      The Commission will ensure that the annual programmes adopted to implement the       Seventh Framework Programme      support:      Optimising, validating and demonstrating new concepts and new technologies which will enable energy savings to be made.       Designing more fuel-efficient fishing gear.       Generating renewable energy.       Developing and demonstrating new types of biofuels.       Funding      The EFF is available to Member States within the framework of their rescue and restructuring schemes, as well as to help finance fleet adjustment measures and support the necessary social changes in the affected fishing communities. Member States should distribute the financial resources among the different EFF funding priorities, while ensuring that the necessary funds are allocated to fleet adjustment measures in view of the gravity of the economic situation.      Background      Rising fuel prices, coupled with declining fish stocks, have reduced the profitability of the fleet. The Communication identifies the main factors contributing to the economic crisis in the sector, and suggests both short-term and long-term responses to improve the economic situation for fishing businesses by promoting measures designed to restore the balance between fishing capacity and fishing opportunities.       Key terms used in the act         Maximum sustainable yield: the maximum catch rate that will ensure sustainable fishing.

   Partnership for the accession of Latvia     Partnership for the accession of Latvia     The aim of the Accession Partnership is to assist the authorities in the candidate country in their efforts to comply with the accession criteria. It covers in detail the priorities for accession preparations, in particular implementing the acquis, and forms the basis for programming pre-accession assistance from Community funds such as the Phare programme. Following the signing of the Accession Treaty on 16 April 2003 and the official integration of the country into the European Union on 1 May 2004, the accession partnership has come to an end.     In its communication "       Agenda 2000      ", the European Commission has set out a range of proposals for strengthening the pre-accession strategy for all the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The general objective of this strategy is to offer a coherent programme for preparing these countries for membership of the European Union, and more particularly:      to bring together the various forms of aid offered by the European Union within a single framework, the accession partnerships;       to familiarise applicants with the European Union's procedures and policies by offering them the opportunity to participate in Community programmes.      1) OBJECTIVE     The objective of the partnership for accession adopted in March 1998 and amended in December 1999 and in January 2002 is to provide a legal framework for the working priorities set out in the Commission's opinion on Latvia's application for membership, the financial resources available to help Latvia implement these priorities and the conditions which apply to this aid. The partnership underpins a range of instruments to support candidate countries in the accession process.     These instruments include a national programme for adopting the Community acquis (revised in April 2002), joint evaluation of medium-term economic priorities, a pact against organised crime, the national development plan and other sectoral programmes required for participation in the Structural Funds after accession and pre-accession implementation of       ISPA      and       SAPARD      . In 2002, the partnership for accession served as the starting point for preparing an action plan to reinforce the administrative and judicial capacity of Latvia.     Although these instruments will not form an integral part of the partnership their priorities will be compatible.     The implementation of the partnership for accession will be monitored under the Europe Agreement between the European Union and Latvia.     2) PRIORITIES     These are divided into two groups: short- and medium-term priorities. The priority issues in the first group were those likely to be tackled or completed by Latvia during 2000. Those in the second group should be settled by the end of 2003.     Latvia has achieved the priorities relating to economic criteria, free movement of persons, free movement of goods, free movement of capital and statistics. In most areas the priorities have been partly achieved.     The accession partnership priorities were reviewed in December 1999 (see point 3 of the Annex to Decision       1999/854/EC)      . The most recent review was published in February 2002 (Decision 2002/88/EC). This forms the basis of the Commission's 2002 report.     The priority areas are:     (for up-to-date information on this subject, please refer to the Adoption of the Community acquis section)       Political criteria         Economic reform         Strengthening institutional and administrative capacities         Internal market         Justice and home affairs         Environment         Economic policy         Agriculture - Fisheries         Transport         Employment and social affairs         Regional policy and cohesion       3) FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK      Phare      The 2001       Phare programme      for Latvia allocated EUR 31.4 million for the national programme. A further EUR 3 million were set aside for the Baltic cross-border cooperation programme. Phare 2002 allocated EUR 27 million to Latvia, plus EUR 5 million under the additional financing mechanism to strengthen the institutions. A further EUR 3 million were earmarked for the Baltic cross-border cooperation programme.     The Latvian authorities are assuming responsibility for aid contracts and payments. However, the European Communities' Financial Regulation requires the Commission to oversee contract award procedures and to approve any Phare-funded contract signed by the partner country before it comes into effect.      Pre-accession aid      Aid for agriculture and rural development (       SAPARD      ) and a structural instrument (       ISPA      ) giving priority to aid in the transport and environmental sectors will be introduced in 2000. The Regulation coordinating aid under Phare, SAPARD and ISPA was adopted in June 1999. It enables the Commission to carry out ex post monitoring of contracts where it considers financial control in the partner country to be deficient.     The total financial aid made available between 2000 and 2002 was EUR 90 million for Phare, EUR 66 million for SAPARD and between EUR 105 and EUR 165 million for ISPA. Annually, this amounted to EUR 35 million from Phare, EUR 22.2 million from SAPARD and between EUR 36.4 and 57.2 million from ISPA. For Latvia, the indicative envelope for SAPARD 2002 was EUR 22.9 million. For ISPA this was between EUR 38.1 and 59.9 million.     In 2002, in order to support the efforts of the countries negotiating accession to the Union, the Commission provided special financial aid amounting to EUR 250 million.     4) REFERENCES      Council Decision         98/263/EC        of 30 March 1998Official Journal L 121 of 23.04.1998       Council Decision         1999/854/EC        of 6 December 1999Official Journal L 335 of 28.12.1999       Commission Opinion COM(97) 2005 finalNot published in the Official Journal       Commission Report COM(98) 704 finalNot published in the Official Journal       Commission Report COM(1999) 506 finalNot published in the Official Journal       Commission Report COM(2000) 706 finalNot published in the Official Journal       Commission Report COM(2001) 700 final - SEC(2001)1749Not published in the Official Journal       Decision 2002/88/EC of 28.01.2002Official Journal L 44, 14.02.2002       Commission Report COM(2002) 700 final - SEC(2002) 1405Not published in the Official Journal       Treaty of Accession to the European Union [Official Journal L 236, 23.09.2003]      Last updated: 19.11.2004  
   White paper: European transport policy for 2010     White paper: European transport policy for 2010     This document aims to strike a balance between economic development and the quality and safety demands made by society in order to develop a modern, sustainable transport system for 2010.     ACT     White Paper submitted by the Commission on 12 September 2001: "European transport policy for 2010: time to decide" [       COM(2001) 370      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The Commission has proposed 60 or so measures to develop a transport system capable of shifting the balance between modes of transport, revitalising the railways, promoting transport by sea and inland waterway and controlling the growth in air transport. In this way, the       White Paper      fits in with the sustainable development strategy adopted by the European Council in Gothenburg in June 2001.     The European Community found it difficult to implement the common transport policy provided for by the Treaty of Rome. The Treaty of Maastricht therefore reinforced the political, institutional and budgetary foundations for transport policy, inter alia by introducing the concept of the trans-European network (TEN).     The Commission's first White Paper on the future development of the common transport policy, published in December 1992, put the accent on opening up the transport market. Ten years later, road cabotage has become a reality, air safety standards in the European Union are now the best in the world and personal mobility has increased from 17 km a day in 1970 to 35 km in 1998. In this context, the research       framework programmes      have been developing the most modern techniques to meet two major challenges: the trans-European high-speed rail network and the       Galileo      satellite navigation programme.     However, the more or less rapid implementation of Community decisions according to modes of transport explains the existence of certain difficulties, such as:      unequal growth in the different modes of transport. Road now takes 44% of the goods transport market compared with 8% for rail and 4% for inland waterways. On the passenger transport market, road accounts for 79%, air for 5% and rail for 6%;       congestion on the main road and rail routes, in cities and at certain airports;       harmful effects on the environment and public health and poor road safety.      Economic development combined with enlargement of the European Union could exacerbate these trends.     Road transport     - Objectives: To improve quality, apply existing regulations more effectively by tightening up controls and penalties.     - Figures: For carriage of goods and passengers, road transport dominates as it carries 44% of freight and 79% of passenger traffic. Between 1970 and 2000, the number of cars in the European Union trebled from 62.5 million to nearly 175 million.     - Problems: Road haulage is one of the sectors targeted because the forecasts for 2010 point to a 50% increase in freight transport. Despite their capacity to carry goods all over the European Union with unequalled flexibility and at an acceptable price, some small haulage companies are finding it difficult to stay profitable. Congestion is increasing even on the major roads and road transport alone accounts for 84% of CO2 emissions attributable to transport.     - Measures proposed: The Commission has proposed:      to harmonise         driving times        , with an average working week of not more than 48 hours (except for self-employed drivers);       to harmonise the national weekend bans on lorries;       to introduce a         driver attestation        making it possible to check that the driver is lawfully employed;       to develop vocational training;       to promote uniform road transport legislation;       to harmonise penalties and the conditions for immobilising vehicles;       to increase the number of checks;       to encourage exchanges of information;       to improve road safety and halve the number of road deaths by 2010;       to harmonise fuel taxes for commercial road users in order to reduce distortion of competition on the liberalised road transport market.      Rail transport     - Objectives: To revitalise the railways by creating an integrated, efficient, competitive and safe railway area and to set up a network dedicated to freight services.     - Figures: Between 1970 and 1998 the share of the goods market carried by rail in Europe fell from 21% to 8.4%, whereas it is still 40% in the USA. At the same time, passenger traffic by rail increased from 217 billion passenger/kilometres in 1970 to 290 billion in 1998. In this context, 600 km of railway lines are closed each year.     - Problems: The White Paper points to the lack of infrastructure suitable for modern services, the lack of interoperability between networks and systems, the constant search for innovative technologies and, finally, the shaky reliability of the service, which is failing to meet customers' expectations. However, the success of new high-speed rail services has resulted in a significant increase in long-distance passenger transport.     - Measures proposed: The European Commission has adopted a second "       railway package      " consisting of five liberalisation and technical harmonisation measures intended for revitalising the railways by rapidly constructing an integrated European railway area. These five new proposals set out:      to develop a common approach to rail safety with the objective of gradually integrating the national safety systems;       to bolster the measures of         interoperability        in order to operate transfrontier services and cut costs on the high-speed network;       to set up an effective steering body - the         European Railway Agency        - responsible for safety and interoperability;       to extend and speed up opening of the rail freight market in order to open up the national freight markets;       to join the Intergovernmental Organisation for International Carriage by Rail (         OTIF        ).      This "railway package" will have to be backed up by other measures announced in the White Paper, particularly:      ensuring high-quality rail services;       removing barriers to entry to the rail freight market;       improving the environmental performance of rail freight services;       gradually setting up a dedicated rail freight network;       progressively opening up the market in passenger services by rail;       improving rail passengers' rights.      Air transport     - Objectives: To control the growth in air transport, tackle saturation of the skies, maintain safety standards and protect the environment.     - Figures: The proportion of passenger transport accounted for by air is set to double from 4% to 8% between 1990 and 2010. Air transport produces 13% of all CO2 emissions attributed to transport. Delays push up fuel consumption by 6%.     - Problems: To sustain such growth, air traffic management will need to be reformed and airport capacity improved in the European Union.       Eurocontrol      (the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation) is limited by a decision-making system based on consensus.     - Measures proposed: Creation of the       Single European Sky      is one of the current priorities, due to the following measures:      a regulatory framework based on common rules on         use of airspace        ;       joint civil/military management of air traffic;       dialogue with the social partners to reach agreements between the organisations concerned;       cooperation with Eurocontrol;       a surveillance, inspection and penalties system ensuring effective enforcement of the rules.      Besides this restructuring of the airspace, the Commission wishes to harmonise the qualifications for air traffic controllers by introducing a Community licence for air traffic controllers.     Alongside creation of the single sky, more efficient use of airport capacity implies defining a new regulatory framework covering:      the amendment of         slot allocation        in 2003. Airport slots grant the right to take off or land at a specific time at an airport. The Commission will propose new rules on this subject ;       an adjustment of airport charges to encourage the redistribution of flights throughout the day;       rules to limit the adverse impact on the environment. The air industry must get to grips with problems such as the         noise        generated by airports. The European Union must take account of the international commitments entered into within the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). With this in mind, the European Commission recently adopted a proposal for a directive to ban the noisiest aircraft from airports in Europe. In 2002 the ICAO will have to take specific measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Consideration is also being given to taxes on kerosene and the possibility of applying VAT to air tickets;       intermodality with rail to make the two modes complementary, particularly when the alternative of a high-speed train connection exists;       establishment of a European Aviation Safety Authority (EASA) to maintain high safety standards;       reinforcement of         passenger rights        , including the possibility of compensation when travellers are delayed or         denied boarding        .      Sea and inland waterway transport     - Objectives: To develop the infrastructure, simplify the regulatory framework by creating one-stop offices and integrate the social legislation in order to build veritable "motorways of the sea".     - Figures: Since the beginning of the 1980s, the European Union has lost 40% of its seamen. For all that, ships carry 70% of all trade between the Union and the rest of the world. Each year, some two billion tonnes of goods pass through European ports.     - Problems: Transport by sea and transport by inland waterway are a truly competitive alternative to transport by land. They are reliable, economical, clean and quiet. However, their capacity remains underused. Better use could be made of the inland waterways in particular. In this context, a number of infrastructure problems remain, such as bottlenecks, inappropriate gauges, bridge heights, operation of locks, lack of transhipment equipment, etc.     - Measures proposed: Transport by sea and transport by inland waterway are a key part of intermodality, they allow a way round bottlenecks between France and Spain in the Pyrenees or between Italy and the rest of Europe in the Alps, as well as between France and the United Kingdom and, looking ahead, between Germany and Poland.     The Commission has proposed a new legislative framework for ports which is designed:      to lay down new, clearer rules on pilotage, cargo-handling, stevedoring, etc.;       to simplify the rules governing operation of ports themselves and bring together all the links in the logistics chain (consignors, shipowners, carriers, etc.) in a one-stop shop.      On the inland waterways, the objectives are:      to eliminate bottlenecks;       to standardise technical specifications;       to harmonise pilots' certificates and the rules on rest times;       to develop navigational aid systems.      Intermodality (combined transport)     - Objectives: To shift the balance between modes of transport by means of a pro-active policy to promote intermodality and transport by rail, sea and inland waterway. In this connection, one of the major initiatives is the "       Marco Polo      " Community support programme to replace the current       PACT      (Pilot Action for Combined Transport) programme.     - Figures: The PACT programme launched 167 projects between 1992 and 2000. The new "Marco Polo" intermodality programme has an annual budget of 115 million euros for the period between 2003-2007.     -Problems: The balance between modes of transport must cope with the fact that there is no close connection between sea, inland waterways and rail.     - Measures proposed: The "Marco Polo" intermodality programme is open to all appropriate proposals to shift freight from road to other more environmentally friendly modes. The aim is to turn intermodality into a competitive, economically viable reality, particularly by promoting motorways of the sea.     Bottlenecks and trans-European networks     - Objectives: To construct the major infrastructure proposed in the trans-European networks (       TENs      ) programme, identified by the 1996 guidelines, as well as the     priority projects selected at the 1994 Essen European Council .     - Figures: Of the 14 projects selected in Essen, three have now been completed and six others, which are in the construction phase, were expected to be finished by 2005, states the Communication.     - Problems: The delays in completing the trans-European networks are due to inadequate funding. In the case of the Alpine routes which require the construction of very long tunnels, it is proving difficult to raise the capital to complete them. The Commission has proposed, in particular, completion of the high-speed railway network for passengers, including links to airports, and a high-capacity rail crossing in the Pyrenees.     - Measures proposed: The Commission has proposed two-stage revision of the trans-European network guidelines. The first stage, in 2001, was to revise the TEN guidelines adopted in Essen to eliminate bottlenecks on the main routes. The second stage in 2004 will focus on motorways of the sea, airport capacity and pan-European corridors on the territory of candidate countries. The Commission is looking at the idea of introducing the concept of declaration of European interest where specific infrastructure is regarded as being of strategic importance to the smooth functioning of the internal market.     The priority projects are:      completing the Alpine routes on grounds of safety and capacity;       making it easier to cross the Pyrenees, in particular, by completing the Barcelona-Perpignan rail link;       launching new priority projects, such as the Stuttgart-Munich-Salzburg/Linz-Vienna TGV/combined transport link, the Fehmarn Belt linking Denmark and Germany, improving navigability on the Danube between Straubing and Vilshofen, the Galileo radionavigation project, the Iberian high-speed train network and addition of the Verona-Naples and Bologna-Milan rail links plus extension of the southern European TGV network to N�mes in France;       improving tunnel safety by having specific safety standards for both railway and road tunnels.      On infrastructure funding and technical regulations, the Commission has proposed:      changes to the rules for funding the trans-European network to raise the maximum Community contribution to 20%. This would apply to cross-border rail projects crossing natural barriers, such as mountain ranges or stretches of water, as well as to projects in border areas of the candidate countries;       establishment of a Community framework to channel revenue from charges on competing routes (for example, from heavy goods vehicles) towards rail projects in particular;       a directive designed to guarantee the interoperability of toll systems on the trans-European road network.      Users     - Objectives: To place users at the heart of transport policy, i.e. to reduce the number of accidents, harmonise penalties and develop safer, cleaner technologies.     - Figures: In 2000 road accidents killed over 40 000 people in the European Union. One person in three will be injured in an accident at some point in their lives. The total annual cost of these accidents is equivalent to 2% of the EU's GNP.     - Problems: Road safety is of prime concern for transport users. However, spending fails to reflect the severity of the situation. Users have the right to know what they are paying and why. Ideally, the charge for use of infrastructure should be calculated by adding together maintenance and operating costs plus external costs stemming from, for example, accidents, pollution, noise and congestion. Finally, non-harmonisation of fuel taxes is another obstacle to smooth operation of the internal market.     - Measures proposed:     On road safety, the Commission has proposed:      a new road safety         action programme        covering the period 2002-2010 to halve the number of deaths on the roads;       harmonisation of penalties, road signs and blood-alcohol levels;       development of new technologies such as electronic driving licences, speed limits for cars and intelligent transport systems as part of the e-Europe programme. In this connection, progress is being made on protection of vehicle occupants, on making life safer for pedestrians and cyclists and on improving vehicle-speed management.      On charging for use of infrastructure, the Commission has proposed:      a framework directive to establish the principles of infrastructure charging and a pricing structure, including a common methodology to incorporate internal and external costs and aiming to create the conditions for fair competition between modes.(a) In the case of road transport, charges will vary according to the vehicle's environmental performance (exhaust gas emissions and noise), the type of infrastructure (motorways, trunk and urban roads), distance covered, axle weight and degree of congestion.(b) In the case of rail transport, charges will be graduated according to scarcity of infrastructure capacity and adverse environmental effects.(c) In the case of maritime transport, the measures proposed will be linked to maritime safety;       a directive on the interoperability of toll systems to be put in place on the trans-European road network.      On fuel tax, the Commission has proposed:      separating fuel taxes for private and commercial uses,       establishing harmonised taxation of fuel used for commercial purposes.      Other measures have been proposed to improve intermodality for multimodal journeys, in particular for those using rail and air successively, including integrated ticketing and improvements in baggage handling.

act   Regulation (EU) No  1293/2013  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 on the establishment of a programme for the environment and climate action (LIFE) and repealing Regulation (EC) No 614/2007.   summary   The  programme for the environment and climate action (LIFE)  for 2014 to 2020 aims to contribute to sustainable development and to the achievement of the objectives and targets of the  Europe 2020 strategy  , the seventh EU environment action programme and other relevant EU environment and climate change initiatives.  The programme has two subprogrammes (environment and climate action). It also introduces  integrated projects  , which operate on a large scale, starting at regional or multi-city level. These aim to implement environmental and climate change policy by applying plans and strategies based on EU legislation and integrating these policies further into other policy areas. The intention is to mobilise complementary funds, especially EU funds, to do so.  Other new features are two innovative financial instruments for funding projects through  loans and equity  : the PF4EE (Private for Financing for Energy Efficiency) and the NCFF (Natural Capital Financing Facility), which is co-funded by the Commission and the European Investment Bank (EIB) on a pilot scale.  Overall, at least 81 % of LIFE resources is to be spent on projects.  LIFE’s main objectives include:   use as a  catalyst  for changes in policymaking on environment and climate action;   promoting  implementation and integration  of environment and climate objectives in other policies and EU countries’ practice;    better governance  ;   specific  link to EU priorities  : resource efficiency, biodiversity loss and climate adaptation and mitigation.   The  environment subprogramme  (75 % of the budget) has three priority areas:   environment and resource efficiency;   nature and biodiversity (55 % of the budget for action grants under the environment subprogramme);   environmental governance and information.   These priorities cover seven  thematic priorities  : nature and biodiversity; water, including the marine environment; waste; resource efficiency, including  soil and forests  and  green and circular economy  ; environment and health, including  chemicals and noise  ; air quality and emissions, including the urban environment; and information and governance.  The  climate action subprogramme  (25 % of the budget) has three priority areas:   mitigation (contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions);   adaptation (supports efforts to increase the resilience to climate change);   LIFE climate governance and information (e.g. raising awareness of climate matters).    National allocations   During the first multiannual work programme (2014-17), national allocations apply only to ‘traditional’ (i.e. best practice, demonstration, pilot or information, awareness and dissemination) projects and the NCFF under the environment subprogramme. As of 2018, the selection of these projects will be exclusively based on merit.   Territorial scope   Non-EU countries may participate in LIFE, based on a specific agreement with the Commission. Programme activities outside the EU are possible under certain circumstances, as is cooperation with international bodies.  The LIFE programme 2014-20 has a total budget of almost €3,456.7 million.

summary of   Directive (EU) 2016/680 — protecting individuals with regard to the processing of their personal data by police and criminal justice authorities, and on the free movement of such data   what is the aim of the directive   It aims to better protect individuals’ personal data when their data is being processed by police and criminal justice authorities.   It also aims to improve cooperation in the fight against terrorism and cross-border crime in the EU by enabling police and criminal justice authorities in EU countries to exchange information necessary for investigations more efficiently and effectively.   The Data Protection Directive for Police and Criminal Justice Authorities is part of the EU data protection reform package along with the  General Data Protection Regulation  (Regulation (EU) 2016/679).   key points   The directive requires that the data collected by law enforcement authorities are:   processed  lawfully and fairly  ;   collected for  specified, explicit and legitimate purposes  and processed only in line with these purposes;    adequate, relevant and not excessive  in relation to the purpose in which they are processed;    accurate and updated  where necessary;   kept in a form which allows identification of the individual for no longer than is necessary for the purpose of the processing;    appropriately secured  , including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing.    Time limits   EU countries must establish time limits for erasing the personal data or for a regular  review  of the need to store such data.   Individuals concerned (‘data subjects’)   The directive requires that the law enforcement authorities make a clear distinction between the data of different categories of persons including:   those for whom there are  serious grounds  to believe they have committed or are about to commit a criminal offence;   those who have been  convicted of a criminal offence  ;    victims of criminal offences  or persons whom it is reasonably believed could be victims of criminal offences;   those who are  parties to a criminal offence  , including potential witnesses.    Information available or provided to data subject   Individuals have the right to have certain information made available to them by the  law enforcement (i.e. data protection) authorities  including:   the  name and contact details of the competent authority  which decides the purpose and means of the data processing;   why their data is being processed;   the right to  launch a complaint  with a supervisory authority and the contact details of the authority;   the existence of the right to request  access to and correction or deletion of their personal data  as well as the right to restrict  processing of their personal data  .    Security   National authorities must take  technical and organisational measures  to ensure a level of security for personal data that is  appropriate to the risk  . Where data processing is automated, a number of measures must be put in place, including:   denying unauthorised persons  access to equipment  used for processing;   preventing the unauthorised reading, copying, changing or removal of  data media  ;   preventing the  unauthorised input of personal data  and the unauthorised viewing, changing or deleting of  stored personal data  .    Repeal   The directive replaces  Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA  on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters with effect from 6 May 2018.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 5 May 2016. EU countries have to incorporate it into their national law by 6 May 2018.   background    European Commission  press release  ;    ‘Protection of personal data’  on the European Commission's website.
summary of   Directive 2008/9/EC — rules for the refund of value added tax to taxable persons not established in the EU country of refund but established in another EU country   what is the aim of the directive  It lays down the detailed rules for the refund of  value added tax (VAT)  , provided for in Directive 2006/112/EC,  the EU’s common system of value added tax (VAT)  , to taxable persons not established in the   EU  country of refund   *  but established in another EU country.   key points   The directive applies to any taxable person not established in the EU country of refund (but established in another EU country) who, during the refund period:   did not have in that EU country, the seat of his economic activity, a fixed establishment from which business transactions were carried out or, in the absence of such a seat or fixed establishment, his home or normal place of residence;   did not supply any goods or services in that EU country, except for certain exempt transport services and the supply of goods and services to a person who is liable to pay VAT.   EU countries must refund to any taxable person not established in their country (but established in another EU country) any VAT charged for goods or services supplied to him or her by other taxable persons in that EU country or for goods imported into that country, when used for the purposes of the transactions listed in Directive 2006/112/EC.  To be  eligible for a refund  in the EU country of refund, a taxable person not established in that country must carry out transactions giving rise to a right of deduction in their own EU country. When a taxable person not established in the EU country of refund carries out in his or her own EU country both transactions producing a right of deduction and transactions not producing a right of deduction in that country, the EU country of the refund will only pay the proportion of refundable VAT.   Refund application   This directive introduces a fully  electronic procedure  . The taxable person not established in the EU country of refund (but established in another EU country) sends an electronic refund application to the EU country of refund via the electronic portal of his or her own EU country. The refund application relates to the VAT on the purchase of goods or services which was invoiced during the refund period, and the goods imported during the refund period.  The refund application must be submitted to the EU country of establishment before 30 September of the calendar year following the refund period. The amount of VAT refund applied for must in principle not be less than €400 (or €50 where certain conditions are met). If the country is late in making the refund payment, the applicant will be entitled to  interest  on the amount of the refund. The EU country of establishment must send the applicant an  electronic confirmation of receipt without delay  .   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 20 February 2008 and had to become law in the EU countries by 1 January 2010. It repeals Directive  79/1072/EEC  .   background   For more information, see:    VAT refunds  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    EU country of refund:  the country in which the VAT was charged to the taxable person for goods or services supplied by other taxable persons in that EU country or for the import of goods into that EU country.
summary of   Directive 2009/33/EC on promoting clean and energy-efficient road transport vehicles   what is the aim of the directive  It aims at promoting and stimulating the development of a market for clean and energy-efficient vehicles.  It requires public authorities and certain other public transport operators to take into account the impact of these vehicles during their operational lifetime in terms of:    energy  consumption;   CO  2  emissions; and   other pollutant emissions.   key points    Scope   The directive applies to contracts for the purchase of road transport vehicles entered into by:   contracting authorities and contracting entities;   operators of public service obligations under a public service contract.    Purchase of clean and energy-efficient road transport vehicles   EU countries must ensure that contracting authorities, contracting entities and operators under a public service contract take into account the operational lifetime energy and environmental impacts when purchasing road transport vehicles.  Energy and environmental impacts include:   energy consumption;   emissions of CO  2  ;   emissions of NOx, non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) and particulate matter.   To meet the requirement to take into account the environmental impact of vehicles, contracting authorities, contracting entities and public transport operators can choose:   to set technical specifications for energy and environmental performance in the documentation they draw up when the vehicle is purchased; or   to include energy and environmental impacts in the purchasing decision.    Methodology for the calculation of operational lifetime costs   The directive prescribes a  methodology  to calculate the cost of energy consumption, CO  2  emissions and pollutant emissions during a vehicle’s operational lifetime where the contracting authority, contracting entity or the operator under a public service contract has chosen to include the energy and environmental impacts in the purchasing decision.  The  operational lifetime cost of the energy consumption  of a vehicle is calculated using the following method:   fuel consumption per kilometre is calculated in units of energy consumption per kilometre;   the calculation uses a single monetary value per unit of energy;   the operational lifetime cost of the energy consumption of a vehicle is calculated by multiplying the mileage already performed by energy consumption, and then by the cost per unit of energy.   The  cost of CO  2  emissions  is calculated by multiplying the mileage already performed by CO  2  emissions in kilograms per kilometre, and then by the cost per kilogram.  The  cost of pollutant emissions  is obtained by adding the costs related to emissions of NOx, NMHC and particulate matter.   Sharing best practice   The  European Commission  encourages the sharing of knowledge and best practice between EU countries with a view to promoting the purchase of clean and energy-efficient road transport vehicles.  Several initiatives are under way that ensure the directive is implemented. These include:   guidelines on  green public procurement  and a  technical background report  ;   the  European Green Vehicle Initiative  which seeks to support the development of green vehicles and sustainable mobility solutions;   the  European Clean Bus deployment initiative  ; and    various studies  .   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 4 June 2009 and had to become law in the EU countries from 4 December 2010.   background   The EU’s climate and energy package includes targets for 2020 for  energy efficiency  , a target minimum share for  renewable energy  and targets for  reducing greenhouse gas emissions  . The transport sector can make a significant contribution to meeting these targets.  For more information, see:    Clean vehicles directive  (  European Commission  ).   related document   Report from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the application of Directive 2009/33/EC on the promotion of clean and energy efficient road transport vehicles (  COM (2013) 214 final  , 18.4.2013)
summary of   Directive 2013/34/EU on the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of businesses   what is the aim of the directive  It aims to:   ensure the clarity and comparability of financial statements, other than international financial reporting standards (  IFRS  );   limit administrative burdens and provide for simple and robust accounting rules, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);   increase transparency of the payments made by the mining and logging industries to governments.   key points    The legislation applies to limited liability types of companies in the European Union (EU).   The legislation defines and differentiates between micro-, small, medium and large companies, on the basis of their:   balance sheet;   net turnover; and   average number of employees during a financial year.     For each category, it sets 3 limits, 2 of which must not be exceeded:    micro-undertakings  : balance sheet (€350,000), net turnover (€700,000), employees (10);    small undertakings:  balance sheet (€4 million), net turnover (€8 million), employees (50);    medium-sized undertakings:  balance sheet (€20 million), net turnover (€40 million), employees (250);    large undertakings:  balance sheet (€20 million), net turnover (€40 million), employees (250).      Annual financial statements  must:   contain, as a minimum, the  balance sheet  , the  profit and loss account  and the  notes to the financial statements   *  ;   give a true and fair view of the company’s assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss;   be published by each company in the relevant national business register.     The directive sets out  general financial reporting principles  , such as consistent application of accounting policies and measurement bases from one year to the next.   Detailed rules cover the  presentation  of the balance sheets, profit and loss accounts and the notes to the financial statements, as well as management reports, non-financial information, corporate governance and consolidated statements.   The  obligations  may vary depending on a company’s size and the directive allows for  exemptions or simplifications  in many areas for micro-undertakings and SMEs. It is up to each EU country to decide on the extent of these exemptions and simplifications.   The financial statements of public-interest entities, medium-sized and large undertakings must be audited by one or more  statutory auditors  .   Large companies involved in mining minerals, oil, natural gas or other materials or involved in logging in primary forests  *  must publish details of payments over €100,000 in total that they make to governments in any financial year.   The legislation repeals earlier accounting directives (78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC) and amends Directive 2006/43/EC.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 19 July 2013. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 20 July 2015.   background    The directive is part of the European Commission’s  better regulation programme  . This emphasises the importance of quality legislation that ensures administrative burdens are proportionate to the benefits they bring.   For more information, see:    ‘Company Reporting’  on the European Commission's website.     * key terms     Notes to the financial statements:  additional information to that contained in a company’s financial statements. This information is provided in the interests of clarity and may include, for example, accounting methodologies used for recording and reporting transactions and pension plan details.

   Developing the agenda for the Community's external aviation policy     Developing the agenda for the Community's external aviation policy     Following the "open skies" judgments, Member States cannot act in isolation when negotiating international air service agreements. These services must now be treated as a subject of Community interest. By developing an external aviation policy, the European Union (EU) can take steps towards reforming civil aviation and opening up markets to fair competition.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 11 March 2005 - Developing the agenda for the Community’s external aviation policy [       COM(2005) 79      – not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The so-called "open skies" judgments of 5 November 2002 of the Court of Justice of the European Communities marked the start of a Community external aviation policy which this communication is seeking to develop in terms of the economic issues at stake for European industry.     This case law testifies to the Community's powers in the field of international air services, whereas traditionally these services had always been governed by bilateral agreements between States.     The "open skies" judgments identify three areas coming under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Community: computerised reservation systems, intra-Community tariffs and time slots, each of which is governed entirely by Community legislation.     Bilateral negotiation by a Member State, as covered by       Regulation (EC) No 847/2004      , means that existing agreements can be brought into line in the context of the regular ongoing contacts between Member States and their partners. Bilateral negotiation at Community level in the framework of the so-called "horizontal mandate" which, on the basis of an agreement negotiated by the Commission, permits the insertion of the necessary standard clauses in the whole range of agreements concluded between the Member States and a given third country. By virtue of requiring just one single round of negotiations, an agreement of this kind has the advantage of enabling a third country to cut down on a series of individual negotiations with the Member States with which it is linked.     The roadmap for implementing the Community’s external aviation policy incorporates two complementary objectives:      creating a Common Aviation Area by 2010 which will comprise the European Community and all its partners located along its southern and eastern borders, with a view to achieving a high degree of economic and regulatory integration of aviation markets in this area. The various parties would share the same market operation rules, not only from an economic point of view but also with regard to air traffic, security and air safety.       launching, in the short term, targeted negotiations on global agreements in the major regions of the world, with the aim of strengthening the prospects for promoting European industry and ensuring fair competition in the most dynamic world markets, while at the same time helping to reform international civil aviation.      A first group would include the countries engaged in pan-European cooperation with a view to accession. While negotiations to this end have already resumed with Romania, Bulgaria and the Western Balkans, steps should be taken to ensure that Turkey is also included.     A second group is made up of the countries bordering the Mediterranean whose key objectives are to open up markets, create fair operating conditions but also to boost security, safety and environmentally-friendly behaviour.     Russia is a priority, on both an economic and political level. Given the extent of its traffic to the outside (75% of which is directed towards the Community in the case of passenger traffic), it should be offered a wide-ranging agreement encompassing several specific strands and seeking to promote both economic openness and cooperation as a means of bringing markets together and developing industrial potential.     China and India are target countries for Community policy due to their huge populations and rapidly growing economies. Similarly, Japan and South Korea, both with prosperous markets, should also be considered as desirable partners.     Lastly, aviation negotiations with other third countries, such the United States, Canada, Chile and Mexico could create economic as well as political advantages.     RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission of 1 October 2008 called “Common aviation area with the Neighbouring Countries by 2010: progress report”       [         COM(2008) 596 Final        – Not published in the Official Journal].      The creation of a planned common aviation area (CAA) with the EU’s eastern and southern neighbours should lead to the creation of new market opportunities and the introduction of a harmonised regulatory environment. This initiative complements the objectives of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and the Union for the Mediterranean.     The approach adopted takes into account the situation of each country and its capacity to integrate progressively into the CAA. The Commission supports this integration and in particular:     The development of the CAA and the harmonised implementation of the existing aviation       acquis      should help to ensure:     The Commission proposes to accelerate the negotiation process and the ratification of bilateral agreements. However, it is unlikely that the objective of an enlarged CAA will be achieved before 2010. In 2007, more than 120 million passengers travelled between the EU and its neighbouring countries.

   Protection of video game users     Protection of video game users     Strong growth in the European video game market and the development of new media has increased the risk that consumers will be exposed to illegal or harmful content. The video game industry has introduced a self-regulatory video game rating system aimed particularly at the protection of minors.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the protection of consumers, in particular minors, in respect of the use of video games – 22 April 2008 [       COM(2008) 207 final      – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This Communication examines the methods used to assess the content, classification and labelling of video and computer games in Member States. It follows the Council Resolution of 1 March 2002 on the protection of consumers through the labelling of certain video games and computer games [OJ C65, 14.3.2002].      Video game rating systems      The Pan-European Game Information age rating system (PEGI) is a voluntary, self-regulatory system. It was introduced following consultations with the industry and civil society in order to replace national age rating systems with a single European system.     Most European Union (EU) Member States use PEGI, and some also have specific legislation. However, in 2008, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Romania and Slovenia had no age or content rating systems in place.      Access to video games      Half of the Member States have specific legal provisions, in both civil and criminal law, concerning the sale of video games with content that may be harmful to minors in retail shops. In 2008, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Denmark, Hungary, Luxembourg, Poland, the Czech Republic and Romania had no specific legislation governing these matters.     A Code of Conduct for video game retailers could improve the protection of minors in Europe. Complementary measures such as       media literacy campaigns      and parental awareness-raising activities may also be necessary.     Some States have officially banned the distribution of certain video games due to their illegal or dangerous nature. The Commission considers that these bans should be limited to cases where there are serious breaches of human dignity.      Access to computer games      In the majority of Member States, online games are subject to general national legislation. Alternatively, the legislation concerning offline video games may be applied by analogy. Some States use the PEGI Online system, which was designed to better protect young people against unsuitable gaming content and to help parents understand the dangers of the Internet.     Because online games are readily accessible on the Internet, certain Member States have taken additional protection measures. This is notably the case in Germany, which has created a Common Agency for Youth Protection on the Internet, in Ireland, where consumers can call a special hotline, and in Latvia, where the distribution of video games is subject to strict conditions.     The Commission is proposing a pan-European dialogue to reinforce the monitoring of this category of video game. In addition, it points out that the fight against       cybercrime      could be enhanced through public-private cooperation.      Harmonisation of policies      Offline and online video games are subject to different regulations and rating systems. Cross-platform pan-European ratings would promote system transparency and the free movement of products within the European market.     The Commission calls on Member States and stakeholders to:      protect minors while ensuring high standards of freedom of expression;       integrate the information and classification system put in place for the purposes of the PEGI and PEGI Online initiatives into their national systems;       raise awareness of the PEGI and PEGI Online systems, and improve media literacy;       develop new age and content verification systems;       better assess the positive and negative effects of video games;       adopt a Pan-European Code of Conduct on the sale of video games to minors.       Context      In view of the significant growth of the video game market and the increased access to media, in particular the Internet, the European Union is seeking to provide a high level of       protection for minors and human dignity      . The       Insafe network      managed by the European Commission aims to inform the general public about the use of new media by children.

act   Regulation (EC) No  1221/2009  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS), repealing Regulation (EC) No 761/2001 and Commission Decisions 2001/681/EC and 2006/193/EC.   summary    what does the regulation do  It establishes the voluntary EMAS. This is the premium environmental management tool for users to evaluate, report and improve their environmental performance.   key points   To receive EMAS registration, an organisation must:   conduct a review of all the environmental aspects of its activities, products and services;   adopt an environmental policy containing a commitment to comply with all the relevant legislation and to achieve continuous improvements;   develop a programme with information on specific environmental objectives and targets;   establish an effective management system to achieve its environmental policy and ensure continuous improvement;   carry out an environmental audit assessing the management system in place and overall conformity with its policy and programme;   provide an environmental statement of its performance, set against its objectives, and the future steps to be taken.   The environmental review, management system, audit procedure and statement must be approved by an accredited environmental verifier.  The validated statement is registered and made publicly available.  An organisation successfully completing all these stages may use the EMAS logo on its letterheads, products, activities and services to demonstrate its commitment to improving its environmental performance.   background   EMAS helps give registered organisations enhanced performance, cost savings and a positive public image. By mid 2015, over 4,000 organisations and approximately 7,500 sites were EMAS registered worldwide. They included multinationals, smaller companies and public authorities.  The European Commission employs EMAS to reduce the environmental impact of its own activities, particularly by using natural resources more efficiently, reducing CO  2  emissions, preventing, recycling and reusing waste, applying green public procurement and promoting sustainable mobility.

   Inland waterways: access to the occupation of carrier of goods by waterway and mutual recognition of diplomas     Inland waterways: access to the occupation of carrier of goods by waterway and mutual recognition of diplomas     This Directive is intended to facilitate the implementation of the common transport policy by achieving better organisation of the market. To this end, it improves the coordination of the conditions for access to the occupation of carrier, encouraging achievement of the free provision of services and the effective exercise of the right of establishment.     ACT     Council Directive       87/540/EEC      of 9 November 1987 on access to the occupation of carrier of goods by waterway in national and international transport and on the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications for this occupation [Official Journal L 322 of 12 November 1987].     SUMMARY     Organisation of the transport market is necessary for the implementation of a common transport policy. Therefore, the measures intended to coordinate the conditions for access to the occupation of carrier are directed towards market integration, in the interest of users, carriers and the economy as a whole. This Directive is also likely to encourage the achievement of the free provision of services and the effective exercise of the right of establishment.     At the same time, the Directive allows for a degree of flexibility by allowing Member States to maintain or lay down rules governing the good repute and financial standing of the carrier. Carriers operating exclusively on navigable waterways on their territory not linked to the waterway network of another Member State may also be exempted from the Directive.     The Directive is based on the principle of mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications.      Scope      Access to the occupation of carrier of goods by waterway is governed by the Member States within the framework of the common rules as laid down in this Directive. The Directive does not apply to natural persons or undertakings pursuing the occupation of carrier of goods by waterway using vessels with a deadweight capacity at maximum draft not exceeding 200 tonnes. However, Member States may lower this limit for all or some transport operations or certain categories of transport.      Access to the occupation      Natural persons and undertakings must meet the condition of professional competence, which means possessing the competences recognised by the authority or body appointed to this end by each Member State in the areas listed in the annex. The authority will issue a certificate once it has verified possession of these competences (on the basis of a diploma, attendance at a course or sufficient practical experience). If the carrier no longer meets the conditions, the certificate may be withdrawn.       Key terms used in the act         Occupation of carrier of goods by waterway vessel: the activities engaged in by any natural person or any undertaking carrying goods by inland waterway for hire or reward, even if this occupation is not exercised on a regular basis,         Undertaking: companies or firms within the meaning of Article 58 of the Treaty and groups or cooperatives of operators whose purpose is to obtain business from shipping agents for distribution among their members, irrespective of whether such groups or cooperatives possess legal personality.

summary of   Decision 2008/202/EC — conclusion of the EU-Japan agreement on cooperation and mutual administrative assistance in customs matters    EU-Japan agreement on cooperation and mutual administrative assistance in customs matters   what is the aim of the decision and of the agreement   Due to their extensive trade relations, this cooperation agreement between EU and Japanese  customs authorities   *  is essential to facilitate trade between the parties. It also seeks to safeguard the security of the supply chain and the effectiveness of the fight against fraud, including cooperation on the protection of intellectual property rights.   The decision concludes the agreement on behalf of the EU.   key points    Customs cooperation    The agreement introduces cooperation encompassing all fields of customs legislation.   This cooperation is achieved by establishing channels of communication and by introducing coordination between customs authorities.   The parties undertake to facilitate commercial transactions while increasing their level of security. The agreement aims in particular at improving customs techniques and procedures. The objective is to strengthen cooperation at bilateral level and within international organisations.    Mutual administrative assistance   There are 2 types of assistance between authorities in the event of customs operations that are in breach of legislation:    assistance on request  , concerning the lawfulness of and customs procedure for imports and exports of goods, suspects, places of storage and the transport of goods;    spontaneous assistance  , concerning in particular the potential risks to the economy, public safety and public health. In the interests of the other party, the  requested authority   *  provides all information relating to activities, resources and methods, goods, persons and means of transport.    Formal aspects and exceptions to assistance    Requests must be made in writing in a language understood by both authorities. In urgent cases, an oral request may precede the written request.   To facilitate the processing of the request, the  applicant authority   *  must provide sufficient information on the measure requested, the object of and the reason for the request. It also provides information on the suspects, the legislation involved, the relevant facts and investigations carried out.   To comply with a request for assistance, the requested authority communicates all information already available to it or undertakes any necessary investigation. The measures taken must be coordinated with the applicant authority.   If it is not possible to comply with a request, a reasoned communication is sent to the applicant authority without delay.   A request may be refused or postponed. It may also be made subject to conditions in the event of prejudice to the sovereignty, security, public policy or interests of a country, especially where the protection of the information transmitted cannot be guaranteed.   The data transmitted is confidential; it is protected under the laws and regulations applicable in the country of the applicant authority. However, this information may be used as evidence in the context of a preparatory inquiry.   A  Joint Customs Cooperation Committee  is responsible for the proper functioning of this agreement.   date of entry into force   The agreement entered into force on 1 February 2008.   background   For more information, see:    Taxation and Customs Union — Japan  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Customs authority:  in Japan, the Ministry of Finance, and, in the EU, the competent services of the European Commission and the customs authorities of the EU countries.

   Next Generation Access Networks (NGA)     Next Generation Access Networks (NGA)     The       Digital Agenda      launched by the European Commission in May 2010 should allow every European to access fast broadband by 2013 and very fast broadband by 2020. The regulation of access to Next Generation Access Networks (NGA) constitutes a crucial step towards achieving this goal. This Recommendation therefore defines a common regulatory approach as regards access to the new very fast broadband networks using optical fibre, to offer a balance between encouraging investment and maintaining competition.     ACT     Commission Recommendation       2010/572/EU      of 20 September 2010 on regulated access to Next Generation Access Networks (NGA) Text with EEA relevance.     SUMMARY     This Recommendation aims at promoting the transition to Next Generation Access Networks (NGA)       *      . It involves establishing a common approach for the regulation of access to NGA on the basis of a prior market analysis procedure pursuant to Directives       2002/19/EC      and       2002/21/EC      on electronic communication networks. The Recommendation forms part of the package of measures presented by the European Commission in September 2010 which also includes a       Communication on broadband      and a Proposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a       European radio spectrum policy programme      .      Consistent approach      During the transition towards Next Generation Access Networks, National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) must ensure that operators designated with Significant Market Power (SMP) provide all information necessary for designing regulatory remedies. In this context, NRAs may use the powers laid down in Article 5 of       Directive 2002/21/EC      .     Where NRAs carry out market analysis, they must define and apply their regulatory approach taking into account the Commission’s Recommendation as far as possible.      Geographical variation      There may be divergence in conditions of competition according to geographic areas. Where divergences in the conditions of competition are stable and substantial, NRAs may therefore define sub-national geographic markets in accordance with Recommendation       2007/879/EC      . Where divergences in conditions of competition cannot be identified adequately, NRAs should carry out monitoring to determine whether deployment of NGA networks might nevertheless justify the implementation of differentiated remedies.      Access to wholesale physical network infrastructure (Market 4)      Where the market includes operators in a dominant position (SMP), NRAs should put in place remedies which must take into account:       access to civil engineering infrastructure of the SMP operator        which should be mandated at cost-oriented prices;        access to the terminating segment in the case of FTTH (Fibre to the Home)         *         deployment        which must include access to the wiring inside buildings and, if applicable, horizontal wiring up to the first distribution point;        unbundled access to the local fibre loop in the case of FTTH deployment        which should be accompanied by appropriate measures for co-location and backhaul. In addition, this access should take place at the most appropriate point in the network, which is normally the Metropolitan Point of Presence (MPoP)         *        ;        obligatory unbundled access to the copper sub-loop in the case of FTTN (Fibre to the Neighbourhood) deployment        which should be supplemented by backhaul measures and ancillary remedies.       Wholesale broadband access (Market 5)      Where SMP is found on Market 5, wholesale broadband access remedies should be maintained or amended for existing services and their chain substitutes.     On this market, NRAs are encouraged to mandate the provision of different wholesale products that reflect the technical capabilities inherent in the NGA infrastructure in order to foster competition between operators.      Migration      The obligations concerning SMP should be maintained, except where migration agreements are concluded between the SMP operator and the operators enjoying access to the SMP operator’s network. If agreement is not reached, the SMP operator must warn the other operators at least five years before any de-commissioning of points of interconnection takes place.     Concerning the migration from copper to fibre-based networks, NRAs must put in place a transparent framework. They must ensure that undertakings enjoying access to the SMP operator’s network receive all necessary information in order to adjust their networks and network plans.       Key terms of the Act         Next Generation Access Networks: wired access networks which consist wholly or in part of optical elements and which are capable of delivering broadband access services with enhanced characteristics (such as higher throughput) as compared to those provided over already existing copper networks.         Fibre-to-the-home or FTTH: an access network consisting of optical fibre lines in both the feeder and the drop segments of the access network, i.e. connecting a customer’s premises (the home or in multi-dwelling units the apartment) to the MPoP by means of optical fibre.         Metropolitan Point of Presence (MPoP): the point of inter-connection between the access and core networks of an NGA operator.       Last updated: 20.10.2010  
   EU action for the European Capitals of Culture 2020 to 2033     EU action for the European Capitals of Culture 2020 to 2033     SUMMARY OF:      Decision No 445/2014/EU — EU action for the European Capitals of Culture for the years 2020 to 2033      WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DECISION?      Decision No 445/2014/EU      :      renews and updates the European Capitals of Culture (ECoC) scheme for the period 2020-2033;       sets out the rules, the procedures and the calendar for the designation of ECoCs during this period.      KEY POINTS     The ECoC initiative celebrates the rich diversity of cultures in Europe and the common features they share by designating two cities each year to carry this title.      Eligibility      Each year, two       European Union      (EU) countries are listed in the calendar set out in the decision, and one city is awarded the title from each country. Every three years a third city from an       European Free Trade Association      (EFTA) /       European Economic Area      (EEA) country, a       candidate country      or a potential candidate country may also be designated.      Selection criteria        Contribution to the long-term strategy        : the long-term cultural, social and economic impact of the ECoC year as well as its sustainability after the year ends.        European dimension        : how dialogue and greater mutual understanding between European citizens, both artists and the wider public, is promoted, highlighting common aspects of culture, heritage and history, as well as cultural diversity.        Cultural and artistic content        :          artistic vision and strategy;           involvement of local artists and organisations in the programme;           combining new and innovative experimental expression with the local and traditional.          Capacity to deliver        : broad political support and commitment to a viable and sustainable infrastructure.        Outreach        :          involvement of local people in the events, in particular minorities and disadvantaged people;           links with education;           audience development strategy.          Management        : feasibility of fundraising and budgets, overall governance and adequacy of the delivery structure, contingency planning, marketing and communication.       Selection process      The       competition      for the title is launched 6 years in advance and the ECoCs are designated 4 years before the event.     The       two-stage selection process      is carried out by a panel of independent experts, in the countries concerned:      a         preselection process        after which a shortlist is prepared, with recommendations from the panel to the shortlisted cities;       a         final selection process        takes place 9 months later, with the panel recommending one city for the title.      On the basis of the panel’s recommendation, the EU country concerned designates one city to hold the title and the       European Commission      then has 2 months to publish the list of the cities designated as ECoCs. A similar process is used to designate cities from candidate or potential candidate countries, but in this case the Commission is responsible for the designation.     Once the cities are designated, the panel provides guidance and support while the cities prepare their programmes. During this period, the cities submit regular progress reports and representatives attend regular monitoring meetings.      COVID-19 pandemic impact      In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, amending Decision (EU)       2020/2229      recognises that, for the ECoCs designated for 2020, the action’s objectives, which presuppose mobility, tourism, organisation of events and public participation, were difficult if not impossible to attain. It thus amends the calendar annexed to Decision No 445/2014/EU to:      grant Rijeka and Galway the possibility to extend their ECoC 2020 year until 30 April 2021, without changing the year of designation;       postpone from 2021 to 2023 the year in which Timisoara and Elefsina are entitled to host the ECoC event;       postpone from 2021 to 2022 the year in which a candidate or potential candidate country may apply to host the ECoC event.       Designated ECoCs from 2022 to 2025      The following cities have been designated EcoCs from 2022 to 2025.      2022: Kaunas (Lithuania), Esch (Luxembourg) and Novi Sad (Serbia, candidate country).       2023: Veszprém (Hungary), Timișoara (Romania) and Elefsina (Greece).       2024: Tartu (Estonia), Bodø (Norway, EFTA/EEA country) and Bad Ischl (Austria).       2025: Chemnitz (Germany) and Nova Gorica (Slovenia, recommended).       Repeal      Decision No 445/2014/EU repeals Decision No       1622/2006/EC      .     FROM WHEN DO THE DECISIONS APPLY?      Decision No 445/2014/EU has applied since 4 May 2014.       Amending Decision (EU) 2020/2229 has applied since 1 January 2021.      BACKGROUND     Since the mid 1980s, when the ECoC initiative was first launched, there has been increased recognition of the role of culture in cities as a catalyst for creativity, social and territorial cohesion, employment and growth.

   MEDA programme     MEDA programme     To implement the cooperation measures designed to help Mediterranean non-member countries reform their economic and social structures and mitigate the social and environmental consequences of economic development.     ACT     Council Regulation (EC) No       1488/96      of 23 July 1996 on financial and technical measures to accompany (MEDA) the reform of economic and social structures in the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership [Official Journal L 189 of 30.07.1996].     SUMMARY     1. The MEDA Regulation is the principal instrument of economic and financial cooperation under the Euro-Mediterranean partnership. It was launched in 1996 (MEDA I) and amended in 2000 (MEDA II). It enables the European Union (EU) to provide financial and technical assistance to the countries in the southern Mediterranean: Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, the Palestinian Territory, Syria, Tunisia and Turkey. The MEDA programme takes the place of the various bilateral financial protocols that exist with the countries in the Mediterranean basin. It is inspired by the Phare and TACIS programmes, especially as regards transparency and information. A budget heading is established for financing the programme.     2. Actions under the MEDA programme aim to fulfil the objectives of the three sectors of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership:      reinforcing political stability and democracy;       creating a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area and the development of economic and social cooperation;       taking due account of the human and cultural dimension.       Measures supported      3. The MEDA programme supports the       economic transition of Mediterranean non-member countries (MNCs) and the establishment of a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area      by promoting economic and social reforms for the modernisation of enterprises and the development of the private sector, paying particular attention to:      support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and job creation;       the opening-up of markets;       promotion of private investment, industrial cooperation and trade between the various partners;       upgrading of economic infrastructure, including the financial and taxation systems;       consolidation of the major financial balances and creation of an economic environment favourable to accelerated growth (support for structural adjustment).      4. The MEDA programme also supports       sustainable socio-economic development      , in particular through:      the participation of civil society and populations in the planning and implementation of development measures;       the improvement of social services (education, health, housing, water, etc.);       harmonious and integrated rural development, including agricultural development;       the strengthening of democracy, human rights and the rule of law;       the protection and improvement of the environment;       the upgrading of economic infrastructure, especially in the sectors of transport, energy and the information society;       the promotion of youth exchanges and cultural cooperation;       the development of human resources (vocational training, improvement of scientific and technological research).      5. In addition, MEDA       supports regional, sub-regional and cross-border cooperation      , in particular through:      the establishment and development of structures for regional cooperation between Mediterranean partners and between them and the EU and its Member States;       the establishment of the infrastructure necessary for regional trade in the areas of transport, communications and energy;       exchanges between civil society in the Community and the Mediterranean partners within the framework of decentralised cooperation through the networking of civil society actors (universities, local communities, associations, trade unions, the media, private business, non-governmental organisations, etc.).      6. The Regulation stresses that the programming and implementation of cooperation must take account of gender equality and the promotion of the role of women in economic and social life. The measures financed under the Regulation must also give due regard to environmental considerations.     7. According to the MEDA Regulation, respect for democracy, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms is an essential element of the partnership, the violation of which justifies the adoption of appropriate measures. These measures can be adopted by the Council acting by a qualified majority on a Commission proposal.      Financing      8. In order to achieve its objectives, the MEDA II programme was allocated EUR 5 350 million for the 2000-2006 period.     9. The activities financed under MEDA may take the form of technical assistance, training, institution-building, information, seminars, studies, projects for investment and action designed to highlight the Community nature of the assistance.     10. In particular, MEDA financing takes the form of:      grants managed by the European Commission and used to finance or cofinance activities, projects or programmes that contribute to the realisation of the MEDA programme's objectives;       risk capital provided and managed by the European Investment Bank (EIB) to strengthen the private sector, especially the financial sector;       interest rate subsidies for EIB loans within the framework of environmental cooperation, not exceeding a subsidy rate of 3%.      11. Community financing may cover expenditure on import of goods and services and local expenditure needed to carry out the projects and programmes envisaged. Taxes, duties and charges are excluded from Community financing. Direct financial assistance for the partner country may also be granted to support economic reform programmes within the framework of structural adjustment programmes.     12. Community financing in the production sector is combined with the beneficiary's own resources. The amount provided by the EU should not exceed 80% of the total investment costs. Community financing may also take the form of cofinancing with other bodies.     13. The beneficiaries of MEDA financing may include not only states and regions but also local authorities, regional organisations, public agencies, local communities, organisations supporting business, private operators, cooperatives, mutual societies, associations, foundations and non-governmental organisations in the EU and the Mediterranean partners.      Programming      14. The Commission plays an important role in ensuring the effective coordination of the assistance efforts undertaken by the Community, including the EIB, and individual Member States, in order to increase the coherence and complementarity of their cooperation programmes. In addition, the Commission promotes coordination and cooperation with international financial institutions and other donors.     15. Measures financed under the MEDA programme are selected taking account of the beneficiaries' priorities, evolving needs, absorption capacity and progress towards structural reform. The provisions of association or cooperation agreements are also taken into consideration.     16. Strategy papers covering the 2000-2006 period are drawn up at national and regional level in liaison with the EIB. These strategy papers aim to define the objectives of cooperation in the long term and determine the priority areas of action.     17. National Indicative Programmes (NIPs) and Regional Indicative Programmes (RIPs) covering a three-year period are then drawn up on the basis of the strategy papers and agreed by the EU and each Mediterranean partner. These programmes define the main objectives of, the guidelines for, and the priority sectors of Community support together with factors for the evaluation of the programmes. The programmes include indicative amounts and list the criteria for funding the programme concerned. They may be updated annually and adapted to changes in each partner country.     18. Finally, financing decisions are drawn up annually on the basis of the national and regional indicative programmes in liaison with the EIB. They contain a list of the projects to be financed.      Procedures      19. The strategy papers, indicative programmes and financing decisions are adopted by the Commission, according to the management procedure, following consultation of the MED Committee, composed of representatives of the Member States and chaired by the Commission representative. For greater efficiency, financing decisions totalling less than EUR 2 million are taken by the Commission, which then informs the MED Committee immediately.     20. Decisions on interest rate subsidies are taken by the Commission, which informs the EIB of any such decisions. The EIB decides on the allocation of risk capital following approval by a committee composed of representatives of the Member States and informs the Commission accordingly.     21. The actions and programmes financed under MEDA are subject to the award of contracts through tendering procedures which are open on equal terms to all natural and legal persons in the EU Member States and the Mediterranean partners. The Commission ensures the necessary transparency and effective competition in the award of these contracts and maximum dissemination of the relevant information through the       Official Journal of the European Communities      and the Internet.     22. Contracts are awarded in accordance with the relevant provisions of the EC Financial Regulation, taking into account the principles of sound financial management, economy and cost-effectiveness.      Monitoring and evaluation      23. In addition to an overall assessment report and a mid-term evaluation, the Commission, in collaboration with the EIB, submits an annual report to the European Parliament and the Council summarising the actions financed during the year and assessing the results obtained in relation to the strategy papers. This assessment is now included in the Commission's annual report on EC development policy and the implementation of external aid (2001 report) [       PDF      ].     24. No later than 31 December 2005, the Commission must submit to the Council an evaluation report accompanied by proposals regarding the future of the MEDA programme with a view to its review by the Council.

summary of   Directive 64/432/EEC on animal health problems affecting intra-EU trade in bovine animals and swine   what is the aim of the directive   It sets out rules for trade within the European Union (EU) of bovine  *  animals or swine  *  for breeding, milk or meat production, slaughter or exhibition.   It does not cover animals used for sporting or cultural events.   key points    The  transport  to another EU country of animals covered by the directive is only authorised if the animals:   do not show signs of disease;   have not been obtained from a prohibited or restricted source under EU or national law;   are officially identified, in accordance with EU directives and regulations;   are accompanied by a health certificate during transport;   come from a herd officially free of tuberculosis, brucellosis or enzootic bovine leukosis (applies only to bovine animals);   do not come into contact with animals of a lower health status during transport.      Vehicles  used to transport animals should  respect their well-being  and must:   be constructed so that animal waste, litter or feed does not leak from the vehicle;   be cleaned and disinfected after use and, if necessary, before any new loading of animals, using approved methods;   carry a record of location, including date and time of the movement of animals, details of animals transported, and vehicle cleaning and disinfection information, to be retained for at least 3 years.     Animals for  slaughter  must be slaughtered within 72 hours if transported directly to an abattoir, or 3 working days if they arrive via an approved assembly centre.   The suspected presence of any relevant  diseases  on the holding has to be  notified  to the competent authority.    Health certificates  have to be drawn up by the official vet after inspection.    All dealers  , their  premises  and  holdings  , must be  registered and approved  , and EU countries must introduce a system of surveillance, with penalties in order to ensure compliance.    Repeal   Directive 64/432/EEC will be repealed by  Regulation (EU) 2016/429  from 21 April 2021.   from when does it apply  It had to be incorporated into the national law of the original 6 European Economic Community (now EU) countries by 30 June 1965.   background   For more information, see:    ‘Bovine animals — Trade — Before and during dispatch’  on the European Commission's website.

act    Directive 2014/26/EU  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on collective management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online use in the internal market.   summary   The directive is designed to  improve the online licensing of music  by collective management organisations across the EU.   Collective management organisations  collect, manage and distribute earnings from the exploitation of the rights the responsibility for which rightsholders (i.e. the producers of the music) have delegated to them.  Management of copyright includes granting licences to users, monitoring the use of rights, collecting revenues and distributing them. They enable rightsholders to be  remunerated for useswhich they would not be in a position to control or enforce themselves  .  Prior to the introduction of the directive, online music service providers typically had to obtain licences for music services across the EU from separate collective management organisations in each EU country.  The directive will allow the online music service providers to  obtain licences  from collective management organisations operating across EU borders. This is called  ‘multi-territorial licensing’  . The rules for this are set out in Title III of the directive. This type of licensing is expected to give consumers  wider choice  to download music or to listen to it in streaming mode and to  encourage the development of new models of music access  . The development of legal online music services across the EU is also expected to help in the fight against online infringements of copyright.  Further information is available from the European Commission’s  Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs  website.

summary of   Directive 2007/46/EC — approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles   what is the aim of the directive  It provides EU countries with a common set of rules for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for these vehicles.  It makes  type approval compulsory  for all categories of whole vehicles, including those built in several stages. It lays down:   a harmonised framework with general technical requirements for the  type approval  of new vehicles and of systems, components and technical units designed for such vehicles, so as to facilitate their registration, sale and entry into service in the EU;   rules regarding the  sale and entry into service  of  vehicle parts and equipment  .   key points    Scope   The directive applies to cars, vans, trucks, buses and coaches, which are now covered by fully harmonised EU requirements.   Procedure    The EU type-approval system is based on the  principles of third-party approvals   *  and  mutual recognition   *  of such approvals.   Under the type-approval regime, before being put on the market, the vehicle type is tested by a national technical service in accordance with the legislation. The national approval authority then delivers the approval (‘CE certificate’) on the basis of these tests. The manufacturer may make an application for approval in any EU country.   It is sufficient that the vehicle is approved in one EU country for all vehicles of its type to be registered with no further checks throughout the EU on the basis of their certificate of conformity.   A  certificate of conformity  is a statement by the manufacturer that the vehicle conforms to EU type-approval requirements. The manufacturer has the responsibility to ensure the conformity of production to the approved type.    Technical requirements   The directive mainly covers the administrative procedure to be followed for the approval of vehicles. The actual  technical requirements  against which vehicles have to be tested are covered in other EU texts which are listed in Annex IV to the directive. For instance, these texts:   make certain features mandatory, such as:   electronic stability control;   new and improved mirrors;   daytime running lights;   side guards to prevent pedestrians and cyclists from falling under vehicles and anti-spray devices;     lay down additional requirements for buses and coaches:   emergency exits that are appropriate to vehicle capacity;   easier access for people with reduced mobility;   adequate residual space in the event of the rollover of the vehicle, etc.;     cover certain environmental obligations such as:   the standardised measure of CO  2  emissions,   pollutant emission limits,   fuel consumption,   engine power or vehicle noise emissions.     In 2017, the  European Commission  adopted Regulations (EU)  2017/1151  and (EU)  2017/1154  . These ensure that, from 1 September 2017, new car models pass new and more reliable emissions tests under real driving conditions (‘  Real Driving Emissions  ’).   from when does the directive apply  The directive entered into force on 29 October 2007. Depending on the category of vehicle, the directive’s application was phased in over the 2009–14 period. It had to become law in the EU countries by 28 April 2009.   background   For more information, see:    Emissions in the automotive sector  (  European Commission  )    Directives and regulations on motor vehicles, their trailers, systems and components  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Third-party approval:  an approval obtained from a third party such as an accredited independent body approved by each EU country.   Mutual recognition:  EU countries recognise type-approval certificates issues by the designated authorities in other EU countries.
summary of   Regulation (EU) No 139/2014 — requirements and administrative procedures related to aerodromes   what is the aim of this regulation  It introduces EU-wide requirements for managing, certifying and operating  aerodromes   *  , which replace the existing national rules on aerodrome safety.   key points    Oversight of aerodromes   Each EU country must designate a  competent authority  (or authorities):   with powers and responsibilities to certify and oversee aerodromes, as well as their staff and organisations involved;   which is (are) independent from aerodrome operators and providers of  apron management services   *  .   Staff authorised by the competent authority must have powers to perform at least the following tasks:   check records, data, procedures and any other material relevant to the execution of the certification and/or oversight task;   take away copies of or extracts from those materials;   ask for an oral explanation on-site;   enter aerodromes, relevant premises, operating sites or other relevant areas and means of transport;   perform audits, investigations, tests, exercises, assessments and inspections;   take or initiate enforcement measures as appropriate.    European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)   Under Regulation (EC) No  1108/2009  , the responsibilities of  EASA  were extended to cover aerodromes.  Within 3 months of the entry into force of Regulation (EU) No 139/2014 (the subject of this summary), EU countries must inform EASA of:   the names;   locations;    International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)  airport codes;   the names of the operators; and   the number of passengers and cargo movements;   of the aerodromes to which the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1108/2009 and in this regulation apply.   Exemptions   EU countries may  exempt  from the rules of Regulation (EU) No 139/2014 an aerodrome which handles no more than:   10,000 passengers per year; and   850 movements related to cargo operations per year.   However, they must examine the  traffic figures  of an exempted aerodrome on a  yearly basis  .   Certificates   The regulation contains rules regarding the conversion of certificates issued before 31 December 2014, under national rules, for a transitional period up until 31 December 2017.  Until  31 December 2024  , competent authorities may accept applications for a certificate including deviations from the certification specifications issued by EASA, if certain technical conditions cited in the regulation’s annexes are met. In such cases, the competent authorities must compile the evidence that those conditions are met in a  Deviation Acceptance and Action Document (DAAD)  which must be attached to the certificate. The competent authority must specify the period of validity of the DAAD and can amend, suspend or withdraw the DAAD in the event that the conditions are no longer met.   Aerodrome surroundings   EU countries must ensure that  consultations  take place on  safety impacts of proposed constructions  :   within the limits of the  obstacle limitation   *  and  obstacle protection   *  surfaces, as well as other surfaces associated with the aerodrome;   beyond the limits of the obstacle limitation and obstacle protection surfaces, as well as other surfaces associated with the aerodrome and which exceed the height set by EU countries.   They must also ensure they coordinate the  safeguarding of aerodromes  located near borders with other EU countries.  EU countries must also ensure that  consultations  are conducted with regard to  human activities and land use  such as:   developments which may create obstacle-induced turbulence that could be hazardous to aircraft operations;   the use of hazardous, confusing and misleading lights;   the use of highly reflective surfaces which may cause dazzling;   activities that may interfere with the performance of aeronautical communications, navigation and surveillance systems.    Wildlife hazard management   EU countries must:   have procedures for recording and reporting wildlife strikes to aircraft;   collect information from aircraft operators, aerodrome personnel and other sources on the presence of wildlife constituting a potential hazard to aircraft operations;   ensure wildlife hazards are evaluated on an ongoing basis by competent personnel.   They must also collect and forward wildlife strike reports to ICAO for inclusion in the  ICAO Bird Strike Information System  .   Amendment of the regulation   Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 139/2014 was amended in 2018 by Regulation (EU)  2018/401  regarding the classification of  runways  .   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 6 March 2014.   background   For more information, see:    Aerodromes  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Aerodrome:  a defined area (including any buildings, installations and equipment) on land or water or on a fixed, fixed offshore or floating structure intended to be used either wholly or in part for the arrival, departure and surface movement of aircraft.   Apron management services:  the body overseen by a competent authority which provides services managing the activities and the movement of aircraft and vehicles on an  apron  — a defined area intended to accommodate aircraft for purposes of loading or unloading passengers, mail or cargo; fuelling; parking; or maintenance.   Obstacle limitation surface:  a surface that defines the limits to which objects may project into the airspace.   Obstacle protection surface:  a surface established for visual approach slope indicator system above which objects or extensions of existing objects shall not be permitted except when, in the opinion of the appropriate authority, the new object or extension would be shielded by an existing immovable object.
act   Council Regulation (EC) No  1083/2006  of 11 July 2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 [  See amending acts  ].   summary   The aim of the Regulation is to strengthen economic and social cohesion in order to promote the harmonious, balanced and sustainable development of the European Union (EU) regions for the period 2007-2013. European cohesion policy aims to respond to the challenges linked to economic, social and territorial inequalities, the acceleration of economic restructuring and the ageing of the population.  This Regulation:   defines the context for cohesion policy (including the  Community strategic guidelines  for cohesion, growth and employment);   defines the objectives to which the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund (hereinafter referred to as the Funds) are to contribute;   defines the criteria Member States and regions must meet to be eligible for the Funds;   defines the financial resources available and the criteria for allocating them;   defines the principles and lays down the rules on partnership, programming, evaluation, management, monitoring and inspection on the basis of responsibilities shared between the Member States and the Commission.    THREE NEW OBJECTIVES   A total of EUR 308.041 billion was allocated to financing regional policy between 2007 and 2013 to work towards the three new objectives: Convergence, Regional Competitiveness and Employment and Territorial Cooperation. These objectives will supersede the former Objectives  1  ,  2  and  3  for the 2000-2006 programming period.   Convergence   The Convergence objective is quite close to the previous Objective 1. It aims to help the least-developed Member States and regions catch up more quickly with the EU average by  improving conditions for growth and employment  . It covers the Member States and regions whose development is lagging behind. The fields of action will be physical and human capital, innovation, knowledge-based society, adaptability to change, the environment and administrative effectiveness. It will be financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Cohesion Fund.  The total resources allocated to this objective for this period are EUR 251.163 billion, equivalent to 81.54 % of the total. The following are eligible:   for the  Structural Funds  (ERDF and ESF):   for the  Cohesion Fund  : Member States whose per capita Gross National Income (GNI) is below 90 % of the European average and which are running economic convergence programmes. They will receive 23.22 % of the resources allocated for this objective. Regions where per capita GNI has risen to above 90 % of the European average (due to the statistical effect of EU enlargement including more deprived regions) will benefit from transitional, specific and degressive financing;   for  specific financing from the ERDF  : the outermost regions. The aim is to facilitate their integration into the internal market and to take account of their specific constraints (such as compensation for excess costs due to their remote location).   For this objective, the following ceilings apply to co-financing rates:   75 % of public expenditure co-financed by the ERDF or the ESF. The ceiling can be raised to 80 % where the eligible regions are located in a Member State covered by the Cohesion Fund, and even to 85 % in the case of the outermost regions;   85 % of public expenditure co-financed by the Cohesion Fund;   50 % of public expenditure co-financed in the outermost regions (a new additional allocation from the ERDF to compensate for excess costs).    Regional Competitiveness and Employment   The Regional Competitiveness and Employment objective aims to strengthen the  competitiveness, employment and attractiveness of regions  other than those which are the most disadvantaged. It must help to anticipate economic and social changes, promote innovation, entrepreneurship, protection of the environment, accessibility, adaptability and the development of inclusive labour markets. It will be financed by the ERDF and the ESF.  The eligible regions are:   regions which fell under Objective 1 during the period 2000-06, which no longer meet the regional eligibility criteria of the Convergence objective, and which consequently benefit from transitional support. The Commission will produce a list of these regions. Once adopted, the list will be valid from 2007 to 2013;   all other EU regions not covered by the Convergence objective.   With regard to the programmes financed by the ESF, the Commission proposes four priorities within the European Employment Strategy (EES): to improve the adaptability of workers and businesses, to increase social inclusion, to improve access to employment and to implement reforms in the fields of employment and inclusion.  The resources intended for this objective total EUR 49.13 billion, equivalent to 15.95 % of the total and divided equally between the ERDF and the ESF. Of this amount:   78.86 % is intended for the regions not covered by the Convergence objective.   21.14 % is earmarked for transitional degressive support.   Under this objective, measures can be co-financed up to 50 % of public expenditure. The ceiling is 85 % for the outermost regions.   European Territorial Cooperation   The European Territorial Cooperation objective aims to strengthen cross-border, transnational and inter-regional cooperation. It is based on the old European  INTERREG  initiative and will be financed by the ERDF. It aims to promote common solutions for neighbouring authorities in the fields of urban, rural and coastal development, the development of economic relations and the creation of networks of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Cooperation will be based around research, development, information society, the environment, risk prevention and integrated water management.  13 Regions eligible for funding are those regions at  NUTS III  level which are situated along internal land borders, certain external land borders and certain regions situated along maritime borders separated by a maximum of 150 km. The Commission will adopt a list of eligible regions.  In the case of networks of cooperation and exchange of experience, the entire EU territory is eligible. The ceiling for co-financing is 75 % of public expenditure.  The resources intended for this objective total EUR 7.75 billion, equivalent to 2.52 % of the total, fully covered by the ERDF. This amount will be distributed between the different components as follows:   73.86 % for financing cross-border cooperation;   20.95 % for financing transnational cooperation;   5.19 % for financing interregional cooperation.    PROVISIONS SPECIFIC TO THE THREE OBJECTIVES    Principles of operation   The Funds will provide assistance which  complements national action  , including action at regional and local levels. The Commission and the Member States will ensure that assistance from the Funds is consistent with the activities, policies and priorities of the EU and complementary to other European financial instruments.  The objectives of the Funds will be pursued according to multiannual programming and close cooperation between the Commission and each Member State.   Strategic approach   The Council adopts the  Community strategic guidelines for Cohesion  which define the priorities and objectives of the cohesion policy for the period 2007-2013. They therefore contribute to the coherent and effective implementation of the structural funds  Based on these guidelines, Member States then adopt a  national strategic reference framework  . This framework therefore serves as the base for programming actions financed by the Funds. It ensures that interventions of the funds are in-line with the strategic guidelines.   Operational programmes   The Member States'  operational programmes  covered the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013.Operational programmes deal with only one of the three objectives and receive financing from a single Fund. The Commission appraises each programme proposed to determine whether it contributes to the objectives and priorities of:   the national strategic reference framework;    the Community strategic guidelines on cohesion.    Operational programmes relating to the Convergence and Regional Competitiveness and Employment objectives must include:   justification for the priorities in view of the strategic guidelines on cohesion and the national strategic reference framework;   information on the priority areas and their specific objectives;   a financing plan;   the implementing provisions for the operational programme;   a list of major projects linked to an operation comprising a set of works, activities or services whose total cost exceeds EUR 25 million in the case of the environment and EUR 50 million in the other fields.    Management, monitoring and inspections   Member States are be responsible for the management and control of operational programmes. They must ensure that the management and control systems are set up in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation. They have to prevent, detect and correct irregularities and recover amounts unduly paid.  The management and control systems of operational programmes set up by Member States must provide for:   the definition of the functions of the bodies involved in management and control;   compliance with the principle of separation of functions between these bodies;   procedures for ensuring the correctness and regularity of expenditure declared under the operational programme;   reliable accounting, monitoring and financial reporting systems;   a system of reporting and monitoring where the responsible body entrusts the execution of tasks to another body;   arrangements for auditing the functioning of the systems;   systems and procedures to ensure an adequate audit trail;   reporting and monitoring procedures for irregularities and the recovery of amounts unduly paid.   For each operational programme, the Member State must designate the following:   a managing authority (a national, regional or local public authority or a public or private body which manages the operational programme);   a certifying authority (a national, regional or local public authority or body which certifies statements of expenditure and applications for payment before they are sent to the Commission);   an audit authority (a national, regional or local public authority or body designated for each operational programme and responsible for verifying the effective functioning of the management and control system).    Information and publicity   The Member States and the managing authority for the operational programme have to provide information on and publicise operations and programmes which receive co-financing. The information must be addressed to EU citizens and the beneficiaries, with the aim of highlighting the role of the Community and ensuring that assistance from the Funds is transparent.   BACKGROUND   The other provisions on cohesion policy for the period 2007-2013 are set out in the four specific regulations on:   the  European Regional Development Fund  (ERDF);   the  European Social Fund  (ESF);   the  Cohesion Fund  ;   the  European grouping of cross-border cooperation  (EGCC).   Politically speaking, the financial basis of the cohesion policy for 2007-2013 is the Interinstitutional Agreement and the  Financial Framework for 2007-2013  .

summary of   Directive (EU) 2017/1371 — using criminal law to protect the EU’s financial interests   what is the aim of the directive   To create  a stronger and more harmonised system  , with minimum common rules,  to fight crime affecting the EU budget  .   To better protect the  EU’s financial interests and taxpayers’ money  across the EU.   key points    Scope   The directive concerns:    fraud  and other criminal offences, such as corruption, misappropriation or money laundering, affecting the EU’s financial interests — i.e. the   EU budget   , the budgets of the   EU institutions, bodies  ,  offices and agencies   established by the  treaties  , or the budgets  directly or indirectly managed and monitored  by them;    ‘serious offences’  against the  common value added tax (VAT) system  , like VAT carousels  *  (offences considered to be serious when they are connected with the territory of two or more EU countries and involve a total damage of at least €10,000,000).   It also sets out common rules on  sanctions  and  limitation periods  in relation to the criminal offences covered by this directive.   Definitions   Each of the following offences is given a definition at EU level:    fraud  committed intentionally — what is regarded as fraud in respect of expenditure as  procurement  and  non-procurement  as well as of revenue arising from VAT  own resources  and other revenue;    money laundering  as defined in Directive (EU)  2015/849  ;   passive and active corruption committed intentionally;    misappropriation  committed intentionally.   What is meant by  ‘public officials’  — EU and national (including in EU countries) — is specified in the definitions of money laundering, corruption and misappropriation.  The criminal offences as defined in the directive fall within the material competence of the newly established  European Public Prosecutor’s Office  , an independent EU body empowered to investigate and prosecute these crimes and bring them to judgment before competent national courts.   Common approach   In all  EU countries (except Denmark and the United Kingdom (   1   ))  :   these offences are all to be punished as  criminal offences  , as are their  attempt  as well as their  incitement, aiding and abetting  ;    legal persons   *  should be held  liable  for any of the criminal offences committed for their benefit — not excluding the possibility of criminal proceedings against natural persons who are the perpetrators or who are solely responsible.    Sanctions   The directive provides for minimum ‘effective, proportionate and dissuasive’ criminal sanctions.  These include a maximum penalty of  at least 4 years of imprisonment  :   where the financial damage to the EU budget is above the  threshold of €100.000  ;   in any case of serious offences against the common VAT system;   other serious circumstances defined under national law.   Where a criminal offence involves damages of  below €10.000  , EU countries may introduce sanctions that are not criminal.  Regarding  legal persons  , the directive envisages various other types of sanctions in addition to fines (criminal and non-criminal).  Offences committed within a  criminal organisation  within the meaning of Framework Decision  2008/841/JHA  constitute an  aggravating circumstance  .  These sanctions do not exclude:   the possibility of  more severe sanctions in national legislation  ;   the exercise of  disciplinary powers  by the competent authorities against public officials.   The directive also deals with the following:   the  freezing and confiscation  of means and proceeds from the criminal offences that affect the EU budget;   establishing  jurisdiction  for such offences;    minimum limitation periods  enabling  investigations and prosecutions  as well as allowing the  enforcement of the penalties  imposed following a conviction for a commission of these offences.    Cooperation between EU countries and EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies    The EU countries,  Eurojust  , the  European Public Prosecutor’s Office  and the Commission’s European Anti-Fraud Office (  OLAF  ) must cooperate against the criminal offences covered by this directive. OLAF and, where appropriate, Eurojust provide technical and operational assistance to facilitate the coordination of the EU countries’ investigations.   If the  Court of Auditors  and auditors responsible for auditing the budgets of the EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies or other budgets managed and audited by the institutions, find anything that could qualify as a criminal offence under this directive, they must inform the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, OLAF and the other competent authorities. EU countries must ensure that national audit bodies do the same.   from when does the directive apply  EU countries have to incorporate it into national law by 6 July 2019.   background    Article 325  of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union obliges the EU and EU countries to counter fraud and any other illegal activities affecting the EU’s financial interests with measures that act as a deterrent.  More than 90% of the EU budget is managed nationally. Damage to the EU budget resulting from crime and other illegal activities amounts to hundreds of millions of euros each year and is of serious concern. In 2011, the Commission adopted a  communication  which contained proposals to improve the protection of EU financial interests (see  IP/11/644  ).

The sellers then disappear without paying the VAT to the tax authorities.   Legal person:  an entity recognised by the law as being entitled to rights and duties in the same way as a natural or human person, the common example being a company.
summary of   Directive 89/556/EEC — animal health conditions governing intra-EU trade in and importation from non-EU countries of cattle embryos   what is the aim of the directive   It lays down  animal health conditions  for trade in embryos of domestic cattle between EU countries and their import from non-EU countries.   By this means, it aims to reduce the risk of spreading animal diseases.   key points    Embryos for  intra-EU trade  must meet conditions concerning conception, collection, production, processing, storage and certification. They must be accompanied during transport by a  health certificate  certifying that they comply with this directive.   The directive envisages a system for  approving the embryo collection and production teams  in the EU countries and in non-EU countries. Each team is registered by the competent authority of the country concerned and receives a veterinary registration number.   The  list of embryo collection and production teams  is regularly updated by each EU country, then sent to the other EU countries and the public.    Imports of embryos  from non-EU countries are restricted to those:   from countries listed in accordance with a procedure provided for in Article 18 of the directive with regard to certain criteria, such as   the health of the livestock;   information on contagious diseases;   preventing and combating animal diseases;   the structure of veterinary services;   the guarantees provided;     collected or produced by approved and listed embryo collection and production teams by competent authorities.     The directive provides for  safeguard and control measures  in the country of collection and the destination country.    Repeal   Regulation (EU)  2016/429  repeals and replaces Directive 89/556/EEC with effect from 21 April 2021.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 29 September 1989. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 1 January 1991.   background   For more information, see:    ‘Bovine’  on the European Commission’s food safety website    Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/466 of 30 March 2020 on temporary measures to contain risks to human, animal and plant health and animal welfare during certain serious disruptions of Member States’ control systems due to coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
   Overall strategic approach     Overall strategic approach     The aim of this communication is to develop an overall anti-fraud strategy around four challenges: an overall anti-fraud legislative policy, a new culture of operational cooperation, an inter-institutional approach to prevent and combat corruption and the enhancement of the criminal law dimension.     ACT     Commission communication of 28 June 2000 - Protection of the Communities’ financial interests - The fight against fraud - For an overall strategic approach [       COM (2000) 358      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Given that the protection of the Community budget is the responsibility of the European institutions and the Member States, the Commission’s aim in this communication is to develop an overall strategic approach based on coordination, the key concept of Article 280 of the EC Treaty, with a view to affording effective and equivalent protection of financial interests Community-wide.     Since 1994, the Community approach to the fight against fraud has been pro-active and designed to develop a legislative framework covering all areas of protection of financial interests. This framework includes:      the         convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests        (1995) and its Protocols of 1996 and 1997;       the Convention on the fight against         corruption involving officials        of the European Communities or officials of Member States of the European Union (1997);       the Regulation relating to the         protection of the European Communities' financial interests        (1995) and the Regulation concerning         on-the-spot checks and inspections        carried out by the Commission in order to protect the European Communities’ financial interests against fraud and other irregularities (1996);       the establishment of the         European Anti-Fraud Office        (OLAF) in 1999.      In addition, the Commission, in response to its White Paper on reform, has decentralised the financial control function, set up an internal audit service and established working groups involving OLAF and all Commission departments.     Enlargement, the area of freedom, security and justice referred to in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the gradual abolition of national borders call for an overall and integrated approach based on a strengthened culture of cooperation.      Strategic guidelines      As part of this overall approach, the Commission is proposing a multiannual strategy around four main strategic guidelines to meet the principal challenges.     The first of these relates to an       overall legislative anti-fraud policy      in four parts:      prevention by means of clear and easily applicable legislation and including sufficiently dissuasive provisions. The Commission also hopes to increase the accountability of officials and is proposing that OLAF, the national authorities and professional circles be involved in prevention;       0detection by strengthening the means and legal instruments for detection, controls and sanctions. The Commission therefore recommends continuing the effort to define precisely irregular conduct and illegal activities with a view to facilitating cooperation and the effective application of penalties. At the same time, it advocates extending information exchanges and control measures, in particular in connected or especially vulnerable sectors such as money laundering, public procurement and the granting of subsidies. This is to be backed up by an extended system of administrative penalties;       follow-up by ensuring more effective management of administrative and financial follow-up in order         inter alia        to improve the recovery of unduly received or evaded amounts. The financial correction instruments at the Community’s disposal should also be applied with the aim of motivating Member States to put in place effective national control systems;       cooperation in order to establish a single legal basis for combating fraud with a view to simplifying and clarifying the rules on participation in national investigations. Provision also needs to be made for a cooperation and mutual assistance system to fight fraud that is similar to that which already exists in certain areas such as the agricultural and customs policies, while cooperation with applicant countries and non-member countries needs to be strengthened.      The second challenge is to create a       new culture of operational cooperation      . The Commission is attempting to become more pro-active in its activities on the ground. This involves having an overall view of the economic and criminal environment and enhancing the exploitation and analysis of intelligence. For that purpose, technology and the information sources available must be improved and, in particular, OLAF must serve as a crossroads for gathering and analysing information and as a Community platform of services. Strengthened cooperation with the applicant countries is mentioned again. Lastly, the Commission undertakes to pursue a policy of permanent evaluation of anti-fraud action in order to measure the progress made.     The third challenge is to adopt an       inter-institutional approach to prevent and combat corruption      . The credibility of Community policies must be strengthened by safeguarding the integrity of the European public service and of the members of the institutions. OLAF must:      cooperate closely on the basis of loyal cooperation and consistency of the duties of each of the participants in the fight against fraud;       contribute more to training measures focusing on training and awareness-raising activities involving all staff, in particular those responsible for procurement or grants and providing a system of values;       encourage transparency and the duty to communicate;       complement its task of conducting administrative investigations with fair and effective penalties. Office action will have to be geared to the objective of "zero tolerance" and compliance with information obligations will be crucial for its effectiveness.      The fourth and last challenge is to       enhance the criminal judicial dimension      . National criminal policies should be adapted to the new Treaty provisions and assistance sought from the European institutions to improve the cooperation function. The Community already possesses the legal instruments to improve the detection of offences and provide the national judicial authorities with the means to process cases of fraud under criminal law. However, they are often not used because of obstacles such as the non-compatibility of national legal systems or technical specifications.     Lastly, in order to resolve problems arising from the various national systems regarding criminal offences linked to fraud, the conditions under which judicial assistance operates must be improved. OLAF must therefore develop its liaison and expertise function in this area.     RELATED ACTS      Commission report to the European Parliament and the Council of 6 July 2007 – Protection of the European Communities' financial interests – Fight against fraud – Annual report 2006 [         COM(2007) 390        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      This report, which has been produced by the Commission in cooperation with the Member States, presents the measures taken in 2006 to meet the obligations provided for in Article 280 of the EC Treaty. It contains statistics concerning irregularities reported by Member States and gives an account of the measures taken and results obtained in preventing and fighting fraud and in recovering amounts not collected or wrongly paid. In particular, the report covers four specific areas: risk analysis and management; debarment and early-warning databases; warning systems involving internal informers; and mechanisms for recovery by offsetting.      Commission report to the European Parliament and the Council of 12 July 2006 - Protection of the Communities’ financial interests - Fight against fraud - Annual report 2005 [         COM(2006) 378        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      In this report the European Commission evaluates its overall strategic approach for the protection of the Communities' financial interests in the five years 2001-2005. Overall, implementation of the programmed objectives and actions was satisfactory. The report summarises the statistics on fraud and other irregularities notified by the Member States and records the measures taken by the Member States in 2005 and the Commission's efforts to improve the effectiveness of OLAF. It also contains a section on improving the recovery of amounts not levied or wrongly paid out. The report also covers the issue of certifying the accounts.

   Partnership for the accession of Slovenia     Partnership for the accession of Slovenia     The aim of the Accession Partnership is to assist the authorities in the candidate country in their efforts to comply with the accession criteria. It covers in detail the priorities for accession preparations, in particular implementing the acquis, and forms the basis for programming pre-accession assistance from Community funds such as the Phare programme. Following the signing of the Accession Treaty on 16 April 2003 and the official integration of the country into the European Union on 1 May 2004, the accession partnership has come to an end.     In its communication "       Agenda 2000      ", the European Commission has set out a range of proposals for strengthening the pre-accession strategy for all the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The general objective of this strategy is to offer a coherent programme for preparing these countries for membership of the European Union, and more particularly:      to bring together the various forms of aid offered by the European Union within a single framework, the accession partnerships,       to familiarise applicants with the European Union's procedures and policies by offering them the opportunity to participate in Community programmes.      1) OBJECTIVE     The objective of the accession partnership (approved in March 1998 and amended in December 1999 and January 2002) is to set down in law the working priorities defined in the Commission opinion on Slovenia's application for membership, the financial resources available to help Slovenia implement these priorities and the conditions attached to this aid. The partnership provides a framework for a range of instruments designed to support candidate countries' efforts to prepare for membership.     These instruments include a national programme for the adoption of the Community acquis (NPAA) (revised in May 2002), joint evaluation of medium-term economic policy priorities, the pact against organised crime, the national development plan and other sectoral programmes necessary for participation in the Structural Funds after accession and implementation of       ISPA      and       SAPARD      beforehand. In 2002, the partnership for accession served as the starting point for preparing an action plan to reinforce the administrative and judicial capacity of Slovenia.     Though these instruments will not be an integral part of the partnership, their priorities will be compatible with it.     Implementation of the partnership for accession will be monitored under the Europe Agreement between the European Union and Slovenia.     2) PRIORITIES     There are short- and medium-term priorities. Short-term priorities are issues that Slovenia was likely to resolve or make headway with during 2000. The medium-term priorities should be dealt with fully by the end of 2003.     Slovenia has partly achieved the economic and political criteria priorities. It has totally or largely achieved the priorities linked to the free movement of persons, the free movement of capital, agriculture, social affairs and employment, energy, customs union, foreign affairs and financial control. Most of the other priorities of the partnership have been partly achieved.     The priorities for the accession partnership were revised in December 1999 (see p.3 of the Annex to Decision       1999/859/EC)      . A final revision was published in February 2002 (Decision 2002/94/EC). This forms the basis of the Commission's evaluation in its 2002 report.     The priority areas are now:     (for up-to-date information on this subject, please refer to the Adoption of the Community acquis section)       economic reform         institutional and administrative capacity building         internal market         property law         environment         political criteria         economic policy         justice and home affairs         nuclear safety         agriculture - fisheries         transport         employment and social affairs         regional policy and cohesion       3) FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK      Phare      The 2000       Phare programme      allocated EUR 33.4 million. A further EUR 7 million were allocated for cross-border cooperation programmes. Phare 2001 allocated EUR 21.3 million for Slovenia. A further EUR 7 million were provided for cross-border cooperation. Phare 2002 allocated EUR 18 million to Slovenia, plus an envelope of EUR 16.9 million under the additional facility to reinforce the institutions. This was supplemented by a further envelope of EUR 7 million for cross-border cooperation with its neighbours.     The partner country's authorities are responsible for aid-related contracts and payments. However, the Financial Regulation of the European Communities requires the Commission to supervise contracting procedures and approve Phare contracts signed by the partner country before they enter into force.      Pre-accession aid      From 2000, financial assistance has included aid for agriculture and rural development (       SAPARD      ) and a structural instrument (       ISPA      ) according priority to transport and environmental measures. The Regulation of June 1999 coordinating aid under Phare, SAPARD and ISPA allows the Commission to exercise ex-post supervision over contracts if dissatisfied with the partner country's own financial control.     Financial assistance for the period 2000-02 was broken down as follows: EUR 25 million a year under Phare, EUR 6.5 million a year under SAPARD and EUR 10.8-21.7 million a year under ISPA. SAPARD 2002 allocated EUR 6.6 million to Slovenia. The ISPA envelope for 2002 was between EUR 10.9 and 21.8 million.     4) REFERENCES      Decision         98/268/EC        of 30 March 1998Official Journal L 121 of 23.04.1998       Decision         1999/859/EC        of 6 December 1999Official Journal L 335 of 28.12.1999       Commission Opinion COM(97) 2010 finalNot published in the Official Journal       Commission Report COM(98) 709 finalNot published in the Official Journal       Commission Report COM(1999) 512 finalNot published in the Official Journal       Commission Report COM(2000) 712 finalNot published in the Official Journal       Commission Report COM(2001) 700 final - SEC(2001)1755Not published in the Official Journal       Decision 2002/94/EC of 28 January 2002Official Journal L 44 of 14.02.2002       Commission Report COM(2002) 700 final - SEC(2002)1411Not published in the Official Journal       Treaty of Accession to the European Union [Official Journal L 236, 23.09.2003]      Last updated: 19.11.2004  
   Towards the establishment of a European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps     Towards the establishment of a European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps     A new European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps is to be established as a framework for the involvement of citizens in operations of the European Union (EU). The Corps is to contribute to the EU’s overall response to humanitarian disasters.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council of 23 November 2010 - How to express EU citizen's solidarity through volunteering: First reflections on a European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps [       COM(2010) 683      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The Lisbon Treaty provides for the establishment of a European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps (EVHAC). To this end, the Commission examines the best approaches for its establishment, in particular concerning the identification and recruitment of volunteers, their training and their deployment.      Guiding principles      The EVHAC must respect and promote the principles of:      solidarity with people affected by disasters and cohesion of European society;       humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence, as set out in the         European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid        ;       professionalism and safety, in order to meet needs in a rapid and operational manner, especially in conflict areas;       coordination and cooperation with existing humanitarian organisations and structures.       Establishment      The establishment of the EVHAC must take advantage of the experience gained from existing volunteering schemes. The new Corps must bring added value to the conduct of the EU’s humanitarian aid operations.     Its functioning must also meet the       needs of humanitarian organisations      and the       conditions of operation      of voluntary organisations. From this perspective, the Commission proposes in particular to:      develop critera for the identification of volunteers;       establish training programmes based on common standards and good practices, as well as on conditions in countries and specific situations;       establish stand-by rosters of experienced volunteers to ensure the smooth functioning of emergency operations;       strengthen support to back-up functions in implementing organisations;       improve advocacy for European citizens.      The EVHAC must receive       specific financing      , since its budget is not to be diverted from the core operational budget for the victims of humanitarian disasters. It must operate under increased       security conditions      , especially where interventions take place in areas affected by conflicts.     Finally, its scope of intervention must not be limited to emergencies but be extended to operations in the area of supporting local capacities, reconstruction and post-disaster recovery. The establishment of the EVHAC should make it possible to encourage twinning and exchanges with local organisations in third countries.      Context      The voluntary sector has evolved rapidly in the last decade. A large number of organisations offer schemes open to European citizens, including the Commission-driven       European Voluntary Service      (EVS) and the       United Nations Volunteers Programme      .     On the occasion of the       European Year of Voluntary Activities      , several stages are to lead to the establishment of the EVHAC. Following public consultation, the Commission intends to table a legislative proposal in 2012.     Last updated: 17.02.2011  
   Early exchange of information in the event of a radiological emergency     Early exchange of information in the event of a radiological emergency     This decision introduces a framework for the early exchange of information between countries in the event of a radiological emergency: the "Ecurie" system.     ACT     Council Decision       87/600/EEC      of 14 December 1987 on Community arrangements for the early exchange of information in the event of a radiological emergency.     SUMMARY     This decision introduces the "Ecurie" system. This system requires Member States to notify and provide information to the Commmission and to the Member States affected or liable to be affected whenever a Member State decides to take measures of a widespread nature in order to protect the general public in the event of a radiological emergency.     Such information must include the nature and time of the event, its exact location and the nature of the facility or activity involved, the cause, the foreseeable development and the protective measures taken or planned. This information must subsequently be supplemented by any further relevant information.     Upon receipt of this information, Member States are required to inform the Commission of the measures taken and Recommendations issued or envisaged and, at appropriate intervals, of the levels of radioactivity measured by their monitoring facilities in foodstuffs, feedingstuffs, drinking water and the environment. The Commission must then forward that information, plus information it receives from non-Community countries, to the competent authorities of all the other Member States.

   Dangers arising from ionising radiation     Dangers arising from ionising radiation     This Directive is designed to establish uniform safety standards to protect the health of workers and the general public against the dangers of ionising radiation.     ACT     Council Directive       96/29/Euratom      of 13 May 1996 laying down basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation.     SUMMARY     Title I defines all of the technical terms to be found in the document.     The Directive applies to all practices which involve a risk from ionising radiation, either from an artificial source or from a natural source where natural radionuclides are processed because of their radioactive, fissile or fertile properties.     Each Member State must require the use of these practices to be reported, except in exceptional cases as specified in the Directive.     Each Member State must require prior authorisation to be obtained for practices that may involve a risk of ionising radiation, subject to the exceptions provided for in the Directive.     Prior authorisation is required for the disposal, recycling or reuse of radioactive substances or materials containing radioactive substances resulting from any practice subject to compulsory reporting or authorisation, unless the clearance levels established by the competent national authorities are complied with.     Before they are adopted or approved for the first time, Member States must ensure that all new classes or types of practices resulting in exposure to ionising radiation are justified on the basis that their economic, social or other benefits outweigh any adverse effects they may have on health.     Member States shall not permit radioactive substances to be deliberately added during the production of foodstuffs, toys, personal ornaments or cosmetics, neither shall they permit such goods to be imported or exported.     Where appropriate, efforts to ensure optimum radiological protection should include dose constraints.     Persons under the age of 18 may not be assigned to any work which would make them exposed workers.     The effective dose for exposed workers is limited to 100 mSv over a period of five consecutive years and must not exceed 50 mSv in any one year.     As soon as a pregnant woman or nursing mother informs an undertaking of her situation, she may not be assigned to work involving a significant risk of bodily radioactive contamination.     In exceptional circumstances, excluding radiological emergencies, to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, the competent authorities may, where specific operations so require, authorise a certain number of designated workers to exceed the individual occupational exposure limits.     Each Member State must take reasonable steps to ensure that the contribution made by each practice to the exposure of the population as a whole is kept as low as reasonably achievable in view of the economic and social factors. The total of all such contributions must be assessed regularly.     The Directive establishes exposure prevention measures:      the competent authorities must draw up appropriate guidelines for classifying controlled and supervised areas in a given situation, and undertakings must monitor working conditions closely within these areas;       Member States must require undertakings to provide information to workers who fall into either of the two distinct categories of exposed workers;       the undertaking is responsible for assessing and implementing arrangements for the radiological protection of exposed workers.      Exposure assessment involves monitoring the workplace (measuring external dose rates and indicating the nature and quality of the radiation in question, as well as measuring the air concentration and surface density of contaminating radioactive substances and indicating their nature and their physical and chemical states), monitoring the individual (systematic for the most exposed workers) and monitoring in the event of accidental or emergency exposure.     The medical surveillance of exposed workers is to be based on the principles that govern occupational medicine generally.     Each Member State must determine the procedure for appealing against findings and decisions made on the basis of the Directive.     Each Member State must:      establish one or more systems for carrying out inspections in order to enforce the provisions introduced under the Directive, as well as to initiate monitoring and intervene whenever necessary;       require workers to be given access, at their request, to the results of any individual monitoring relating to them;       require the necessary means for proper radiation protection to be made available to the units responsible.      Each Member State must create the conditions necessary to ensure optimum protection of the population and to apply the fundamental principles governing operational protection of the population.     Member States must ensure that consideration is given to the fact that radiological emergencies may occur in connection with practices carried out within or outside their territory and that these may affect them. Each Member State must ensure that appropriate action plans are drawn up at national or local level, and that these are tested at regular intervals.     If a Member State intends to adopt provisions which are stricter than those laid down by the Directive, it must inform the Commission and the other Member States.

The EU operates a system of prior authorisation for all shipments of radioactive waste in order to provide greater protection against the dangers of ionising radiation.

   Objective 2     Objective 2     The main goal of regional policy in the European Union is economic and social cohesion. This is based on financial solidarity, whereby more than 35 % of the Union's budget is transferred to the less-favoured regions (EUR 213 billion in 2000-06 plus EUR 21.74 billion approved for the ten new Member States). Those regions in the Union lagging behind in their development, undergoing restructuring or facing specific geographical, economic or social problems are to be put in a better position to cope with their difficulties and to benefit fully from the opportunities offered by the single market.     The amount of support that regions receive through the EU's regional policy depends on their level of development and the type of difficulties they are facing.       The Structural Fund regulations      for 2000-06 provide, in particular, for three priority objectives:        Objective 1          :        to promote the development and structural adjustment of regions whose development is lagging behind;        Objective 2:        to support the economic and social conversion of areas experiencing structural difficulties;         Objective 3          :        to support the adaptation and modernisation of education, training and employment policies and systems in regions not eligible under Objective 1.      This information sheet concerns Objective 2 only. The other Objectives are the subject of separate sheets.      GEOGRAPHICAL ELIGIBILITY       The reform of the Structural Funds      under       Agenda 2000      recommends concentrating structural assistance on the most pressing development problems. The new Objective 2 of the Structural Funds for 2000-06 brings together the former Objectives 2 (conversion of declining industrial regions) and 5(b) (development of rural areas) from 1994-99.     Like Objective 1, Objective 2 is "regionalised", meaning that it applies to areas defined according to specific statistical and socio-economic criteria. Since the regions covered by this Objective are facing structural difficulties, the Community assistance they receive is intended to support their economic and social conversion. Eligibility depends on a population ceiling, and on criteria specific to each area. An exhaustive list is then drawn up of the eligible regions.      Population ceiling      The population of all the areas eligible for Objective 2 of the Structural Funds may not be more than 18 % of the total population of the Community, i.e. no less than two thirds of the population previously covered by Objectives 2 and 5(b). Following enlargement, for the ten new Member States the ceiling is 31 % of the population of all the NUTS II regions covered by Objective 2 in each of those countries. Decision       1999/503/EC      [Official Journal L 194 of 27.7.1999] of 1 July 1999 requires the Commission to set a ceiling in each Member State on the population eligible for Objective 2 in 2000-06. These ceilings are as follows:         Member State             Population(million inhabitants)             % of the national population             Germany             10.30             13             Austria             1.99             25             Belgium             1.27             12             Denmark             0.54             10             Spain             8.81             22             Finland             1.58             31             France             18.77             31             Italy             7.4             13             Luxembourg             0.11             28             Netherlands             2.33             15             United Kingdom             13.84             24             Sweden             1.22             14             European Union             68.17             18         The Act concerning the conditions of accession to the European Union of the ten new Member States [OJ L 236, 23.9.2003] contains the ceilings for those countries for the period 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2006. Only three of those countries have population ceilings for obtaining aid under Objective 2. They are:      the Czech Republic: 0.37 million inhabitants       Slovakia: 0.19 million inhabitants       Cyprus: 0.21 million inhabitants       Criteria specific to each type of area      The areas eligible under Objective 2 are those undergoing socio-economic change in the industrial and service sectors, declining rural areas, urban areas in difficulty and depressed areas dependent on fisheries. The criteria for defining them are as follows.      Areas undergoing socio-economic change in the industrial and service sectors:       These areas must correspond to a         NUTS level III        territorial unit in the nomenclature developed by Eurostat.       Their average unemployment rate recorded over the three years before 1999 must have been higher than the Community average.       They must have a percentage share of industrial employment in total employment equal to or greater than the Community average in any reference year from 1985 onwards.       Industrial employment must have been falling constantly for several years.      Geographical areas whose population or area is significant, which meet the above criteria and are adjacent to an industrial area are also eligible.     These areas undergoing socio-economic change in the industrial and service sectors continue to suffer job losses, not only in the traditional industries (textiles, cars, coal and steel) but also in services. The development of new activities and retraining of workers are strongly encouraged.      Declining rural areas:       These areas must correspond to a NUTS level III territorial unit in the nomenclature developed by Eurostat.       They must have either a population density of less than 100 people per km², or a percentage share of agricultural employment in total employment which is at least double the Community average in any reference year from 1985 onwards.       They must have either an average unemployment rate recorded over the three years before 1999 that is above the Community average, or a decline in population since 1985.      Rural areas with serious socio-economic problems arising from the ageing of or decline in the agricultural working population may also be eligible.     Rural areas are undergoing radical change. Farming is no longer a major source of employment but continues to occupy most rural land. Revitalising these areas and maintaining the population there requires new competitive activities and closer links with urban centres.      Urban areas in difficulty      are densely populated areas that meet at least one of the following criteria:      a rate of long-term unemployment higher than the Community average;       a high level of poverty, including poor housing conditions;       a particularly damaged environment;       a high rate of crime and antisocial behaviour;       low educational standards among the population.      The urban issue is at the heart of economic, social and territorial change. Towns and cities have a high degree of development potential and cooperate among themselves in networks. But they are also home to many disparities in development, as witnessed by the existence of depressed districts where social exclusion and poverty are rife. However, although our towns and cities exert high pressure on the environment, they nevertheless play a role as vectors of development for surrounding rural areas.      Depressed areas dependent on fisheries      are coastal areas with a significant number of jobs in the fisheries industry as a percentage of total employment. They are also facing structural socio-economic problems relating to the restructuring of the fisheries sector, which has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of jobs in that sector.     Objective 2, therefore, concerns four types of geographical area. Areas facing or threatened by serious structural problems or a high level of unemployment arising from an ongoing or planned restructuring in agriculture, industry or the services sector are also eligible. Where there is a serious crisis in a region, the Commission may act on a proposal from a Member State to amend the list of areas during 2003, provided this does not increase the population covered within each region.      List of eligible regions      As a first step, each Member State draws up its own indicative list of significant areas, which it submits to the Commission together with the statistics and other information, at the most appropriate geographical level, needed to evaluate the proposals. The Commission, in close consultation with the Member States, then draws up the definitive list of areas eligible under Objective 2 for 2000-06 for each Member State of the European Union. The decisions containing these lists are available on the       Inforegio      website of the Directorate-General for regional policy:         Member State             Decision             Official Journal             Germany             Decision               2000/201/EC              OJ L66 of 14.3.2000             Austria             Decision               2000/289/EC              (amended by Decision               2000/607/EC)              OJ L99 of 19.04.2000(Official Journal L 258 of 12.10.2000)             Belgium             Decision               2000/119/EC              OJ L39 of 14.02.2000             Denmark             Decision               2000/121/EC              OJ L39 of 14.02.2000             Spain             Decision               2000/264/EC              OJ L84 of 05.04.2000             Finland             Decision               2000/120/EC              OJ L39 of 14.02.2000             France             Decision               2000/339/EC              (amended by Decision               2000/607/EC)              (amended by Decision               2003/679/EC)              OJ L123 of 24.05.2000(OJ L258 of 12.10.2000)(Official Journal L 249 of 01.10.2003)             Italy             Decision               2000/530/EC              (amended by Decision               2001/363/EC)              OJ L223 of 04.09.2000(OJ L129, 11.05.2001)             Luxembourg             Decision               2000/277/EC              OJ L87 of 08.04.2000             Netherlands             Decision               2000/118/EC              OJ L39 of 14.02.2000             United Kingdom             Decision               2000/290/EC              (amended by Decision               2001/201/EC)              OJ L99 of 19.04.2000(OJ L78, 16.03.2001)             Sweden             Decision               2000/220/EC              OJ L69 of 17.03.2000         Greece, Ireland and Portugal are not concerned by Objective 2, since their entire territory is covered by Objective 1. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta and Slovenia are in the same situation.     Transitional support is also available for EU 15 regions which were eligible for the former Objectives 2 and 5(b) in 1994-99 but which do not qualify for Objective 2 in 2000-06. This transitional support, which decreases over time, is granted to prevent a sudden interruption in financial assistance from the Structural Funds and consolidate the progress achieved during the previous programming period. It is granted for six years, from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2005. The transitional support for these areas is provided by the ERDF. They may also receive assistance from the       EAGGF      Guarantee Section for rural development, from the       FIFG      under the common fisheries policy, or from the European Social Fund (       ESF      ) under Objective 3 for structural conversion.      PROGRAMMING DOCUMENTS      Programming is an essential part of implementing EU regional policy. The first stage is for the Member States to present regional development plans. These include a precise description of the economic and social situation of the country by region, a description of the most appropriate strategy for achieving the stated development objectives and indications on the use and form of the financial contribution from the Structural Funds.     The Member States then submit programming documents to the Commission, following its       general guidelines      . In the case of Objective 2, these programming documents take the form of       single programming documents      (SPDs).     . The Objective 2 SPDs coordinate all Community structural assistance, including rural development measures but not including assistance for human resources granted under Objective 3. These documents describe the strategy and priorities selected and provide a short description of the proposed measures and an indicative financing plan showing the eligible public/private financing. They also lay down the arrangements for financial management, monitoring, evaluation and control. In all, 96 regional programmes are being implemented in the 12 Member States covered by Objective 2. You can consult summaries of the SPDs on the       Inforegio      website of the Directorate-General for regional policy.      FINANCIAL PROVISIONS       Funding      For 2000-06, the allocation to the Structural Funds is EUR 195 billion, to which must be added EUR 14.1559 billion for the ten new Member States for the period from accession to 31 December 2006. The allocation for Objective 2 is EUR 22.5 billion over seven years (11.5 % of the total) for the old Member States and EUR 0.12 billion over two and a half years for the new Member States (0.86 % of the total allocated to those countries), shared between the ERDF and the ESF, with EUR 2.721 billion earmarked for transitional support.     The       Cohesion Fund      grants assistance only to Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Spain, i.e. the countries whose gross domestic product (GDP) is less than 90 % of the Community average. It finances operations in the fields of environment and transport. Since the whole of Greece, Portugal and Ireland are eligible under Objective 1, only certain regions of Spain eligible under Objective 2 (Aragon, the Balearic Islands, Catalonia, Rioja, Madrid, Navarre and the Basque Country) also receive assistance from the Cohesion Fund.     Commission Decision       1999/504/EC      of 1 July 1999 [Official Journal L 194 of 27.7.1999] fixes an indicative allocation by Member State of the commitment appropriations for Objective 2 of the Structural Funds for 2000-06 as shown below:         Member State             Objective 2(million)             Transitional support(million)             Germany             2 984             526             Austria             578             102             Belgium             368             65             Denmark             156             27             Spain             2 553             98             Finland             459             30             France             5 437             613             Italy             2 145             377             Luxembourg             34             6             Netherlands             676             119             United Kingdom             3 989             706             Sweden             354             52             European Union             19 733             2 721         For the new Member States, the allocation for Objective 2 represents 0.86 % of the resources of the Structural Funds. The indicative allocation of commitment appropriations is the following:      Czech Republic: EUR 63.3 million       Slovakia: EUR 33 million       Cyprus: EUR 24. billion       Contribution of the Funds      As a general rule, the contribution of the Structural Funds under Objective 2 is subject to the following ceilings: no more than 50 % of the total eligible volume and at least 25 % of eligible public expenditure.     In the case of investment in firms, the contribution of the Funds is subject to the ceilings on the rate of aid and on combinations of aid laid down in the field of state aids.     In cases where assistance involves financing investments that will generate income (such as bridges or toll motorways), the expected revenue is taken into account when determining the contribution of the Funds. Under Objective 2, the contribution of the Funds is subject to the following ceilings:      In the case of investments in infrastructure generating substantial income, assistance may not exceed 25 % of the eligible total volume. These rates can be supplemented by forms of financing other than direct aid for up to 10 % of the total eligible total.       Contributions to investments in businesses may not exceed 15 % of the total eligible volume. In the case of investments in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), these rates can be increased by up to 10 % of the eligible total volume for indirect forms of financing.

It repeals Regulation (EC) No  868/2004  whilst strengthening the rules that regulation had set out.   key points    Scope   The regulation provides for rules relating to practices distorting competition between EU air carriers and non-EU air carriers and causing, or threatening to cause, injury  *  to EU air carriers.   Launching an investigation   Following a  written complaint  by an  EU country or an association of EU air carriers  or on its own initiative, the Commission will carry an investigation if there is clear (  prima facie  ) evidence of the following circumstances:    1.    a practice distorting competition, adopted by a non-EU country or a non-EU entity;      2.    injury or threat of injury to one or more EU air carriers; and      3.    a causal link between the alleged practice and the alleged injury or threat of injury.      The investigation    If necessary, the Commission may investigate in the territory of a non-EU country.   The investigation can be suspended if it appears more appropriate to address the unfair practice distorting competition under the  dispute settlement procedures  established by an applicable air transport or air services agreement;   the investigation can be resumed if corrective action has not been promptly taken or   the practice distorting competition has not been eliminated within 12 months from the date the investigation was suspended.     The Commission must inform the non-EU country, entity or air carrier concerned as well as the complainant, the interested parties, the EU countries and the EU air carriers concerned of its reasons for taking or not taking measures to redress the issue raised.   The investigation must be concluded within  12 months  and the proceedings within  20 months  of its launch. Both can be prolonged in justified cases.    Injury or risk of injury   The investigation of  injury  is based on evidence and takes into account the following factors:   the  situation of the EU air carriers concerned  , notably in terms of aspects such as frequency of services, utilisation of capacity, network effect, sales, market share, profits, return on capital, investment and employment;   the  general situation on the affected air-transport services markets  , notably in terms of level of fares or rates, capacity and frequency of air-transport services or use of the network.   A determination of a  threat of injury  is based on clear evidence and not merely on allegation, conjecture or remote possibility.   Redressive measures   If the investigation determines that a practice distorting competition adopted by a non-EU country or entity has caused injury to an EU air carrier, the Commission can impose redressive measures through  implementing acts  . These measures can be either:   financial duties;   any operational measure of equivalent or lesser value, such as the suspension of concessions  *  , of services owed or of other rights of the non-EU air carrier.   The Commission will not impose redressive measures if:   any of the 3 initial conditions is not fulfilled;   it is against the EU interest;   the non-EU country or entity has eliminated either the practice distorting competition or the injury or threat of injury to EU air carriers.    EU interest    A determination of the EU interest is made by the Commission on the basis of an appreciation of all the various interests, which are relevant to the situation;   priority is given to protecting consumer interests and maintaining a high level of connectivity for passengers and for the EU;   the need to eliminate the practice distorting competition, to restore effective and fair competition, and to avoid any distortion to the internal market is also taken into account.     The EU interest is determined on the basis of an economic analysis by the Commission.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 30 May 2019.   background     Air transport  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Injury:  in this context, injury to an air carrier could involve harm arising from unfair competition leading, for example, to a loss in market share.   Concession:  in this context, the right granted to an airline to fly a given route.
   A single railway network for Europe     A single railway network for Europe     SUMMARY OF:      Directive 2012/34/EU establishing a single European railway area      WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?      Directive 2012/34/EU      seeks to clarify the legal rules that apply to the EU’s rail sector so as to:      improve quality through stimulating competition;       strengthen market supervision; and       improve conditions for investment.      The directive merges and repeals the three directives from the ‘       first railway package      ’. These concern:      the development of the EU’s railways (Directive         2001/12/EC        );       the licensing of railway undertakings (Directive         2001/13/EC        ); and       the management of railway infrastructure (Directive         2001/14/EC        ).       Directive (EU)         2016/2370       amends Directive 2012/34/EU with regard to the opening of the market for       domestic passenger transport services      and the       governance of railway infrastructure      .     KEY POINTS      Increased quality through competition       Directive 2012/34/EU:       permits greater transparency as regards the conditions of access to the rail market;       improves the access for operators to rail-related services such as:          railway stations           freight terminals and           maintenance facilities.         Infrastructure managers       *       When infrastructure is operated by railway companies that have         historically had a dominant position        on the market, it must:          be             independent            in terms of organisation and decision-making; and           have             separate accounting systems            .         Subject to appropriate safeguards being in place to ensure the independence of the infrastructure manager as regards         essential functions         *        ,         traffic management        and         maintenance planning        , amending Directive (EU) 2016/2370 allows EU countries to choose between         different organisational models        . These models range from full structural separation to vertical integration.       Amending Directive (EU) 2016/2370 introduces         rules on loans, dividends to railway company owners        and         financial flows into vertically integrated undertakings        . These rules are designed to prevent the distortion of competition, in particular the         risk of cross-subsidisation        in integrated structures.       Domestic passenger services       Amending Directive (EU) 2016/2370      ensures that all railway companies have       equal access to tracks and stations      . However, EU countries may limit the right of access to passenger services between a given place of departure and a given place of destination when one or more public service contracts cover the same route. This is also the case when one or more public service contracts cover an alternative route, if exercising this right were to compromise the economic equilibrium of the contract or contracts in question.      Regulatory control        Directive 2012/34/EU        strengthens the         independence of national regulatory bodies that oversee the national rail market        . These bodies may impose fines in the case of inappropriate conduct or may carry out audits. Regulatory control is strengthened by means of         close cooperation        between the         regulatory bodies        and the         national authorities responsible for rail safety and licensing        .        Amending Directive (EU) 2016/2370        gives regulatory bodies the power to monitor:          traffic management           renewal planning and           scheduled and unscheduled maintenance works.         Rail financing      The competent public authorities must prepare       longer-term investment strategies      to offer more stability to the infrastructure manager, in taking investment decisions and in planning works, as well as more certainty to investors, in order to encourage companies to invest in modernising infrastructure. These strategies should cover a period of at least 5 years and should be renewable.      Adoption of         implementing        and         delegated        acts      The       European Commission      has adopted a series of       implementing acts      that supplement Directive 2012/34/EU and concern the following.      An         economic equilibrium test        to be exercised in the case of new rail passenger services (Implementing Regulation (EU) No         869/2014        ). From 12 December 2020, Regulation (EU) No 869/2014 will be repealed and replaced by Implementing Regulation (EU)         2018/1795        , which ensures that the same criteria and procedures apply to         all new rail passenger services        , regardless of whether they are domestic or international.       Criteria for applicants for         railway infrastructure capacity        (Implementing Regulation (EU)         2015/10        ).       Certain aspects of the procedure of         licensing railway undertakings        (Implementing Regulation (EU)         2015/171        ).       The modalities to be followed for         applying the charges of the cost of noise effects        (Implementing Regulation (EU)         2015/429        ).       The calculation of direct costs for         use of railway infrastructure        (Implementing Regulation (EU)         2015/909        ).       Reporting obligations of the EU countries regarding         rail market monitoring        (Implementing Regulation (EU)         2015/1100        ).       Procedures and criteria concerning framework agreements for the         allocation of railway infrastructure capacity        (Implementing Regulation (EU)         2016/545        ).       Access to         service facilities and rail-related services        (Implementing Regulation (EU)         2017/2177        ).      In 2017, the Commission adopted Delegated Decision (EU)       2017/2075      replacing Annex VII to Directive 2012/34/EU. This concerns the       schedule for the infrastructure capacity-allocation process      .      COVID-19 pandemic       Regulation (EU)         2020/698        introduces temporary flexibility concerning the renewal or extension of certain certificates, licences and authorisations and the postponement of certain periodic checks and periodic training in certain areas of EU transport legislation in order to help companies and authorities deal with the exceptional circumstances resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The regulation extends by 6 months the time limits for carrying out the regular review of licenses and the validity of temporary licenses as laid down in Directive 2012/34/EU. Its Article 13 also contains rules on the treatment of licences of railway undertakings in the event of non‐compliance with financial fitness requirements.       Regulation (EU)         2020/1429        lays down temporary rules on the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure so as to allow national authorities and infrastructure managers to deal more easily with a number of negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for as long as those consequences persist. It applies to the use of infrastructure for both domestic and international rail services covered by Directive 2012/34/EU for the reference period of 1 March 2020 until 31 December 2020. It allows infrastructure managers to reduce, waive or defer the minimum-access-package charges and the reservation charges. Due to the unforeseeable nature of the pandemic, the possibility exists for the Commission to extend the reference period during which the measures under the regulation apply.      FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?       Directive 2012/34/EU        has applied since 15 December 2012 and had to become law in the EU countries by 16 June 2015.       The application of many of the rules introduced by         amending Directive (EU) 2016/2370        will be phased in over a period between 1 January 2019 and 14 December 2020 (see Article 3(2) of the directive).

summary of   Decision 2013/255/CFSP — restrictive measures against Syria    Regulation (EU) No 36/2012 — restrictive measures in view of the situation in Syria   what is the aim of the decision and the regulation  They set out sanctions to be imposed on the Syrian regime and its supporters.   key points    Restrictions on trade in goods, services and technology   The sanctions include restrictions on trade with the EU in items which may be used directly or indirectly for the  internal repression  of the Syrian people. They include:   a ban on the import of  arms and related material  from Syria;   export restrictions on  certain equipment, goods and technology  that might be used for internal repression or for the manufacture or maintenance of such products;   a requirement for EU countries to  inspect vessels and aircraft  if there are reasonable grounds to believe they carry arms, related material or equipment which might be used for internal repression;   an export ban on equipment, technology or software primarily intended for  monitoring or interception of the internet or telephone communications  ;   a prohibition on  Syrian financial institutions  opening new branches or subsidiaries in the EU or to establish new joint ventures or new correspondent banking relationships with EU banks;   an import ban on  crude oil and petroleum products  from Syria;   a ban on investment in the  Syrian oil industry  ;   a ban on investment in companies engaged in the construction of  new power plants  for electricity production in Syria;   a ban on trade in goods belonging to Syria’s  cultural heritage  which have been illegally removed from Syria with the objective of facilitating the safe return of those goods;   a ban on trade in gold, precious metals and diamonds with Syrian public bodies and the central bank.    Asset freezing and travel bans   The sanctions also target individuals and companies responsible for the violent repression of the Syrian people, those supporting or benefiting the regime, along with persons and companies associated with them. In particular, the decision and regulation impose:   a freezing of the assets and travel bans on over 250 individuals and at least 70 entities. Funds or economic resources otherwise frozen may be released under certain conditions including:   to make payments on behalf of the Syrian Arab Republic to the  Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)  , for activities related to the OPCW verification mission and the destruction of Syrian chemical weapons;   for evacuations from Syria;   humanitarian purposes;     a freezing of the assets of the Syrian central bank within the EU with a ban on making funds or economic resources available, but an allowance for legitimate trade to continue under strict conditions.

   MEDIA Plus (2001-2006): programme to encourage the development, distribution and promotion of European works     MEDIA Plus (2001-2006): programme to encourage the development, distribution and promotion of European works     The aim of the MEDIA Plus programme is to support the European Union's audiovisual industry with a view to boosting the production and distribution of European audiovisual works. The underlying objective is to prevent the European market from being dominated by imported programmes, particularly from the USA.     There are two parts to the MEDIA programme: the first relates to the development, distribution and promotion of audiovisual works and the second to training. The text below refers to the former.     ACT     Council Decision       2000/821/EC      of 20 December 2000 on the implementation of a programme to encourage the development, distribution and promotion of European audiovisual works (MEDIA Plus - Development, Distribution and Promotion) (2001-2005) [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     The Media Plus programme follows on from the       MEDIA      (1991-1995) and       MEDIA II      (1996-2000) programmes.      Budget      . The MEDIA Plus - Development, Distribution and Promotion programme has a budget of 350 million euros for the period from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2005.      General objectives      . The programme's general objectives are: to improve the competitiveness of businesses in the European Union, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises; to support the transnational movement of European works and to promote linguistic and cultural diversity in Europe. It also promotes the enhancement of Europe's audiovisual heritage, the development of the audiovisual industry in regions with a low production capacity and/or a restricted geographical or linguistic area, and the use of new technologies.      Types of measures assisted      . Actions which receive support are transnational and involve different operators from the Member States participating in the programme.      Areas of action      . The programme supports actions to develop audiovisual content, actions in the distribution and dissemination sector, and promotion of and access to the market in audiovisual works. Pilot projects may also be carried out.      Development      . This involves helping independent companies and in particular small and medium-sized enterprises to carry out projects or packages of production projects for European and international markets. Assistance is also provided for the use of new information technologies.      Distribution and dissemination      . The following are encouraged: companies disseminating non-domestic European works to the public or for private use; the movement of European television programmes produced by independent companies; the creation of European works in digital format and support for linguistic diversity.      Promotion      . Assistance is given for the promotion of European works at trade shows, fairs and audiovisual festivals in Europe and throughout the world. The networking of European operators is encouraged by supporting joint activities in the European and international markets for promotion by private and public bodies. Actions supporting market access, the creation of databases and participation in festivals are promoted.      Pilot projects      . The aim of pilot projects is to improve access to European works by taking advantage of innovative technologies. Making greater use of archives, digitisation, networking of special-interest channels and advanced online services are encouraged.      Participants      . The programme is open to operators from the Member States of the EU and, according to the agreements in force with these countries, the associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe, Cyprus, Turkey, Malta, the members of the European Free Trade Association and the countries which have signed the European Convention on Transfrontier Television.      Funding      . Community support does not normally exceed 50% of the total cost of the actions. In some cases, particularly for projects which promote linguistic diversity within the European Union, Community support may be up to 60% of eligible expenditure.      Cooperation with the EIB: "i2i-Audiovisual" initiative      The "       i2i Audiovisual      " Initiative, which is financed by the European Investment Bank (EIB), is intended to supplement the MEDIA Plus programme in order to provide Europe's audiovisual industry with new financial and banking instruments. This should help to give the creators of audiovisual works a stronger financial base and to speed up the changeover to digital technologies. The measure is intended to fund some of the costs of the guarantees demanded by banks or financial institutions and/or part of the cost of a loan for financing their trade debts.     This initiative is an integral part of the "i2i" Initiative (for the "Innovation 2000" Initiative) set up in June 2000 by the EIB Group to help develop a European economy based on knowledge and innovation.     By Decision       846/2004/EC      , the programme was extended to run until 2006.

The       MEDIA 2007      programme follows on from the MEDIA Plus and MEDIA Training programmes of support for the European audiovisual sector. The new programme is conceived as a single programme combining the two existing parts (development, distribution, promotion / training). With a budget of EUR 755 million, it will cover the period 2007-2013.      Results and implementation       Commission report of 24 November 2003 on the implementation and mid-term results of the MEDIA Plus and MEDIA Training programmes (2001-2005) and on the results of the preparatory action "Growth and audiovisual: i2i audiovisual" [         COM(2003) 725        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      This report evaluates the first two years of implementation of the MEDIA Plus and MEDIA Training programmes. According to the report, initial results show that MEDIA Plus has achieved its objectives:       Development        : this strand has helped to make professionals more aware of the importance of the development phase and given them access to additional funding (MEDIA Plus support represents on average16% of development costs);        Distribution        : MEDIA Plus support in this area has produced satisfactory results in terms of the objectives which had been set: 90% of films distributed outside their national territory during the reference period received funding from MEDIA Plus;        Promotion and Festivals        : this strand has proved very effective for circulating non-national European works and disseminating them among the public. On average, 80% of European works were screened at the festivals which received funding, which gives this strand a high European added value;        Pilot projects        : the pilot projects were small in number (five) but accounted for a significant part of the budget (EUR 3.2 million);      "i2i Audiovisual" preparatory action: the period covered by the evaluation included only one selection exercise, during which 40 projects were selected, with total funding amounting to around one million euros.     The report also highlights the advantages linked to financial support at European level:      it gives a European dimension to the projects receiving assistance - this would not exist if the selection mechanisms used in the MEDIA programme did not emphasise this aspect;       it redresses the balance between the small countries, where national assistance is either non-existent or insignificant, and the large countries;       national aid and Community assistance complement one another, one example being the transnational dimension introduced by Community support, while national aid systems are still largely geared towards support for national production.

   The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia – Information society and media     The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia – Information society and media     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM (2011) 666      final – SEC(2011) 1203 – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was granted candidate country status for European Union (EU) membership in 2005. The Accession Partnership, adopted by the Council in 2008, supports the country’s preparations in view of its future membership and the alignment of its legislation with the Community       acquis      . In 2008, the accession negotiations had not yet been opened, as some progress still needed to be made on the objectives and conditions set out in the partnership.     The       2011 Report      notes progress with regard to the alignment of the legislation with the       acquis      , although the capacities of the Broadcasting Council to monitor the market remain inadequate.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission’s words)      The       acquis      includes specific rules relating to       electronic communications      ,       information society services      , particularly e-commerce and services based on conditional access, and to audiovisual services. In the field of electronic communications, the       acquis      aims at removing the obstacles preventing the smooth running of the internal market of telecommunications services and networks, at encouraging competition and at protecting consumers’ interests, specifically by guaranteeing the universal availability of modern services.     In terms of       audiovisual policy      , the       acquis      requires legislative alignment with the       Television without Frontiers Directive      which creates the conditions for the free movement of television programmes in the European Union. The       acquis      intends to define a transparent, reliable and efficient regulatory framework for public and private broadcasting which meets European standards. It also estimates the capacity for participating in the Community programmes Media Plus and Media Training.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      Progress was made in the field of       information society and media      . Alignment with the EU       acquis      is advancing and most of the key competitive safeguards were introduced. The capacity of the Broadcasting Council to monitor the market effectively remains inadequate.     RELATED ACTS      Commission Report [         COM(2010) 660        final – SEC(2010) 1327 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2010 Report presents advancements concerning alignment with the       acquis      and liberalisation of the Information Society and Media sector. In particular, progress must be made to ensure the proper functioning of public service broadcasters.      Commission Report [         COM(2009) 533        final – SEC(2009) 1334 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The October 2009 report indicates that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has progressed on audiovisual policy, having partly met its objectives. However, while the administrative capacity of the Broadcasting Council was strengthened, no efforts were made to ensure the sustainability of the public service broadcaster. Also, both still face political interference. In the field of culture, the country has made some progress and its preparations now meet the EU requirements.      Commission Report [         COM(2008) 674        final – SEC(2008) 2699 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The November 2008 report noted that some progress had been achieved in the field of audiovisual policy and that preparations in the media sector were advanced. However, certain concerns remained, in particular with regard to the financial situation of the Broadcasting Council and the public service broadcaster. In the area of culture, progress had been good. The country has been participating in the Community programme on culture.

summary of   Reflection paper (COM(2017) 358 final) on the future of EU finances   what is the aim of this reflection paper  The EU faces many important challenges such as immigration, internal and external security and defence, as well as trying to maintain its role on the world stage as a major donor of humanitarian and development aid and as a lead player in fighting climate change. To meet these challenges, it needs to consider its future financing and find ways to do as much as possible with each euro. These competing demands also need to be seen in the context of a budget that is going to be reduced following Brexit.  Mid-way through the current  multiannual financial framework  which runs until 2020, this  European Commission  reflection paper constitutes the last in a series of 5 papers on issues that are central to the debate launched on 1 March 2017 by the  White Paper on the future of Europe  .   key points    Structure   The paper comprises 5 chapters.    1.     Financing European integration:  the evolution of EU finances — this chapter traces the development of the  budget  over the years as the scope of the EU’s competences has broadened and the number of member countries has grown. It points out how the EU budget remains a small part of total public expenditure in the EU, accounting for less than 1% of EU income and only around 2% of EU public expenditure. This share has fallen over time, increasing the pressure on the EU budget to be more efficient, focus on areas where its impact is greatest and ensure that its rules do not get in the way of results.      2.     The added value of EU finances:  European added value is about achieving the objectives set out in the treaties but also about a budget that provides for public goods of a European dimension or helps uphold basic freedoms, the single market or the  economic and monetary union  . European added value also fits with the principles of  subsidiarity  and  proportionality  and EU action has to be additional or complementary to national or regional efforts, but should not be a substitute for shortcomings in national policies.      3.     Trends and challenges:  current trends that will remain relevant for some time include the digital revolution, globalisation, demographic change, economic convergence and  climate change  . At the same time, citizens are looking for prosperity, stability and security in a rapidly evolving world, and further unexpected challenges that emerge should not be excluded. This chapter looks at how EU spending matches its priorities and what room there might be for improvement.      4.    Options for future EU finances:  the design of the future budget must be underpinned by a clear vision of the EU’s priorities. To date, new priorities have been accommodated under the current financial framework by pushing existing flexibilities to their limits. This is not an option in the future. The size, structure and content of the budget have to correspond to the EU’s political ambition. The chapter looks at:   what the EU budget should be spent on;   how the budget should be financed;   how some key policies should be reformed; and   how the budget itself should be structured and organised.       5.    Possible scenarios for the EU-27:  this chapter mirrors — in budgetary terms — the five scenarios for the future model of the EU presented in the White Paper:   carrying on as at present;   doing less together — mainly focusing on the single market;   some EU countries doing more — a variant of the  ‘multi-speed’ Europe  ;   radical redesigning — with fewer policy fields but deeper and more efficient integration;   doing much more together.      background   The White Paper on the future of Europe and the accompanying reflection papers on key topics will now be debated by the EU institutions and in EU countries.

   Promoting creativity and innovation through education and training     Promoting creativity and innovation through education and training     Creativity and innovation are considered crucial tools for growth and sustainable development. Education and training are seen to contribute to the promotion of these capacities. Hence, further action is needed both at the national and EU level to incorporate creativity and innovation into lifelong learning.     ACT     Conclusions of the Council and of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States, meeting within the Council of 22 May 2008 on       promoting creativity and innovation through education and training      [Official Journal C 141 of 7.6.2008].     SUMMARY     The       ‘Education and Training 2010’ work programme      promotes the common European objectives of quality, access and openness to the wider world. Since creativity and innovation are also relevant for dealing with global challenges, they should be incorporated into the future framework of European cooperation in the education field. Education and training can develop creative and innovative capacities, which in turn contribute to sustainable economic and social development in Europe.     The       2006 Recommendation on key competences for lifelong learning      lists eight competences that contain skills relevant for creativity and innovation. Among them, the abilities to see change as an opportunity, to be open to new ideas and to respect others’ values are particularly important. Inclusive education policies that promote tolerance and understanding should be designed in order to turn multiculturalism into an asset for creativity, innovation and growth.     New research is needed to identify, measure and document learning outcomes, especially on soft skills like creative and innovative capacities. In addition, to promote these capacities, substantive data need to be presented to policy-makers. The contribution of the EU in this process must also be considered.     Consequently, the Member States are called upon to:      promote the incorporation of creativity and innovation at all levels of education and training;       support the professional development of teachers as mediators of creativity and innovation;       encourage the development of a learning culture where networks and partnerships between educational institutions and related bodies are forged with the corporate sector.      It is suggested that both the Member States and the Commission:      consider complementing the objectives of European cooperation in education with the promotion of creative and innovative capacity, and supporting the implementation of the 2006 Recommendation on key competencies for lifelong learning;       develop environments that favour creativity and innovation by promoting multi-level cooperation, intercultural dialogue and cultural production;       promote creativity and innovation in collaboration with appropriate international organisations, such as the Council of Europe, Unesco and the OECD;       promote the development, exchange and dissemination of good practice on evidence-based education policies relating to creative and innovative skills;       promote creativity and innovation at all stages of lifelong learning through the EU programmes and instruments.      Finally, the Commission is called upon to:      support relevant research, analysis and exchange of data on the promotion of creative and innovative capacity through education and training;       incorporate the development of creative and innovative capacity through education and training into the European education cooperation beyond 2010 and the broad-based European innovation policy.       Background      These conclusions build upon the outcomes of the Conference on Promoting Innovation and Creativity: Schools’ Response to the Challenges of Future Societies of 9-10 April 2008 and on the political background set out in the Annex to these conclusions. The latter includes notably the Council conclusions of 4 December 2006 on a Broad-based Innovation Strategy: Strategic Priorities for Innovation at EU level, which were based on the Commission Communication       COM(2006) 502      of 13 September 2006 on a European innovation strategy. These perceive education as one of the pre-conditions for innovation, indicating the importance of supporting the development of talent and creativity from an early age through education.

   Pressure equipment     Pressure equipment     The Directive aims to harmonise the provisions of Member States' national legislation concerning pressure equipment posing a pressure hazard. The Directive is based on the principles of the "New Approach to Technical Harmonisation and Standards". In line with this new approach, the design and manufacture of pressure equipment is subject to essential safety requirements.     ACT     Directive       97/23/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 May 1997 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning pressure equipment [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     This Directive aims to harmonise the national legislation of Member States concerning the design, manufacture, testing and conformity assessment of:      pressure equipment;       assemblies of pressure equipment constituting an integrated whole.      It seeks to ensure that the relevant equipment in the European Union (EU) and certain other associated countries, such as those in the European Economic Area (EEA), can be placed on the market freely.      Scope      The Directive's provisions apply to equipment subject to a maximum allowable pressure greater than 0.5 bar (i.e. 0.5 bar above atmospheric pressure) that poses a hazard due to pressure.     The Directive does not apply to:      equipment already regulated at EU level;       equipment posing a minor pressure hazard (category I) and covered by other "New Approach" directives;       equipment not posing any significant pressure hazard (e.g. radiators);       equipment that poses a significant pressure hazard but does not need to be covered by the Directive in respect of the free movement of goods and safety.       Market surveillance      All pressure equipment and assemblies within the scope of the Directive must be safe when placed on the market and put into service.     Member States must take steps to ensure that pressure equipment cannot be placed on the market if, when installed, maintained or used, it endangers the health and safety of persons, domestic animals or property.      Essential requirements      In accordance with the principles of the "       New Approach to Technical Harmonisation and Standards      ", the design and the manufacture of pressure equipment are subject to essential safety requirements.     This new approach means that Member States cannot prohibit, restrict or impede the placing on the market or putting into service of pressure equipment complying with the provisions of the Directive (       bearing the CE marking      ).      Harmonised standards      The       European Committee for Standardisation      (CEN) is producing a series of harmonised European standards. Equipment manufactured in accordance with these standards is presumed to conform to the essential safety requirements of the Directive.      Classification of pressure equipment      As some of the Directive's provisions are applied differently to different categories of pressure equipment, a classification system has been established. To determine in which category specific equipment is placed, it is necessary to identify:      the type of equipment: vessels, steam generators or piping;       the physical state of the relevant fluids: gaseous or liquid;       the group of fluids for which the equipment is intended: group 1 or group 2.      Group 1 comprises dangerous fluids, as defined in Directive       1967/548/EEC      on the classification, packaging and labelling of       dangerous substances      . Group 2 comprises all other fluids.     On the basis of this classification, five categories of pressure equipment can be identified according to the risk: sound engineering practice (SEP), I (the lowest risk category), II, III and IV (the highest risk category). Risk is measured according to the pressure and/or volume limits set out in the Directive.      Requirements for the different categories of pressure equipment      Pressure equipment in the SEP category:      must comply with sound engineering practice;       is not obliged to meet the essential requirements relating to design, manufacture and testing;       is not subject to conformity assessment;       cannot bear the CE marking. However, it must have adequate instructions for use and bear the identification of the manufacturer or his/her authorised representative established within the Community.      Sound engineering practice applies to equipment that is not subject to conformity assessment but must be designed and manufactured in accordance with sound engineering practice in a Member State in order to ensure its safe use.     Pressure equipment in categories I, II, III and IV must:      meet the essential requirements relating to design, manufacture and testing;       satisfy the conformity assessment procedures;       bear the CE marking and other information.       Conformity assessment and notified bodies      Before pressure equipment in categories I to IV can be placed on the market, the equipment's manufacturer must ensure that a procedure (module) is carried out to assess conformity with the essential requirements of the Directive. Different modules are provided for each category in which equipment is classified.     The participation of notified bodies appointed by Member States is required for the modules for category II, III and IV products. These bodies approve and monitor manufacturers' quality systems and test products directly.     As regards materials, pressure-equipment manufacturers must observe safety requirements by using materials that:      either comply with harmonised standards;       or are covered by a European Approval for Materials (a technical document issued by a notified body defining the characteristics of the materials used in the manufacture of pressure equipment not covered by a harmonised standard);       or have been the subject of a particular materials appraisal.

summary of   Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices   what is the aim of the regulation   It updates the rules on placing on the EU market, making available and putting into service  in vitro diagnostic (IVD) medical devices   *   for human use  and their accessories.   It also contains rules on the conduct of  performance studies   *  that are carried out in the EU concerning IVD medical devices (or accessories).   It aims to improve  patient safety  by introducing stricter procedures for  conformity assessment  (to ensure that unsafe or non-compliant devices do not end up on the market) and  post-market surveillance  .   key points    Scope   It covers IVD medical devices for human use and their accessories. However, devices manufactured and used in the same healthcare centre are exempted from the rules laid down by this regulation, other than the relevant general safety and performance requirements, so long as a number of conditions are fulfilled.   Classification system   The classification system for IVD medical devices has been adapted to the rapid scientific progress in the field and to the international guidance. They are classified according to their intended purpose and their inherent risks (classes A, B, C and D — for more details, see the regulation’s Annex VIII).   Notified bodies    The regulation tightens the rules concerning how the independent  notified bodies  — which assess the conformity of medium- and high-risk medical devices before they are placed on the market — are designated, organised and monitored.   These bodies have to meet the same high-quality standards throughout the EU and must have the required staff to successfully perform their conformity assessment tasks.   On-site inspections of manufacturers, of which some are unannounced, must be carried out.    Clinical data    The regulation specifies what is required in the data collection of performance studies on IVD medical devices. These have been aligned with those applicable for clinical trials on medicinal products. These include rules on informed consent and protecting vulnerable subjects (e.g. people under the age of 18, pregnant women or the incapacitated).   Performance studies conducted in more than one EU country will be subject to a  coordinated assessment  .    Manufacturers’ obligations    Manufacturers have clearer and more stringent obligations to monitor the quality, performance and safety of devices.   They are required to have measures in place that correspond to the level of risk, type of device and size of company. They must ensure they have sufficient financial coverage with respect to their potential liability under the  product liability directive  as well as  quality management and post-market surveillance systems  .   In the event of damages due to defective devices, a manufacturer’s authorised representative is jointly and severally liable.    Traceability   The regulation introduces a system for registering devices and manufacturers, importers and authorised representatives to ensure the traceability of devices throughout the supply chain by means of a  unique device identification system  . This will ensure that, should problems arise, measures can be taken rapidly.   High-risk devices   In the event of the  first certification for class D IVD devices  , and when common specifications are not available,  designated reference laboratories  will check the performance claimed by their manufacturers and an expert panel will be consulted on innovative devices of the same class. Although the notified body is not bound by the panel’s opinion, it has to provide a justification for not following it. Nevertheless, the notified body shall not deliver this first certificate if the scientific opinion of the EU reference laboratory is negative.   Genetic counselling   Patients tested with a genetic test must be provided with all relevant information on its nature, significance and implications. They must be given appropriate access to counselling in cases where a test provides information on the genetic predisposition for medical conditions and/or diseases which are generally considered to be untreatable.   Incident reporting   In addition to the obligation for manufacturers to report serious incidents (resulting in death or a serious deterioration in a person’s health) and trends in non-serious incidents (for example, side-effects from the use of a device), the regulation introduces the obligation for EU countries to encourage and enable healthcare professionals, users and patients to report suspected incidents at national level.   Market surveillance   Competent EU authorities are responsible for ensuring that any unsafe device is withdrawn from the market.   Eudamed   A centralised database, called the  European Databank on Medical Devices (Eudamed)  will be developed to provide EU countries, businesses, patients, healthcare professionals and the public with information on medical devices available in the EU.   Repeal of existing legislation — Directive 98/79/EC and Commission Decision 2010/227/EU   The regulation repeals Directive  98/79/EC  and  Decision 2010/227/EU  from 26 May 2022, with some exceptions laid down in Article 112.   from when does the regulation apply  It entered into force on 25 May 2017 and applies from 26 May 2022. Dates of application for some of the regulation’s articles vary and are detailed in Articles 110 and 113.   background   This regulation is one of 2 adopted by the EU to overhaul its laws on medical devices. The second regulation (  Regulation (EU) 2017/745  ) concerns medical devices.  For more information, see:    Medical devices  (  European Commission).    Following the COVID-19 outbreak and introducing measures to cope with the impact of the crisis, the European Commission adopted:    Communication from the Commission — Guidelines on COVID-19 in vitro diagnostic tests and their performance    key terms    In vitro diagnostic medical devices:  term covering a wide variety of devices used for providing information on:  (a) a physiological or pathological process or state;   (b) a congenital physical or mental impairment;   (c) the predisposition to a medical condition or disease;   (d) the safety and compatibility between the materials used and the specimens of the body intended to be used;   (e) treatment response or reactions;   (f) defining or monitoring therapeutic measures.   Examples range from self-tests for pregnancy through to tests for highly transmissible substances using specimens taken from the human body.    Performance studies:  studies that demonstrate that an IVD medical device complies with the necessary regulatory requirements through conformity assessment procedures.
   Road safety: appointment and vocational qualification of safety advisers     Road safety: appointment and vocational qualification of safety advisers     The purpose of this directive is to require undertakings involved in the carriage of dangerous goods to designate one or more safety advisers to be responsible for helping to prevent the type of risk inherent in this kind of transport operation.     ACT     Council Directive       96/35/EC      of 3 June 1996 on the appointment and vocational qualification of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail and inland waterway [Official Journal L 145 of 19.06.1996].     SUMMARY     Aim: To require Member States to ensure that undertakings the activities of which include the transport, or the related loading or unloading, of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway each appoint one or more safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods, responsible for helping to prevent the risks inherent in such activities with regard to persons, property and the environment.     Definition of terms: (undertakings, safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods, etc.).     Exemptions: The Directive does not apply to:      the carriage of goods under the authority of the armed forces;       activities concerning quantities within the limits defined in the Directive;       undertakings which only occasionally engage in the national transport of dangerous goods posing little danger or risk of pollution.      Role and appointment of adviser: The adviser has to seek all appropriate means and promote all appropriate action to ensure that dangerous goods are transported in the safest possible way.     Training certificate: the adviser must hold a vocational training certificate covering at least the subjects listed in Annex II to the Directive, the aim being to ensure that the candidate is sufficiently aware of the risks inherent in the transport of dangerous goods, knows the laws in question and has sufficient knowledge of the duties of the adviser defined in Annex I.     Validity of the certificate: five years, may be extended where, during the final year before its expiry, its holder has followed refresher courses or passed an examination both of which must be approved by the competent authority.     Accident report: In the event of an accident affecting persons, property or the environment, the adviser is required to draw up a report.     Adaptation of the Directive: The Directive sets up an advisory committee to assist the Commission by giving its opinion on the legislation in question.     Directive 96/35/EC will be repealed by Directive 2008/68/EC tr0006 as from 30 June 2009.      References            Act                 Dateof entry into force                 Final date for implementation in the Member States                Directive                 96/35/EC                09.07.1996               31.12.1999          RELATED ACTS      Directive       2000/18/EC       of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2000 on minimum examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway [Official Journal L 118 of 19.5.2000]      Directive       96/35/EC      lays down that undertakings whose activities include the transport of dangerous goods must appoint one or more safety advisers. However, that directive does not contain any detailed provisions aimed at the harmonisation of examination requirements for safety advisers or any provisions applicable to examination bodies. For this reason, Directive       2000/18/EC      establishes a common minimum framework for the examination of safety advisers and the conditions for the examination bodies in order to guarantee a certain level of quality and to facilitate the mutual recognition of EC certificates of training for safety advisers.     The national authorities organise a compulsory written examination which may be supplemented by an oral examination to check whether candidates possess the necessary level of knowledge required to carry out the tasks of adviser in order to obtain the EC certificate. This examination covers general prevention and safety measures, the classification of dangerous goods, general packaging requirements, danger markings and labels etc.     If Member States do not take direct charge of the organisation of the examination, they must appoint the examination bodies on the basis of various criteria such as: competence of the examination body, independence of the body etc.     Directive       2000/18/EC      entered into force on 19.5.2000. It will be repealed by Directive       2008/68/EC      as from 30 June 2008.     Last updated: 24.10.2008  
act   Directive  2009/125/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 establishing a framework for the setting of eco-design requirements for energy-related products   summary    what does the directive do  It establishes a framework for minimum eco-design requirements which goods that consume energy must meet before they can be used or sold in the EU. It does not apply to transport used to carry people or goods.   key points    Eco-design requirements cover all stages of a product’s life: from raw materials, manufacturing, packaging and distribution to installation, maintenance, use and end-of life.   For each phase, various environmental aspects are assessed by bodies designated by EU countries. They verify aspects such as the materials and energy consumed, expected emissions and waste and possibilities for reuse, recycling and recovery.   Manufacturers must construct an ecological profile* of their products and use this to consider alternative design possibilities.   Products which satisfy the requirements bear the CE marking and may be sold anywhere in the EU.    Directive 2012/27/EU  amended the 2009 legislation to further promote energy efficiency*. It requires national authorities to do the following.   Establish an indicative national energy efficiency target.   Approve a long-term strategy to renovate residential and commercial buildings.   Renovate, from 1 January 2014, 3 % of the total floor area of government-owned buildings.   Introduce energy efficiency obligation schemes to achieve an annual 1.5 % energy saving* by final customers between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2020.   Submit large enterprises to an independent energy audit from 2016.   Ensure customers are billed on their actual consumption at least once a year.   Inform the Commission, by 31 December 2015, of the potential for efficient co-generation* and district heating and cooling*.   See also:    energy-efficient products on the European Commission’s website  ;    eco-design and energy labelling on the European Commission’s website  .   key terms    *Eco-design  : the integration of environmental aspects into product design with the aim of improving the environmental performance of the product throughout its whole life cycle.   *Ecological profile  : a description of the inputs and outputs (such as materials, emissions and waste) associated with a product throughout its life cycle which are significant from the point of view of their environmental impact. These inputs and outputs are expressed in physical quantities that can be measured.   *Energy efficiency  : using less energy to provide the same service. Examples in terms of products are: energy-efficient fridges and washing machines.   *Energy saving  : reducing or going without a service to save energy. Example: turning off a light.   *Co-generation  : the simultaneous production of electricity and heat, both of which are used.   *District heating  : a heating network that enables energy, which is often wasted in power generation or industrial processes, to be harnessed and delivered to a point of use.   *District cooling  : the centralised production and distribution of cooling energy. The cold water pumped around the district cooling network is used to cool the air circulating in ventilation systems. The water is then fed back to the production plant to be cooled again.

   Customs 2013 (2008-2013)     Customs 2013 (2008-2013)     The customs administrations of European Union (EU) Member States play an important role in protecting the interests of the European Community (EC). They also ensure an equal level of protection throughout EC territory for citizens and economic operators within the Community. This Decision establishes the Community action programme Customs 2013 (2008-2013). The programme aims to support the development of a pan-European electronic customs environment which ensures that customs activities match the needs of the internal market, guarantees the protection of the financial interests of the EC and increases safety and security.     ACT     Decision No       624/2007/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 May 2007 establishing an action programme for customs in the Community (Customs 2013).     SUMMARY     The aim of the Customs 2013 programme is to help customs administrations in participating countries to facilitate legitimate trade and to simplify and speed up customs procedures. The programme will start on 1 January 2008 and end on 31 December 2013.      Objectives      The main objectives of the Customs 2013 programme are:      supporting the development of a pan-European electronic customs environment which ensures that customs activities match the needs of the internal market, guarantees the protection of the EC's financial interests and increases safety and security;       contributing to the creation of a modernised         customs code        ;       increasing cooperation between customs administrations so that they carry out their tasks as effectively as if they were a single administration;       increasing international customs cooperation between EU customs administrations and third countries customs authorities in the field of supply chain security;       preparing for enlargement, including the sharing of experience and knowledge with the customs administrations of the countries concerned;       developing cooperation and exchange of information and best practices with the customs administrations of third countries, in particular candidate countries, potential candidate countries and partner countries of the         European Neighbourhood Policy        ;       standardising and simplifying customs systems and controls to reduce the administrative burden and the cost of compliance for economic operators;       identifying, developing and applying best working practices.       Action      Customs 2013 will include activities in the field of communications systems and exchange of information, comparative analyses, seminars and workshops, project groups and steering groups, working visits, training activities and monitoring activities.      Participation in the Programme      The countries participating in the Customs 2013 programme are the EU Member States. The programme is also open to candidate countries benefiting from a pre-accession strategy, potential candidate countries (after the conclusion of framework agreements concerning their participation in Community programmes) and certain partner countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy (provided that a sufficient level of proximity has been attained and in compliance with relevant framework agreements).      Budgetary implications      The Customs 2013 programme will run for a period of six years, in accordance with the       Financial Perspectives 2007-13      . The amount to be borne by the Community budget is EUR 328.8 million.      BACKGROUND      Customs 2013 continues the activities carried out in the framework of the previous customs programmes, in particular       Customs 2007      , and supports the increasingly important development of       e-customs      .

Pending its proposal for the future Customs 2013 (2007-2013) programme, the Commission proposes extending the Customs 2007 programme. The Commission believes that the Customs programme contributes to the aim of sustainable economic growth. One of the objectives of the 2013 programme is to ensure the smooth flow of external trade, while applying effective controls on goods. As in previous programmes, activities are intended to contribute to the smooth functioning of the internal market and preparing and ensuring the common implementation of Community customs legislation. In addition, the new programme must respond to new challenges and changes currently taking place, for example with respect to       safety      (management of external borders and control of the whole international supply chain), the creation of an       electronic customs environment      and the       fight against counterfeiting and piracy      .      Decision No         253/2003/EC        of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 February 2003 adopting an action programme for customs in the Community (Customs 2007).      The Customs 2007 programme (2003-2007) is intended to support and complement operations undertaken by the Member States to safeguard the functioning of the internal market in the customs field. This Decision will be repealed with effect from 1 January 2008.     Last updated: 14.06.2007  
summary of   Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 — food additives   what is the aim of the regulation   It replaces previous European Union (EU) legislation by bringing all types of food additives  *  under one legal act.   It provides lists of:    approved additives  ;   conditions on their  use  and  labelling  .     It also simplifies the authorisation procedure.   key points    Only  EU-approved  additives may be sold and used in food.   To be approved, a food additive must not pose any  health risks  or  mislead consumers  . It must meet a  reasonable need  that cannot be achieved in any other way.   An additive must provide  benefits for consumers  . These include:   preserving food’s nutritional quality;   helping in its manufacture, processing, preparation, treatment, packing, transport or storage;   meeting special dietary needs.     Specific conditions apply to  sweeteners  and  colourings  .   Additives should be used at the lowest level needed to achieve the desired effect. This level must take account of an  acceptable daily intake  and the needs of  special groups  of consumers (e.g. people with allergies).   Additives should not, as a rule, be used in:    unprocessed foods  ;   foods for  infants  and  young children  .     Additives, whether for sale to the final consumer or not, must meet  clear labelling requirements  , such as providing the name and/or E-number (for instance, sunset yellow colouring is E 110).   The legislation does not apply to the following substances, unless they are used as food additives:    processing aids  , i.e. a substance used to process raw materials;   substances used to  protect plants  and  plant products  ;    nutrients  and added to food;    water treatment  substances.     from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 20 January 2010.   background   Most evaluations of additives date back to the 1980s and 1990s. They are now being re-evaluated. This process should be completed by 2020.  After that, the  European Commission  may propose changes to the current usage conditions, or remove some additives from the approved list.  For more information, see:    Food additives  on the European Commission website;    Food additives  on the European Food Safety Authority website.   * key terms     Food additives:  substances used in foods for different reasons, e.g. to sweeten them, provide colour or prolong shelf life.
   Sustainable Consumption, Production and Industry Action Plan     Sustainable Consumption, Production and Industry Action Plan     The Commission proposes a number of measures to support the implementation, in the European Union and internationally, of a policy to promote environmentally friendly consumption and production.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 25 June 2008 on the ‘Sustainable Consumption and Production and Sustainable Industrial Policy Action Plan’ [       COM(2008) 397 final      – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The Commission proposes the implementation of a series of measures to improve the energy and environmental performance of products throughout their life cycle, and to stimulate demand and consumption of better quality products, thus creating a ‘virtuous circle’.     These targets may be reached by:      extending the scope of the Directive on         ecodesign        , which for the moment only applies to energy-using products, to all energy-related products or those products which have an impact on energy consumption during their use (window frames, water-using devices etc.);       extending the scope of the         Energy Labelling        Directive to cover a wider range of products;       revising the         Ecolabel        Regulation to simplify and streamline the process of obtaining an ecolabel, and to extend the product coverage;       promoting         green public procurement        , by providing guidance and tools for public authorities to "green" their procurement practices;       implementing incentive measures aimed at reducing the environmental footprint of the retail sector and its supply chain, promote more sustainable products, and better inform consumers.       Leaner production      There is already a regulatory framework for production processes concerning       environmental emissions from industries      and the       greenhouse gas emission allowance trading scheme      , in particular. The Commission considers however that there is a need to give further impetus to environmentally friendly production processes and energy savings. In this context, the Commission intends to act in three areas:      increase efficient use of resources (creating more value while using less resources);       support eco-innovation;       enhance the environmental potential of industry, by revising the         EMAS        Regulation (Community eco-management and audit scheme), by preparing industrial policies for environmental industries and by helping small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to fully exploit business opportunities in the field of environment and energy.       Acting on a global scale      Action will also be undertaken at a global level:      promote good practice internationally in sustainable production and consumption;       promote international trade in environmentally friendly goods and services;       promote sector-based agreements in international negotiations on climate change.       Context      The action plan forms part of the European Union Strategy for       Sustainable Development      and the       Community Lisbon Programme for 2008-2010      of which one of the main orientations is the promotion of an industrial policy geared towards more sustainable consumption and production. The Commission will review progress and report on the implementation of the initiatives proposed in 2012.     Last updated: 22.09.2008  
summary of   Directive 2000/31/EC – electronic commerce in the EU   summary    what does the directive do  It establishes  standard rules  in the EU on various issues related to electronic commerce.   key points   Online services covered by the Directive include:        —     news services (such as news websites)            —     selling (books, financial services, travel services, etc.)            —     advertising            —     professional services (lawyers, doctors, estate agents)            —     entertainment services            —     basic intermediary services (internet access, transmission and hosting of information)            —     free services funded by advertising, sponsorship, etc.      The Directive establishes the principle that operators of these services are subject to regulation (related to the taking up and pursuit of the services) only in the EU country where they have their  registered headquarters  – not in the country where the servers, email addresses or postboxes they use are located.  National governments must ensure that operators  publish basic information  on their activities (name, address, trade register number etc.) in a permanent and easily accessible form.   Advertising   National governments must ensure that advertising follows certain rules:        —     it is clearly identifiable as advertising            —     the person or company responsible for it is clearly identifiable            —     promotional offers, games or competitions are clearly identifiable, and the conditions are easily accessible and presented in clear and simple terms.       Spam   Unrequested e-mail (‘spam’) must also be clearly identifiable. Companies who send out spam emails must regularly consult and respect ‘opt-out registers’, to which people who do not wish to receive such emails can sign up.   Online contracts   In every EU country, electronic contracts must be given  equivalent legal status  to paper contracts.  These contracts must also spell out the following, in  clear and understandable  terms:        —     the technical steps consumers must follow to conclude the contract            —     whether or not the contract will be filed by the service provider and whether consumers can view it at a later stage            —     how consumers can identify and correct typing errors before placing their order            —     the languages in which the contract can be signed.      Consumers must be able to  save  and  print out  contracts and general conditions.  See also  Directive 2011/83/EU  on consumer rights.   Online orders   These are bound by the following requirements:        —     the service provider must confirm receipt of the order without undue delay and electronically (email, other electronic message)            —     the order (or receipt confirmation) is considered to have been received when the seller (consumer) is able to access it.      See also  Regulation (EU) 910/2014  on electronic identification and trust services.   Enforcing existing legislation   The Directive encourages both self-regulation by operators and co-regulatory efforts with governments. Examples include :        —     codes of conduct at EU level            —     online systems for settling disputes out of court, especially when the seller and buyer are in different countries.      EU countries must also provide fast, efficient solutions to legal problems in the online environment and ensure penalties are effective, proportionate and dissuasive.   Liability of service providers   Online service providers who act as mere conduit, caching or hosting services providers are not responsible for the  information they transmit or host  if they fulfil certain conditions. In the case of hosting service providers, they are exempted from liability as long as:        —     they do not have actual knowledge of illegal activity or information and,            —     if they obtain such knowledge or awareness, they act at once to remove or to disable access to the information      National governments cannot impose any general monitoring obligation on these ‘intermediaries’ over the information they send or store, to look for and prevent illegal activity.   background    E-commerce directive   act   Directive  2000/31/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market (‘Directive on electronic commerce’)   REFERENCES           Act     Entry into force     Deadline for transposition in the Member States     Official Journal       Directive  2000/31/EC      17.7.2000     16.1.2002      OJ L 178, 17.7.2000, pp. 1–16
   Iceland - Economic and Monetary Policy     Iceland - Economic and Monetary Policy     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM(2011) 666      final – SEC(2011) 1202 final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The       2011 Report      highlights that the country’s level of alignment with the European Union (EU)       acquis      remains incomplete on economic and monetary policy.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        - (according to the Commission’s words)      EU legislation on economic and monetary policy contains specific rules requiring the independence of central banks in Member States, prohibiting direct financing of the public sector by the Central Bank and prohibiting privileged access of the public sector to financial institutions. Upon accession, new Member States will be expected to coordinate their economic policies and will be subject to the provisions of the       Stability and Growth Pact      on budget monitoring matters. These States are also committed to complying with the criteria laid down in the Treaty in order to be able to adopt the euro. Until their adoption of the euro, they will participate in       Economic and Monetary Union      as a Member State with derogation and will treat their exchange rates as a matter of common concern.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      Some progress has been achieved by Iceland in the field of       economic policy      ; however additional effort is required to improve its coordination with the EU’s policies. No new development has been noted in the field of       monetary policy      , the field in which alignment must be completed, particularly concerning the independence of the Central Bank and the prohibition of monetary financing of the public sector.     The country achieved a good level of alignment concerning the       financial and budgetary rules      . The country continued to identify the fields which still need to be aligned. Preparations connected with administrative capacity and for setting up the own resources system must be completed. A coordination structure needs to be formally established.

   Civil aviation rules and the EASA     Civil aviation rules and the EASA     SUMMARY OF:      Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Union Aviation Safety Agency      WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?     It aims to establish a high and uniform level of civil aviation safety while ensuring environmental protection.     It updates aviation safety law and includes:      a revised mandate for the         European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)        ;       new rules designed to allow the EU aviation sector to grow, make it more competitive and encourage innovation.      KEY POINTS     The regulation covers       all key areas of aviation      including:      airworthiness;       aircrews;       aerodromes;       air operations; and       air navigation services.      The regulation:      includes rules for unmanned aircraft (civil drones);       aims to facilitate simpler rules for sport and recreational aviation;       sets out a division of tasks between the EU and national authorities;       repeals three previous regulations (Regulations (EC) No         552/2004        and (EC) No         216/2008        of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Regulation (EEC) No         3922/91        );       amends two directives (Directives         2014/30/EU        on         reducing interference between electrical and electronic devices        and         2014/53/EU        on the         commercialisation of radio equipment        ) and four regulations ((EC) No         2111/2005        on the establishment of a list of         banned air carriers and on the identity        of the operating carrier, (EC) No         1008/2008        on the         operation of air services        , (EU) No         996/2010        on         civil aviation accidents and incidents        , (EU) No         376/2014        on         occurrences in civil aviation        ); and       complements Regulations (EU) No         1321/2014        on         airworthiness        and (EU) No         748/2012        on         environmental certification        .       Main changes and additions       The regulation updates EU safety legislation in the aviation sector. Essential requirements are established for aircraft with respect to their airworthiness and environmental compatibility. Manufacturers will be required to issue         certificates of airworthiness        , in accordance with the technical requirements.       It introduces         risk- and performance-based rules        which set objectives but leave some flexibility as to the means for achieving them. It also promotes taking non-binding measures (such as safety promotion actions) whenever this is possible.       It         revises the scope        of some rules, by excluding small, single occupancy hot-air balloons, adjusting the weight limits for sailplanes, and adding light electric aircraft. It introduces reforms to:          deal with the growth of air traffic;           increase security;           reduce costs, delays and the impact of air traffic on the environment.          Cabin crew        involved in commercial air transport are subject to certification and should be issued with an attestation. The         European Commission        has established detailed rules and procedures for the qualification of cabin crew members. The regulation also sets out essential requirements for safe         ground handling services        , which are now included within the scope of the regulation, and closes a number of other safety gaps.       A new chapter on         aviation safety management        is introduced, establishing the         European Aviation Safety Programme        , covering the whole aviation safety system.       Civil drones       The regulation introduces essential requirements for drones. The rules are meant to be proportionate to the risk of the particular operation or type of operation and state that the drone must be safely controllable and manoeuvrable. It should be designed to fit its function and intended type of operation, and take into account privacy and protection of personal data by design and by default. Identification of the drone and of the nature and purpose of the operation should also be possible.       The drone operator should be responsible for its operation and should have knowledge and skills proportionate to operating the drone safely. Organisations involved in drone design, production, maintenance, operations, related services and training, must establish a safety occurrence reporting system.       The regulation specifies the         registration threshold        that applies to drone operators: operators must be registered if they operate drones which can transfer more than         80 Joules of kinetic energy        upon impact with a person. This threshold can be amended in the future without lengthy procedures to take account of developments in this area.       Depending on the nature and risk of the activity, the operational characteristics of the aircraft and the characteristics of area of operation, a         certificate        may be required for design, production, maintenance and operation as well as for personnel, including remote pilots.       In accordance with the regulation, the Commission, with the help of EASA, drew up Regulation (EU)         2019/947        which lays down         detailed rules for drones        and for         drones’ operation        . Regulation (EU)         2020/746        amends Regulation (EU) 2019/947, postponing the dates of application of certain measures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.       Pilot licences issued by non-EU countries      Regulation (EU)       2020/723      lays down the detailed rules for the conditions for the acceptance of pilot licences and associated ratings, privileges or certificates, as well as associated medical certificates issued in accordance with laws of non-EU countries.      European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)       The regulation extends EASA’s scope to safety-related aspects of security, such as         cybersecurity        , and to         environmental protection        .       It establishes a mechanism for the pooling and sharing of aviation inspectors, and other technical assistance to support EU countries in certification, oversight and enforcement tasks.       The         electronic information repository        established by the Agency to ensure effective cooperation between the Agency and the national competent authorities includes information on the reallocation by one EU country to another or to the Agency of responsibilities related to certification, oversight and enforcement, as well as measures concerning flights above conflict zones.      FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?     It has applied since 11 September 2018.

   Balanced participation of women and men in the decision-making process     Balanced participation of women and men in the decision-making process     The European Union defines measures aimed at promoting the participation of women in the decision-making process in both the public and the private sectors.     ACT     Council Recommendation of 2 December 1996 on the balanced participation of women and men in the decision-making process.     SUMMARY     The Council recommends that the Member States adopt a comprehensive, integrated strategy designed to promote the balanced participation of women and men in the decision-making process, and to develop or introduce to this end the appropriate legislative, regulatory or incentive measures.     The Council recommends that the Member States:      alert all those involved in education and training to the importance of an image of women's role in society which is free of prejudice and discriminatory stereotypes, a more balanced sharing of professional, domestic and social responsibilities between women and men and more balanced participation of women and men in the decision-making process;       encourage girls and women to take part and express themselves in education and training activities as actively and fully as boys and men;       encourage and support efforts of associations and organisations to promote women's access to the decision-making process;       encourage and support the efforts of the social partners to promote balanced participation of women and men in their activities;       devise, launch and promote public campaigns to alert public opinion to the usefulness and advantages for society as a whole of balanced participation by women and men in decision-making.      The Council recommends that the Member States:      promote or improve the collection and publication of statistics to provide a picture of how women and men are represented at all levels of the decision-making process;       support, develop and encourage quantitative and qualitative studies on the legal, social or cultural obstacles impeding access to the decision-making process for persons of either sex;       support and encourage initiatives creating examples of good practice in the various areas of the decision-making process.      The Council recommends that the Member States:      promote more balanced participation by women and men at all levels in government;       provide for, implement or develop a coherent set of measures encouraging equal opportunities in the public sector;       encourage the private sector to increase the presence of women at all levels of decision-making, notably by the adoption of equality plans and positive action programmes.      The Council calls on the Commission:      to encourage and organise, within the framework of the medium-term Community action programme on equal opportunities for men and women (1996-2000), systematic pooling of experience and assessment of the policies pursued in order to achieve a better balance between women and men in the decision-making process;       to step up its efforts to provide information, alert public opinion, encourage research and promote schemes aimed at achieving balanced participation by women and men in the decision-making process;       within three years from adoption of this Recommendation, to submit a report to the Council on its implementation, on the basis of information provided by the Member States.

Despite various efforts and results in the different Member States and the European institutions, there has been no significant change to the situation of women being under-represented in decision-making posts. While the European institutions have given special attention to recruitment and promotion policies, the gender balance has not been met either in the committees or in bodies at all levels in the Member States.     The balanced participation of women and men in the decision-making process is an essential requirement of democracy and a positive step for society, as decisions then take into account the needs and interests of the population as a whole.     The Commission recommends the adoption of a long-term global strategy and highlights the need to raise awareness in the private sector, a sector which requires particular attention and perhaps a different approach. Data collection also needs to be improved in order to ensure regular monitoring. Finally, a new measure should be agreed upon.

summary of   Directive 2003/96/EC — restructuring the EU’s system for the taxation of energy products and electricity   what is the aim of the directive   It lays down European Union (EU) rules on taxes in regard to electricity, all motor fuels and most heating fuels.   The purpose is to ensure that the EU’s single market for energy operates smoothly and to avoid any distortions of trade and competition which could result from big differences in national tax systems.   The rules contribute to wider goals such as moving to a competitive, low-carbon, energy-efficient economy.   key points    Energy products are taxed only when used as motor fuel or for heating.   The legislation introduces minimum levels of tax on motor fuels, heating fuels and electricity applicable from 1 January 2004.   Energy products used for heating, in agriculture, stationary motors and machinery for construction and public works can be taxed at lower levels than fuel for cars.   Governments may apply a lower rate of duty on commercial diesel (when used by road hauliers or for passenger transport) than on diesel for non-commercial use.   The directive allows tax exemptions and reductions in particular for environmental and health policy reasons. Governments may exempt from taxation  renewable energy sources  such as biofuels or fuels and electricity used to transport goods and passengers by train, metro, tram or trolleybus.   The legislation allows for reduced taxes for energy-intensive firms — those that have made the greatest effort to reduce consumption. EU countries which had difficulty implementing the new measures were given transitional arrangements before applying the legislation (Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria and Portugal).   Similar temporary exemptions and transitional periods were granted to the countries that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007.   The legislation does not apply to some energy-intensive sectors (e.g. in metallurgy) or to energy products which have a dual use, i.e. they are used both for heating and for another purpose (e.g. for the production of certain chemicals).   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 31 October 2003. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 31 December 2003.   background   For more information, see:    ‘Excise Duties: Current Energy Tax Rules’  on the European Commission's website.
   Community action in the field of mental health     Community action in the field of mental health     Mental health problems have a social, economic and structural impact on the welfare of the population as a whole. It is therefore necessary to provide information on mental health, promote its importance and pre-empt mental disorders through appropriate measures at Community level and in the Member States.     ACT     Council conclusions of 3 June 2005 on a Community action in the field of mental health [Not published in the Official Journal]     SUMMARY     These conclusions are a follow-up to the Ministerial Conference of the World Health Organisation (WHO) on mental health, entitled "Facing the Challenges, Building Solutions", held in Helsinki from 12 to 15 January 2005.     They are based on a series of measures linked directly or indirectly with mental health, including the following:      the Council resolution of 18 November 1999 on the         promotion of mental health        ;       the Council conclusions of 15 November 2001 on         combating stress- and depression-related problems        ;       the Council conclusions of 2 June 2003 on         combating stigma and discrimination in relation to mental health        ;       the         programme of Community action in the field of public health (2003-2008)        , the aim of which is to help to ensure a high level of human health protection and remedy inequalities in the fields of health and mental health;       the Council conclusions of 5 June 2001 on a Community strategy to reduce alcohol-related harm and those of 2 June 2004 on         alcohol and young people        .       Priority activities      The Ministerial Conference of the World Health Organisation (WHO) on mental health highlighted the need to implement, at Member State level, a       plan of action      in the area of mental health, focusing on improving the well-being and functioning of the people affected.     The Council underlines the need to accord greater importance to the social, economic and structural impact of mental health. To do this, synergies should be nurtured between the plan of action and the results of projects funded under the current and future Community programmes in the field of public health.     The general public's awareness of the importance of mental health issues and of the need to frame specific policies in this area should also be raised.     The Commission should be presenting, in the summer of 2005, a Green Paper on mental health, which will put forward information, promotion and prevention measures in this area.      Actions at Member State level      The Council calls on the Member States to:      focus on implementing the declaration and the plan of action adopted by the European Ministerial Conference of the WHO on mental health, while planning to devise appropriate measures over the long term;       take measures to collect reliable data on mental health and on the economic and social consequences of mental disorders;       adopt measures to implement holistic, integrated and effective mental health systems covering promotion, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, care and social reintegration;       continue the development of monitoring and evaluation tools that facilitate comparisons of the status of mental health between the Member States and of promotion and prevention practices;       make the best possible use of the relevant funding instruments, such as the Structural Funds and the         PHARE programme        , in order to meet specific needs in the area of mental health.       Actions at Commission level      The Commission is called upon to:      support the implementation of the declaration and the plan of action adopted by the European Ministerial Conference of the World Health Organisation on mental health;       ensure that the impact analysis of relevant future Community legislation takes mental health aspects on board;       emphasise the close links between mental health and physical health, as well as the links between mental disorders and drug and alcohol abuse;       pay special attention to people at vulnerable stages of life (children, young people and older people, in particular).      RELATED ACTS      Commission Green Paper of 14 October 2005 "Improving the mental health of the population. Towards a strategy on mental health for the European Union" [         COM(2005) 484        final - Not published in the Official Journal]      With this Green Paper, the Commission is launching a wide debate on mental health. The idea is to hold a public consultation on how to improve the management of mental illness and promote mental well-being in the European Union. The Green Paper proposes three main action areas at EU level:     1. Creating a dialogue with Member States on mental health     2. Launching an EU platform on mental health     3. Building up mental health information resources at EU level.      Conclusions of the "Employment, social policy, health and consumer affairs" Council of 2 and 3 June 2003 on combating stigma and discrimination in relation to mental health.      In these conclusions, the Council stresses the impact of the       stigma surrounding and the discrimination associated with mental illness      . The Council therefore calls for concrete actions to be taken in order to improve social inclusion and combat stigma and discrimination.      Council conclusions of 15 November 2001 on combating stress- and depression-related problems [Official Journal C 6 of 09.01.2002]      In these conclusions, the Council calls for the implementation of actions to prevent       stress and depression-related problems      and to promote mental health.

   DG ECHO: Annual Report 2006     DG ECHO: Annual Report 2006     This report outlines the principal activities of the EC's Directorate-General for Humanitarian Aid (DG ECHO) in 2006. The year was marked by the crisis in Lebanon, the earthquake in Indonesia, drought in many African states and Afghanistan, and a worsening of the humanitarian situation in certain existing crises.     ACT     Report from the Commission of 29 September 2006 - Directorate-General for Humanitarian Aid (DG ECHO): Annual Report 2006 [       COM(2006) 555      final - Not yet published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY      Main interventions      In 2006 DG ECHO allocated a total budget of 671 million, the main recipients being African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states, followed by Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, the Middle East and the New Independent States.     The most important actions in the ACP countries took place in Sudan (worsening of the Darfur crisis), Northern Uganda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Liberia. In the Mediterranean and the Middle East, DG ECHO provided assistance to victims of the war between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon and continued to help Palestinian refugees in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon as well as the most vulnerable populations in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. In Asia, DG ECHO's activity focused primarily on the Thai-Burma border (Burmese refugees) and on providing assistance to Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran. In Latin America, DG ECHO again provided assistance to populations affected by the violence in Colombia.     As always, DG ECHO continued to pay particular attention to forgotten crises       *      , using a method of analysis based on both quantitative and qualitative factors. The forgotten crises identified in 2006 were Algeria (Western Sahara), Myanmar, Nepal, Chechnya and India (Kashmir).     With regard to disaster preparedness activities, DG ECHO reinforced its institutional resources to facilitate mainstreaming disaster preparedness in humanitarian relief and rehabilitation programmes. It also allocated 10 million for pastoralist populations in the Horn of Africa (Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan and Uganda), to help them prepare for drought.     DG ECHO also continued to support programmes to reinforce the institutional capacities of the main international humanitarian agencies, e.g. the refugee registration programme operated by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).     To implement its operations, DG ECHO relied on some 200 partners in the field, most of them NGOs (54%), UN agencies (32%) and other international organisations (11%).     Financial Perspectives 2000-2006 - Financial Perspectives for 2007-2013     The report found that over the period 2000-2006:      the humanitarian aid budget was kept a quite stable and minimal amount, which meant that DG ECHO had to seek reinforcement every year, mainly through use of the Emergency Aid Reserve;       the funds allocated to the different regions varied sharply from year to year, reflecting the short-term orientation of DG ECHO's interventions;       the relative share of funds allocated to the ACP States increased over the period, and by 2006 accounted for nearly half the DG's total budget, the sole exception being in 2005, when Asia received the lion's share of funding, on account of the tsunami and the earthquake in Kashmir.      For the period 2007-2013, the integration of food aid and aid to uprooted people will enable DG ECHO to manage all humanitarian activities through a single instrument. In the context of linkage between relief, rehabilitation and development (LRRD), this will facilitate the transition from food aid to food security.      Other activities      The report underlines the significant change in the international humanitarian situation. On the one hand, the extent and number of natural disasters have increased, and conflicts last longer and are more destructive. On the other hand, there are new actors on the humanitarian aid stage, including non-traditional donors (companies and States) and the civil protection services and armed forces of the Member States. In this context, the EC launched a consultation between its partners and the Member States to strengthen the effectiveness and coordination of EU policies in the field of humanitarian aid. The results of this process fed into a Communication defining a European Consensus on the principles and best practice of humanitarian action.     In 2006 DG ECHO refined its methodology for assessing global humanitarian needs, splitting the GNA into vulnerability and crisis indicators for the 140 developing countries considered, on the basis of factors such as human development, malnutrition and natural disaster risk.     As regards its strategy for reinforcing the EU's response capacity in the event of disasters and crises in third countries, DG ECHO increased the number of experts in the field and further improved its operational and contractual procedures.     DG ECHO also continued to pursue its communication and information strategy and to develop its security and safety policy for staff engaged in the delivery of humanitarian aid.       Key terms used in the act         Forgotten crises: Crises that receive little or no media attention and whose victims receive relatively little or no international assistance.         Key figures given in the act         Total aid allocated in 2006: 671 million.         Main aid recipients: ACP countries (322 million / 48%), Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, the Middle East and the New Independent States (177.9 million / 27%), Latin America and Asia (105.5 million / 16%).

summary of   Directive 96/16/EC — statistical surveys of milk and milk products   what is the aim of this directive  It lays down EU-wide rules for the collection of statistics on milk  *  and milk products. It is designed to enable shorter and medium-term monitoring of the EU’s market for milk and milk products — this requires reliable, timely information on production and use of raw milk and of its components (including milk delivery for treatment or processing and the subsequent production of milk products).  It repeals previous legislation (Directive  72/280/EEC  ) which had been amended on a number of occasions.   key points   EU countries are responsible for  data gathering  and  organising the surveys  . The surveys cover the agricultural holdings producing milk and 2 groups of businesses:    1.    businesses and agricultural holdings which  purchase whole milk  (or, in certain cases, milk products) from agricultural holdings or from the second group (below) with a view to  transforming them into milk products  ;      2.    businesses which  collect milk and cream but do not process them  , and then  transfer  them to the first group (above) for transformation.     Depending on the information to be collected, EU countries must carry out the surveys on a  monthly, an annual or a triennial basis  . The directive sets out the  deadlines  by which EU countries should send the results of the various surveys to the European Commission (  Eurostat  ).  In 1997, the  European Commission  adopted Decision  97/80/EC  laying down rules for implementing Directive 96/16/EC. The  list of milk products  covered by Directive 96/16/EC is set out in Annex I to Decision 97/80/EC. This annex also provides  definitions  for each of the products.  Annex II to the decision provides  specimens of the tables  to be used for transmitting the data to Eurostat.  Annex III contains the  questionnaire  on the compilation of milk statistics.  The surveys must be  exhaustive  in the case of dairies accounting for at least 95% of the cows’ milk collected by each EU country, with the balance being estimated on the basis of  representative samples or other sources  . EU countries are responsible for ensuring comprehensive and sufficiently accurate results.  Each year, EU countries must send a  report  to Eurostat including their questionnaire and accompanied by their methodology for transposing data to the tables sent to Eurostat. An expert group  reviews  the operation of the directive annually.   from when does the directive apply  The directive has applied since 1 January 1997. It had to become law in the EU countries by 1 January 1997.   key terms    Milk:  milk of cows, ewes, goats and buffaloes.
summary of   Article 314 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)   what is the aim of article 314 of the tfeu   It lays down the procedures for the drawing up and adoption of the EU’s annual  budget  .   key points    EU institutions and bodies forward their  budget estimates  for the following year no later than 1 July to the  European Commission  In practice, the Commission seeks to have its draft budget ready in spring (April/May).   Based on these estimates, the Commission draws up the  draft budget  for the following year. It must forward this draft budget to the  Council  and the  European Parliament  by 1 September.   The Council must reach its  position  on the draft budget by 1 October. It forwards its position and the reasons for it to the European Parliament.   The European Parliament must adopt its  amendments  to the Council’s position within 6 weeks (42 days).   The Council has 10 days to accept the Parliament’s amendments. If it does not, a  conciliation committee  is formed comprising equal numbers of representatives of the Council and members of the European Parliament. This committee must agree on a  joint text  within 3 weeks (21 days).   If the conciliation committee cannot agree on a joint text, the Commission must present a  new draft budget  .   Once  agreement is reached  in the conciliation committee, the Council and the Parliament must approve or reject the text within 2 weeks (14 days).   If the Council rejects the joint text, Parliament may still adopt it but only if a majority of its members vote and three fifths of them support it.   If  both institutions reject  the joint text, the Commission must prepare a new draft budget.   If the budget is not agreed by the end of the year, a system known as ‘  provisional twelfths  ’ comes into play (  Article 315  of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union). This means that the equivalent of no more than one twelfth of the previous year’s budget or of the Commission’s draft budget — whichever is the smaller — can be spent each month until the budget is definitively adopted.   As new developments arise, the budget may need to be amended. The procedure for adopting  amending budgets  is the same as that for the annual budget.   background   For more information, see:    ‘Budget’  on the European Commission’s website   EU budget  glossary
   More effective extradition procedures: European arrest warrant     More effective extradition procedures: European arrest warrant     SUMMARY OF:      Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between EU countries      WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE FRAMEWORK DECISION?     It improves and simplifies judicial procedures to speed up the return of people from another       European Union      (EU) country who have committed a serious crime.     KEY POINTS     The European arrest warrant (EAW)       replaces the extradition system      . It requires each national judicial authority to recognise and act on, with a minimum of formalities and within a set deadline, requests made by the judicial authority of another EU country. A warrant asks for a person to be handed over so that:      a criminal prosecution can be conducted;       the person can be placed in custody or detention.      The warrant       applies      in the following cases:      offences punishable by imprisonment or a detention order for a maximum period of at least 1 year;       where a final custodial sentence has been passed or a detention order has been made, for sentences of at least 4 months.       Proportionate use of the warrant      EU countries must take the following into consideration (non-exhaustive list):      the circumstances and the gravity of the offence;       the likely sentence;       less coercive alternative measures.      When an individual is arrested, he/she must be informed of the contents of the arrest warrant.      In which cases must EU countries refuse to act on a warrant?       If an EU country has already handed down a final judgment on the person concerned for the same offence.       If the offence is covered by an amnesty in the EU country asked to hand over the perpetrator.       If the person concerned may not be held criminally responsible by the EU country asked to act on the warrant, owing to his/her age.       Rules to ensure procedural rights in arrest-warrant proceedings      These include:      Directive         2010/64/EU        on the         right to translation and interpretation in criminal proceedings        ;       Directive         2012/13/EU        on the         right of subjects to be informed of their rights        ;       Directive         2013/48/EU        on the         right to have access to a lawyer and the right of persons in custody to communicate        with family members and employers;       Directive (EU)         2016/1919        on         legal aid        for suspects and accused persons in criminal proceedings and for requested persons in EAW proceedings.       Room for improvement      The       European Commission      adopted its       first report on EAW      in 2011. It found that although the European arrest warrant was very successful in helping EU countries fight crime, several areas could be improved further, including:      transposition;       correct application;       proportionality;       ensuring procedural rights.      The Commission adopted the       4th Implementation Report on the EAW      in July 2020.     FROM WHEN DOES THE FRAMEWORK DECISION APPLY?     It has applied since 7 August 2002 and EU countries must take the necessary measures to comply with this Framework Decision by 31 December 2003.

   Drug precursors: internal aspects     Drug precursors: internal aspects     With this regulation, the European Union (EU) harmonises measures on the control and monitoring of substances that are frequently used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances. In this manner, it aims at preventing the diversion of these substances.     ACT     Regulation (EC) No       273/2004      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 February 2004 on drug precursors [       See amending act(s)      ].     SUMMARY     Effective control of chemicals used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances is an important tool in combating drug trafficking. However, these chemicals (known as “precursors”) also have legal and legitimate industrial uses. Therefore, it is necessary to recognise and protect the legal trade in these substances, while discouraging their diversion for illicit purposes.     The objective is to strike a balance between taking action to prevent the manufacture of illegal drugs and avoiding barriers to the legal trade in chemicals.      Measures to control precursors      This regulation establishes harmonised measures for controlling and monitoring within the European Union (EU) certain chemical substances that are frequently used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs. It defines “scheduled substances”       *      in accordance with Article 12 of the United Nations (UN) Convention (see below). For these scheduled substances, the regulation contains provisions relating to licences, customer declarations and labelling. A monitoring procedure is put in place to prevent obstacles to the free trade in these substances between EU countries.     At the same time, the regulation also defines “non-scheduled substances”       *      in accordance with Article 12 of the UN Convention. For these substances, the Commission draws up guidelines establishing a more flexible control system than the one applicable to scheduled substances.     Under the regulation, operators       *      must immediately notify the competent authorities of any circumstances, such as unusual orders or transactions involving scheduled substances to be placed on the market       *      , which suggest that such substances might be diverted for the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances.      Obligations of operators      Operators wishing to place on the market substances scheduled as precursors (categories 1 or 2 of Annex I) have the following obligations:      to appoint an officer responsible for the trade, and to notify the competent authorities of the name and contact details of that officer;       to declare the addresses of the premises at which they manufacture or from which they trade in these substances (for category 2);       to obtain a licence from the competent authorities for possession of substances listed in category 1 (special licences may be granted to pharmacies, dispensaries of veterinary medicine, certain types of public authorities or armed forces);       to ask customers to sign a declaration specifying the use(s) made of the substance provided to them;       to supply scheduled substances only to natural or legal persons in possession of a licence for possession of such substances (for category 1);       to affix a label to scheduled substances before they are transported, showing the name, quantity and weight of the substance and the name and address of the supplier and the recipient.      To prevent creating unnecessary barriers to trade, the requirements for scheduled substances in category 2 are less restrictive than for those in category 1, particularly where the quantities involved do not exceed those indicated in Annex II.     Assisted by a committee, the Commission draws up and keeps updated a list of substances to monitor. EU countries must distribute these lists to operators.     This regulation repeals Council Directive       92/109/EEC      , Commission Directives       93/46/EEC      ,       2001/8/EC      and       2003/101/EC      , and Commission Regulations (EC) Nos       1485/96      and       1533/2000      .      Background: internal and external aspects of the fight against drugs      In 1990, the UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances was adopted by the EU through Council Decision       90/611/ EEC      . Article 12 of the UN Convention required measures to be taken to monitor the manufacture and distribution of precursors. As regards the external aspect of this requirement, i.e. monitoring the trade in precursors between EU and non-EU countries, the requirements of Article 12 have been met by       Council Regulation (EEC) No 111/2005      .       Key terms used in the act         Scheduled substance: any substance listed in Annex I liable to be used for the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, including mixtures and natural products containing such substances. This excludes medicinal products, pharmaceutical preparations, mixtures, natural products and other preparations containing scheduled substances that are compounded in such a way that they cannot be easily used or extracted by readily applicable or economically viable means.         Non-scheduled substance: any substance which, although not listed in Annex I, is identified as having been used for the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances.         Placing on the market: any supply, whether in return for payment or free of charge, of scheduled substances in the EU; or the storage, manufacture, production, processing, trade, distribution or brokering of these substances for the purpose of supply in the EU.

This report evaluates the implementation as well as the functioning of Regulations (EC) Nos 273/2004 (above) and 111/2005.     Based on data received form EU countries, the Commission’s evaluation concludes that the legal framework for controlling trade generally provides measures that are proportionate for preventing the diversion of drug precursors without obstructing their legitimate trade. The well-functioning cooperation between operators and competent authorities has greatly contributed to this. Furthermore, the EU guidelines for the chemical industry, together with a new eLearning course for economic operators, complements well this legal framework.     EU countries have applied the common licensing system for category 1 precursors satisfactorily and it functions effectively for the competent authorities as well as for the industry. However, the registration requirement for category 2 precursors might have certain weak points for properly controlling, and preventing diversion in the trade of these substances. In addition, certain provisions (e.g. relating to customer declarations or criteria for determining mixtures) are interpreted differently by EU countries. Other difficulties concern the insufficient rate of reporting by operators to competent authorities and certain aspects of the legislation on external trade, such as inflexible time limits for pre-export notifications and lack of simplified authorisation procedures.     Consequently, the report makes the following recommendations:      enhance the harmonised application of the legislative framework by EU countries, especially by sharing best practice;       improve reporting, for example by increasing the frequency with which operators must report to competent authorities;       possibly modify existing legislation to strengthen controls on category 2 precursors;       strengthen controls on pharmaceutical preparations/medicinal products containing ephedrine or pseudo-ephedrine that transit through the EU;       modify the procedural requirements to achieve a level of controls that is proportionate to the risk of diversion.

   Integration Fund (2007-13)     Integration Fund (2007-13)     This decision establishes a European Integration Fund (EIF) of €825 million for the period 2007-13 as part of the general programme “Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows”.     ACT     Council Decision       2007/435/EC      of 25 June 2007 establishing the European Fund for the Integration of third-country nationals for the period 2007 to 2013 as part of the General programme “Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows”.     SUMMARY     This decision sets out the objectives of the European Fund for the Integration of non-European Union (EU) country nationals (EIF) and the rules for its management. It also establishes the available financial resources for the fund and the criteria for their allocation.      Eligible actions      The EIF finances national, transnational and EU level actions that are intended to facilitate the integration of non-EU country nationals in the host countries, targeting recent arrivals in particular. National actions are implemented by the EU countries within the framework of multiannual programming consistent with the EU’s strategic guidelines for the intervention of the fund (shared management). The budget allocated for EU level actions is implemented by the Commission (direct management).     The EIF supports national actions that:      facilitate the development and implementation of appropriate admission procedures designed to support the integration process;       support the development and implementation of the integration process, particularly in relation to non-EU country nationals recently arrived in the host country;       enhance the capacity of EU countries to develop, implement, follow up and evaluate policies for the integration of non-EU country nationals;       support the exchanges of information and good practices in and between EU countries by developing, implementing and assessing policies and measures for the integration of non-EU country nationals.      The EIF supports transnational and EU level actions that:      set up pilot projects and cooperation networks founded on transnational partnerships with a view to promoting exchanges of information and good practices;       organise transnational information and awareness-raising campaigns;       concern the publication of comparative studies and joint pilot projects;       assist the development of statistical tools, methods and indicators designed to measure the level of development of integration policies.      The Commission adopts a programme determining the priorities for each year and publishes calls for proposals for transnational projects.      Principles governing the fund’s actions      In line with the priorities and objectives laid down by the EU, the EIF provides grants to support actions of a non-profit nature already co-financed by public or private sources. Support from the fund may not exceed 50% of the cost of national actions. Exceptionally, this may be increased to 75% for projects addressing specific priorities identified in the strategic guidelines. The EU contribution is increased to 75% in EU countries covered by the       Cohesion Fund      .     The Commission adopts strategic guidelines for the period 2007-13, defining EU level priorities for each of the objectives of the fund.     The Commission approves EU countries' multiannual programmes that set out on the basis of the Commission’s strategic guidelines a strategy for and a description of the actions designed to achieve their objectives, as well as additional indications regarding project financing. It also adopts annual financing decisions approving each annual programme implementing the multiannual programme.      Committee, review and repeal      The Commission is assisted by the Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows Committee.     This decision must be reviewed by the European Parliament and the Council by 30 June 2013.      Background      This decision carries forward the recommendations of the       Hague Programme      and furthers the Commission communication of 1 September 2005 on a       common integration programme      and pilot projects and preparatory actions in the field of integration (INTI programme). With resources totalling €825 million for the period 2007-13, the fund is part of the       general programme “Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows”      , established by the Commission communication of 6 April 2005.

This decision establishes rules for EU countries’ application of actions under the EIF. It contains provisions on designated authorities and the delegation of tasks to these authorities. The decision also provides for the drawing up of a manual by EU countries that sets out the procedures and practical arrangements for the designated authorities’ application of the fund. In addition, the decision lists the information EU countries must submit to the Commission on the use of the fund, in particular as regards the description of their management and control systems, and when reporting irregularities. For the first, information must also be submitted by electronic means if possible. To this end, the Commission will develop a computer system. Finally, the decision also lays down rules on the information to be provided to beneficiaries as well as on the publicity for the general public regarding the fund.     Last updated: 10.08.2010  
act   Regulation (EU) No  606/2013  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 June 2013 on mutual recognition of protection measures in civil matters (OJ L 181 of 29.6.2013)   summary   This EU regulation establishes rules for a simple and rapid mechanism for the  recognition of protection measures in civil matters  ordered in EU countries.  The aim is to ensure that, without going through time-consuming procedures, victims of (for example domestic) violence or persons whose physical and/or psychological integrity or liberty is at risk and who benefit from a protection measure taken in one EU country benefit from  the same level of protection  in other EU countries should they move or travel.  A protection measure in one EU country is designed to  protect victims of violence  (for example domestic violence, stalking or violence against children) if that person’s physical and/or psychological integrity or liberty is at risk.  Protection measures are issued by a judicial or other authority upon request of the person at risk. Many of them are ordered without the person causing the risk being summoned to appear, in particular in case of urgency procedures.  More people are moving or travelling abroad. It is therefore extremely important to ensure that such  temporary protection  provided in one EU country is  maintained  when a person travels or moves to another EU country without having to go through time-consuming procedures.  A  standardised multilingual certificate  is designed to speed up the process by ensuring that the EU country to which the person at risk has gone to will recognise the protection measure issued by the first EU country  without any intermediate formalities  .  The certificate contains all information relevant for  recognition  and, where applicable,  enforcement  of the protection measure. The way it is designed to work is as follows:   the competent authority of the first country issues the certificate to the protected person and brings it to the notice of the person causing the risk (a translation of this certificate may also be provided upon request by the protected person);   the protected person provides the certificate and a copy of the protection measure to the competent authorities of the second country which then ensures its enforcement by adjusting the factual elements of the protection measure, if needed.

   Turkey – Health and consumers     Turkey – Health and consumers     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM(2011) 666      final – SEC(2011) 1201 – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The       2011 Report      signals progress both in public health and consumer protection matters. However, the country must complete its alignment with European legislation and develop its administrative capacities.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission’s words)      The       acquis      in this area covers protection of the       economic interests of consumers      in a number of specific sectors (misleading and comparative advertising, price indication, consumer credit, unfair contract terms, distance and doorstep selling, package travel, timeshare, injunctions for the protection of consumers' interests, certain aspects of the sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees), as well as       general safety of consumer goods      (liability for defective products, dangerous imitations and general safety of goods) and distance marketing of consumer financial services. The Member States of the European Union (EU) must transpose the       acquis      into their national law, and establish administrative structures and independent implementation bodies which ensure real market surveillance and effective application of the       acquis      . They must also provide appropriate judicial and out-of-court dispute resolution mechanisms. Furthermore, they must ensure that consumers are informed and educated and that consumer organisations play an active role. This chapter also covers certain binding rules with regard to       public health      .      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      Some progress can be reported on consumer and health protection.     In the area of       consumer protection      , revised framework laws for consumer protection and general product safety are still to be adopted. Improvement of market surveillance activities requires the allocation of further financial and human resources, while cooperation with consumer NGOs needs strengthening.     In the area of       public health      , Turkey has not yet completed the legislative alignment process nor built up the administrative capacity to improve the enforcement of legislation in order to enhance the health and safety status of the population.     RELATED ACTS      Commission Report [         COM(2010) 660        final – SEC(2010) 1327 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2010 Report stated that preparations in the fields of consumer protection and public health were on the right track. However, in terms of consumer protection, additional effort was required to strengthen consumer organisations and to ensure that legislation is implemented effectively. In the field of public health, the Report noted significant progress in terms of alignment with the       acquis      . However, implementation of the legislation still needed to be improved.      Commission Report [         COM(2009) 533        final – SEC(2009) 1334 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2009 Report did not present any significant progress but the Commission announced preparations in view of the continuation of the reforms.      Commission Report [         COM(2008) 674        final – SEC(2008) 2699 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2008 Report emphasised the good level of consumer protection offered by Turkey. However, the administrative capacity and cooperation of the market surveillance authorities should be developed. In addition, the share of the budget allocated to market surveillance was not adapted to the size of the country. The Commission also noted with regret the weak influence of the consumer associations.      Commission Report [         COM(2007) 663        final – SEC(2007) 1436 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2007 Report presented the progress made by Turkey. It also noted the lack of influence on the part of the consumer movement in Turkey.      Commission Report [         COM(2006) 649        final – SEC(2006) 1390 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2006 Report noted that Turkey had still to comply with European standards for the notification of dangerous products and the exchange of information on such products. Nevertheless, the Report mentioned improvements in the protection of consumers’ economic interests, such as the transposal of the Community Directive on credit cards.      Commission Report [         COM(2005) 561        final – SEC(2005) 1426 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2005 Report described progress in implementing non-safety-related measures, but no progress had been made in the area of safety. The increase in administrative capacity had not yet taken effect.      Commission Report [         COM(2004) 656        final - SEC(2004) 1201 - Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2004 Report noted that Turkey had made progress in implementing the       acquis      with regard to non-safety-related measures. It should therefore continue its efforts to transpose and implement the       acquis      with regard to liability for defective products.      Commission Report [         COM(2003) 676        final – SEC(2003) 1212 - Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2003 Report confirmed that Turkey had made good progress, but needed to continue its efforts to transpose and apply the       acquis      .      Commission Report [         COM(2002) 700        final - SEC(2002) 1412 - Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2002 Report recommended concentrating on bringing the legal framework into line with the       acquis      and on effectively implementing the measures already transposed.      Commission Report [         COM(2001) 700        final - SEC(2001) 1756 - Not published in the Official Journal].       Commission Report [         COM(2000) 713        final - Not published in the Official Journal].       Commission Report [         COM(1999) 513        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      The 1999 Report noted that the alignment of Turkish legislation with the Community       acquis      was continuing to progress slowly. Improvements were expected particularly in institutional terms.      Commission Report [         COM(1998) 711        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      In its 1998 Report the Commission noted that the framework Consumer Protection Act adopted in September 1995 had led to major improvements in legislative harmonisation in this field.

act   Council Directive  86/298/EC  on rear-mounted roll-over protection structures for narrow-track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors [  See amending acts  ].   summary   The directive applies to tractors having the following characteristics:   a maximum ground clearance of 600 millimetres;   a minimum track of the axle fitted with the widest tyres of less than 1 150 millimetres;   an unladen weight of more than 600 kilogrammes.   Each Member State will component type approve all types of roll over protective structure, together with their attachment to the tractor if this meets the design and testing requirements set out in the annexes to the directive. An EC component approval mark is then issued to it.  Member States may not prohibit the placing on the market of a tractor, nor reject EC or national approval if it meets the requirements of the directive.  The competent authorities in the Member States shall keep each other informed of any action that they take in order to ensure that protective structures conform to the type that has been component type approved. They may go as far as to withdraw an EC component type approval where there is serious, repeated failure to conform.  The directive will be amended in order to take account of technical progress.  Directive 86/298/EC is repealed by Regulation (EU) No  167/2013  with effect from 1 January 2016.

act   Directive  2004/17/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on the coordination of the procedures for awarding public procurement in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors.   summary   Directive 2004/17/EC on the special sectors of water, energy, transport and postal services (so-called special sectors) applies to the procurement issued by a contracting entity in the sectors in question for:   supplies;   services;   works.   However, it does not apply to works concessions or services regulated by Directive  2014/23/EU  .   Contracting entities   The special sectors directive applies to:   every contracting authority or public company which practises in the energy (gas, electricity, fossil fuel extraction), water, transport (including the provision of transport to ports or airports) and postal services sectors;   every contracting entity which practises in one (or several) of the above sectors and benefits from the special or exclusive rights granted by a competent authority of a Member State.   The annexes of the directive contain inexhaustible lists of the contracting entities.   Activities concerned   The directive particularly applies to the provision or operation of fixed networks intended to provide a service to the public in the following sectors:   production, transport or distribution of gas, heat, electricity or drinkable water. It also applies to the supplying of these networks with gas, heat, electricity, drinkable water, as well as contracts linked to the supply or treatment of water used for hydraulic engineering projects, irrigation or drainage;   transport by railway, automated systems, tramway, trolley bus, bus (under certain conditions) or cable.   It also applies to:   the provision of postal services;   the exploitation of a geographical area for the purpose of prospecting or extracting fossil fuels, or providing airports, ports or other terminals of transport with fossil fuels for use on carriers by air, sea or inland waterways.   It is important to note that the contracts awarded in the sectors in question  are no longer subject to the directive if there exists an effective competition approved by  a decision made by the Commission on the effective competition in a Member State or for a given sector   .     Thresholds revised every 2 years   The directive applies to public contracts that have an estimated value, excluding VAT, equal to or superior to the following thresholds:   €414 000 in the case of supply and service contracts;   €5 186 000 in the case of works contracts.    Criteria for the awarding of contracts   The criteria on which the contracting entities are based are:   either the lowest price;   or, where the award is offered to the most economically advantageous, various criteria linked to the contracted object, including: the quality, the price, the technical value, the environmental characteristics, etc.    Obligation of publication and transparency   This obligation is particularly targeted at the publication of information notices according to the standard formulas of the Commission, accessible on the  information system for European public procurement  (SIMAP). There are several types:   the notice announcing the publication of a periodic notice (not compulsory);   the periodic indicative notice (which can be used as a way to call for competition);   the contract or competition notice (compulsory when the way of calling for competition is neither a periodic notice, nor a notice on the existence of a qualification system);   the contract award notice or the result of a competition notice (compulsory);   the existence of a qualification system notice (which can be used as a way to call for competition).   For every contract, the contracting entity must also be in a position to justify its decisions and conserve all appropriate information for at least 4 years. At the earliest opportunity, it shall inform:   any unsuccessful applicant of the reasons for their rejection;   any applicant to which the offer is open, the advantages of the successful applicant as well as the name of the chosen economic operator.    Technical specifications   The technical specifications shall define the characteristics required of a material, supply or service such that they fulfil the use for which they are intended. They shall figure in the contract documentation (contract notice, specification or additional documents) and must not create unjustifiable obstacles for competition.   Conditions for participation   The European legislation on public procurement provides the conditions which can be demanded of participation in public procurement. These conditions aim to ascertain the economic operators’ aptitude for participation in a contract, on the basis of criteria relating to the economic and financial capacity and professional and technical capacities.  The conditions of participation also aim to combat fraud and corruption. Any economic operator condemned for having participated in a criminal organisation, corruption, fraud, or money laundering is systematically excluded from an award of public procurement by a contracting authority.  An economic operator can also be excluded from the participation in a public procurement if it:   is in a state (or object of a declaration) of bankruptcy, liquidation, cessation or suspension of activities or judicial settlement;   is found guilty of an offence concerning its professional conduct;   has committed an act of grave professional misconduct;   has not fulfilled regulations relating to the payment of social security contributions and taxes.    Procedures for the awarding of public procurement   There are different procedures for the award of public procurement:    the open procedure  ; all economic operators interested may present an offer;    the restricted procedure  ; all economic operators may demand to participate and only those who are invited may present an offer;    the negotiated procedure  : the contracting entities consult the economic operators of their choice and negotiate the procurement conditions with them.   The contracting entities may also award procurement  without prior call for competition  in certain specific cases listed in the Directive.   Competitions in the services sector   The directive applies to competitions for the procurement of services superior to €414 000.

summary of   Decision 94/156/EC on the accession of the Community to the Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area (1974 Helsinki Convention)    Decision 94/157/EC on the conclusion, on behalf of the Community, of the Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area (Helsinki Convention as revised in 1992)    Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area, 1992 (Helsinki Convention revised in 1992)   what is the aim of the decisions and of the convention   The decisions enabled the European Community (now the European Union - EU) to accede to the  Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area (Helsinki Convention)  .   The convention, which was signed in March 1974 by all the states bordering the Baltic Sea (Denmark, Germany, Sweden, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Russia), aims to reduce pollution of the Baltic Sea area caused by discharges through rivers, estuaries, outfalls and pipelines, dumping and shipping operations as well as through airborne pollutants.   key points    The Convention set up a  Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission (HELCOM)  to   monitor the implementation of the convention,   make recommendations for the protection of the marine environment,   decide on the budget and   assume such other functions as may be appropriate under the terms of the convention.     In addition, ministerial level meetings are held every few years.   The Helsinki Commission meets annually, with the Heads of Delegation representing the contracting parties.   The Helsinki Commission adopted in 2007 a  Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP)  , which is a programme to restore the good environmental status of the Baltic marine environment by 2021. The BSAP was updated in 2013, during the 2013 HELCOM Ministerial Meeting.   The BSAP is the basis for the work of HELCOM and focuses on the following priorities:   eutrophication (when there is an excess of nutrients in the water that fuels the growth of algae),   hazardous substances,   biodiversity and nature conservation, and   maritime activities.     Each priority is accompanied by a number of actions and measures.   One of the main tools developed by HELCOM is the  Nutrient Reduction Scheme  . It is a regional approach to sharing the burden of nutrient reduction  *  to achieve the goal of the Baltic Sea unaffected by eutrophication agreed by the Baltic Sea countries. The Scheme has been introduced and agreed first in 2007, in the HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan. At that time, the countries agreed on provisional nutrient reduction targets. HELCOM adopted the revised nutrient reduction scheme in 2013.   HELCOM has also been pursuing other actions in the context of the BSAP:   prevention of pollution from agriculture,   ensuring ecological sustainability of Baltic fisheries by 2021,   addressing land-based sources of pollution (waste water, pharmaceuticals, industrial releases, marine litter, etc.),   ensuring regionally coherent Maritime Spatial Planning processes in the Baltic Sea,   monitoring and assessing the marine environment,   cooperating on pollution preparedness and response,   protecting the Baltic biodiversity (red lists of species and habitats, marine protected areas, developing indicators), and   contributing to the regional implementation of the  International Maritime Organisation (IMO)  regulations on shipping.     In 2016, HELCOM contributed to the designation of the Baltic Sea, under the IMO, as a  Nitrogen Oxide Emissions Control Area (NOx ECA)  .   Lastly, HELCOM is also used as the regional cooperation structure for the implementation of  Directive 2008/56/EC  which established an approach for EU action in the field of marine environmental policy, for Baltic member countries.   from when do the decisions and the convention apply   The decisions have applied since 21 February 1994.   The original convention entered into force in 1980 and was amended in 1992. The 1992 amendments entered into force on 17 January 2000, after the ratification instruments were deposited by all of the contracting parties.   background   For more information, see:    ‘The HELCOM Convention’  on the European Commission's website.    ‘The HELCOM Convention’  on the Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission's website.   * key terms    Nutrient reduction:  in the case of the Baltic Sea, the levels of air- and water-borne nitrogen and phosphorus compounds arising from a combination of a high population density, agriculture, energy and transport.   main documents   Council Decision  94/156/EC  of 21 February 1994 on the accession of the Community to the Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area 1974 (Helsinki Convention) (OJ L 73, 16.3.1994, p. 1)  Council Decision  94/157/EC  of 21 February 1994 on the conclusion, on behalf of the Community, of the Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area (Helsinki Convention as revised in 1992) (OJ L 73, 16.3.1994, p. 19)   Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area  , 1992 (OJ L 73, 16.3.1994, pp. 20-45)
summary of   Communication (COM(2017) 673 final) — Strengthening European Identity through Education and Culture   what is the aim of this communication  The  European Commission  contributed  ideas to the EU Leaders’  meeting at the  Social Summit  in November 2017, in Gothenburg, to stimulate discussion on the future of education and culture. As part of the ongoing debate on the  Future of Europe  , the Commission sets out its vision of  a European Education Area by 2025  , building on initiatives such as:   the  New Skills Agenda for Europe  ,    Investing in Europe’s youth  ,    Improving and Modernising Education  ,    School development and excellent teaching for a great start in life  and    A renewed EU agenda for higher education initiatives  .   It is in the interest of all EU countries to make use of the full potential of education and culture to drive job creation, social fairness, active citizenship and economic growth as well as a means to experience European identity in all its diversity.   key points   The Commission calls for an ambitious European agenda on education and culture to address challenges facing the EU such as:   digitalisation,   increasing inequalities,   an ageing workforce   and the needs to enhance:   skills and competences,   critical thinking and media literacy,   in particular to address ‘fake’ news and counter populism and xenophobia.  It proposes to work jointly with the EU countries towards a European Education Area based on trust, mutual recognition, cooperation and the sharing of best practices, mobility and growth.   The European Education Area — 3 main strands:    boosting  mobility  across borders;   investing in  people  and their  education  ;   strengthening people’s sense of  European identity and awareness of cultural heritage  .    Essential features   The proposed steps towards a European Education Area include the following:    making mobility a reality for all  : expanding participation in the  Erasmus+  programme and the  European Solidarity Corps,  expanding participation in them, and creating  an EU Student Card  to allow a new user-friendly way of storing academic records;   initiating  a new process  , building on the  Bologna process  , to prepare the ground for the  mutual recognition  of higher education and school diplomas;    greater cooperation on curricula development  : ensuring education systems impart the knowledge and skills essential in today's world;    improving language learning  : aiming to ensure that by 2025 all young Europeans finishing secondary education have a good knowledge of two languages besides their native one;    promoting lifelong learning  : raising the share of people engaging in lifelong learning to 25% by 2025;    mainstreaming innovation and digital skills in education  : promoting innovative and digital training and preparing  a new digital education action plan  ;    supporting teachers  : allowing more teachers to participate in the Erasmus+ programme and the  eTwinning  platform and offering policy guidance on their professional development;    creating a network  to enable world-class European universities to work together across borders and establishing  a school of European and transnational governance  ;    investing in education  : using the  European Semester  to support structural reforms to improve education policy through EU funding instruments, and setting a benchmark for investment in education to  5% of GDP  ;    preserving cultural heritage and fostering a sense of European identity and culture  : developing — using the momentum of the  2018 European Year of Cultural Heritage  —  a European Agenda for Culture  and preparing  a Council Recommendation  on common values, inclusive education and the European dimension of teaching;    strengthening the European dimension of  Euronews   so as to have a channel offering independent, high-quality information with a pan-European perspective.   background   For more information, see:    The European Commission's contribution to the Leaders' meeting in Gothenburg, 17 November 2017  — Factsheets (  European Commission  )    Education and Training Monitor 2017  (  European Commission  ).
   Employment policy guidelines (2005-2008)     Employment policy guidelines (2005-2008)     In eight guidelines for higher employment in the European Union (EU), the Commission focuses on policies designed to achieve full employment, for example by improving inclusion of people at a disadvantage, greater investment in human resources, adaptation of education and training systems and more flexibility combined with job security.     ACT     Council Decision       2005/600/EC      of 12 July 2005 on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States.     SUMMARY     The integrated guidelines for growth and jobs for the period 2005-2008 bring together, in a single, coherent and simplified text, the Broad Economy Policy Guidelines (BEPGs) and employment guidelines. They are the principal policy instrument for developing and implementing the Lisbon Strategy.     The employment guidelines are thus presented in an integrated policy instrument       *      Â which covers both the macroeconomic and the microeconomic aspects of the European Union (EU), presents a clear strategic vision of the challenges facing Europe and enables the Union to channel Member Statesâ€™ efforts towards priority measures. Certain employment guidelines are to be implemented in line with the corresponding guidelines in other areas in order to mutually strengthen the different sectors of the economy.     Firstly, to attract more people into employment and modernise social protection systems, the Commission proposes to:       Implement employment policies intended to achieve full employment, improve quality and productivity at work, and strengthen social and territorial cohesion (Integrated Guideline No 17).        Â These policies should help to achieve an average employment rate for the European Union (EU) of 70% overall, at least 60% for women and 50% for older workers (55 to 64), and to reduce unemployment and inactivity. Member States should set national employment rate targets.        Promote a new lifecycle approach to work (Integrated Guideline No 18)        Â through:- renewed endeavours to build employment pathways for young people and reduce youth unemployment, as recommended in the         European Youth Pact        ,- resolute action to increase female participation and reduce gender gaps in employment, unemployment and pay,- better reconciliation of work and private life and the provision of accessible and affordable childcare facilities and care for dependants,- support for working conditions conducive to active ageing,- modernisation of social protection systems, including pensions and healthcare, to ensure their social adequacy, financial sustainability and responsiveness to changing needs, so as to support participation in employment, remaining at work and longer working lives.      This guideline should be applied taking into account Guideline No 2 â€œTo safeguard economic and fiscal sustainabilityâ€.       Ensure inclusive labour markets, enhance work attractiveness, and make work pay attractive for job-seekers, including disadvantaged people and the inactive (Integrated Guideline No 19)        Â through:- active and preventive labour market measures, including early identification of needs, job search assistance, guidance and training as part of personalised action plans, and provision of necessary social services to support the inclusion of those furthest away from the labour market and contribute to the eradication of poverty,- ongoing review of the incentives and disincentives resulting from the tax and benefit systems, including the management and conditionality of benefits and a significant reduction of high marginal effective tax rates, notably for those with low incomes, whilst ensuring adequate levels of social protection,- development of new sources of jobs in services for individuals and businesses, notably at local level.        Improve matching of labour market needs (Integrated Guideline No 20)        Â through:- the modernisation and strengthening of labour market institutions, especially employment services, also with a view to ensuring greater transparency of employment and training opportunities at national and European level,- removing obstacles to mobility for workers across Europe within the framework of the Treaties,- better anticipation of skill needs, labour market shortages and bottlenecks,- appropriate management of economic migration.      Secondly, to improve the adaptability of workers and enterprises and the flexibility of labour markets, the Commission proposes to:       Promote flexibility combined with employment security and reduce labour market segmentation, having due regard to the role of the social partners (Integrated Guideline No 21)        Â through:- adaptation of employment legislation, reviewing where necessary the different contractual and working time arrangements,- addressing the issue of undeclared work,- better anticipation and positive management of change, including economic restructuring, for example changes linked to the opening of markets, so as to minimise their social costs and facilitate adaptation,- promotion and dissemination of innovative and adaptable forms of work organisation, with a view to improving quality and productivity at work, including health and safety,- facilitating changes in occupational status, including training, self-employment, business creation and geographical mobility.      This guideline should be applied taking into account Guideline No 5 â€œTo promote greater coherence between macroeconomic, structural and employment policiesâ€, in relation to macroeconomic policy.       Ensure employment-friendly labour cost developments and wage-setting mechanisms (Integrated Guideline No 22)        Â by:- encouraging social partners within their own areas of responsibility to set the right framework for wage bargaining in order to reflect productivity and labour market challenges at all relevant levels and to avoid gender pay gaps,- reviewing the impact on employment of non-wage labour costs and, where appropriate, adjusting their structure and level, especially to reduce the tax burden on the low-paid.      This guideline should be applied taking into account Guideline No 4 â€œTo ensure that wage developments contribute to macroeconomic stability and growthâ€, in relation to macroeconomic policy.     Thirdly, to invest more in human capital through better education and skills, the Commission proposes to:       Expand and improve investment in human capital (Integrated Guideline No 23)        Â through:- inclusive education and training policies and action to ensure significantly easier access to initial vocational, secondary and higher education, including apprenticeships and entrepreneurship training,- significantly reducing the number of early school leavers,- efficient lifelong learning strategies open to everyone in schools, businesses, public authorities and households according to European agreements, including appropriate incentives and cost-sharing mechanisms, with a view to ensuring lifelong participation in continuous and workplace training, especially for the low-skilled and older workers.      This guideline should be applied taking account of Guideline No 7 â€œTo increase and improve investment in R&D, in particular by private businessâ€, in relation to microeconomic policy.       Adapt education and training systems in response to new competence requirements (Integrated Guideline No 24)        Â through:- raising and ensuring the attractiveness, openness and quality standards of education and training, broadening the supply of education and training opportunities, ensuring flexible learning pathways and increasing mobility possibilities for students and trainees,- facilitating and diversifying access for everyone to education, training and knowledge through the organisation of working hours, family support services, career guidance services and, where appropriate, new forms of cost-sharing,- responding to new occupational needs, key competences and future skill requirements by improving the definition and transparency of qualifications, their effective recognition and validation of non-formal and informal learning.      Updates during the period up to 2008 should be strictly limited. The Commission is presenting the Integrated Guidelines as part of the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy.         Integrated guidelines for growth and jobs (2005-2008)              Macroeconomic guidelines              (1) To secure economic stability for sustainable growth.(2) To safeguard economic and budgetary sustainability.(3) To promote a growth- and employment-orientated and efficient allocation of resources.(4) To ensure that wage developments contribute to economic stability.(5) To promote greater coherence between macroeconomic, structural and employment policies.(6) To contribute to a dynamic and well-functioning EMU.

As in 2006,Â the Council maintained its guidelines in 2007 but stressed that they should be taken into account by the Member States in their policies.      Council Decision         2006/544/EC        of 18 July 2006 on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States [OJ L 215 of 5.8.2006].      In view of the essential role of employment policies under the Lisbon agenda, the Council urged the Member States to ensure the application of all the 2005â€“2008 guidelines as part of their national employment programmes. Updating of these guidelines should be limited in order to ensure the stability necessary for effective implementation. The Council therefore decided not to amend the guidelines for 2006.     Last updated: 03.10.2007  
act   Directive  2006/25/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to risks arising from physical agents (artificial optical radiation) (19th individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive  89/391/EEC)  .   summary   This Directive is part of a package of four Directives regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents:  noise  ,  vibration  ,  electromagnetic fields  and optical radiation.  This is a Directive under framework Directive  89/391/EEC  on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the  safety and health of workers at work  .   Risks of optical radiation and scope   The exposure of workers to artificial optical radiation , laser , laser radiation and non-coherent radiation can have chronic adverse effects on the eyes and skin.  This Directive reduces the level of exposure to this radiation firstly by the introduction of preventive measures in the design of workstations, in order to reduce the risks at source. It also fixes exposure limit values for workers exposed to non-coherent radiation and laser radiation (Annex 2).   Obligations of employers    Assessment of the level of radiation. Firstly, the employer assesses or measures the levels of optical radiation to which employees are exposed so that they can be reduced if they exceed the applicable limits. He measures them on the basis of the standards of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the International Commission on Illumination (CEI) and the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) or, failing that, using available national or international science-based guidelines.   Reduction of the risks. Secondly, the employer must reduce the level of radiation if the assessment indicates any possibility that the exposure limit values have been exceeded, for example by choosing a different material or limiting the duration of exposure.   Worker information and training. The workers or their representatives receive the necessary information and training, for example in the use of protective equipment.   Consultation and participation of workers. Employers must consult workers or their representatives in advance with regard to the protection of the safety and health of workers. They may propose measures to improve this protection and even enlist the competent authorities if they consider that the health protection offered by the employer is not adequate (in accordance with framework Directive  89/391/EEC)  .    Health surveillance   The health of workers is subject to surveillance carried out by a doctor, as is any risk arising from exposure to optical radiation, in accordance with the relevant national legislation.  Health records are made for each worker and updated after each health check. On request, individual workers may have access to their own personal health records.   Harmful effects and/or exceeding of limit values   In the event of exposure exceeding the limit values, a medical examination is automatically made available to the workers. If the limit values have been exceeded and/or the workers have suffered harmful effects to their health:   the worker is informed by the doctor or qualified person of the results relating to him and any significant findings;   the employer reviews the risk assessment and the measures taken, implements the measures recommended by the competent persons and establishes a continuous surveillance system.    Penalties   The Member States must provide for appropriate penalties if the national provisions adopted pursuant to the Directive have been infringed.   Reports   Every five years, the Member States provide the Commission with a report on the practical implementation of this Directive, including the opinions of the social partners.  Every five years, the Commission informs the European Parliament, the Council, and the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) and the Advisory Committee on Safety and Health at Work of its assessment of these reports.

   Action on HIV/AIDS in the European Union and neighbouring countries 2006 - 2009     Action on HIV/AIDS in the European Union and neighbouring countries 2006 - 2009     Building on its working paper entitled "Coordinated and integrated approach to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic within the European Union and in its neighbourhood", the European Commission is trying to bring together all of the interested parties in a joint action programme. In this paper the Commission lays down targets and measures to be implemented by the end of 2009 for each of the areas in which action is needed. More detailed proposals for the main areas of action for the period 2006 - 2010 are presented in the Annex.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 15 December 2005 on combating HIV/AIDS within the European Union and in the neighbouring countries, 2006-2009 [       COM(2005) 654      final - Not published in the Official Journal]     SUMMARY     There are signs of a decline in action on HIV/AIDS at the moment, particularly as regards prevention, surveillance and measures to combat discrimination. This trend runs counter to the targets which have been set, regarding for example the elimination of mother-to-child transmission and universal access to treatment.     In view of this, the European Commission plans to promote joint action at Community level to complement national and international initiatives. The measures to be taken under this initiative will be targeted on:      the involvement of civil society;       surveillance;       prevention;       testing;       treatment, care and support;       research;       cooperation with neighbouring countries.       Involvement of civil society      The main objective in this area is to increase the involvement of civil society in all aspects of the fight against HIV/AIDS.     Several initiatives have already been taken with this aim in mind:      representatives of civil society have become involved in the HIV/AIDS Think Tank;       a forum of 30 European organisations has been set up to improve the exchange of information.      In future, the Commission plans to foster cooperation and dialogue with patients and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to ensure that they are even more actively involved in the design, implementation and follow-up of policy on HIV/AIDS. In an effort to strengthen its partnership with the private sector, the Commission is also inviting representatives of industry, including the Union of Industrial and Employers Confederations of Europe (UNICE), to strengthen their response to the epidemic and to play their part in implementing the EU's HIV/AIDS prevention strategy.      Surveillance      The objectives in the area of surveillance are as follows:      to improve and harmonise surveillance systems to monitor the epidemic, risk behaviour and vulnerability to HIV/AIDS;       to ensure effective provision of data and information on other sexually transmitted infections;       to support surveillance of HIV testing.      Surveillance of HIV/AIDS in Europe has until now been coordinated by the EuroHIV network, which is co-financed by the Commission. In 2008 the       European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control      (ECDC) will assume responsibility for this network.     The Commission plans to take the following measures, working with the Member States, neighbouring countries, the ECDC and other partners:      help to introduce complete geographic coverage of HIV case reporting;       reassess the objectives of AIDS surveillance and include its reporting in an integrated surveillance system;       design a standardised approach for appropriate prevention indicators;       develop estimates of HIV incidence in Europe;       facilitate the setting-up of sentinel surveillance in high-risk groups;       facilitate implementation of practical solutions to address the confidentiality obstacles.       Prevention      The measures to be taken in the area of prevention will aim primarily:      to facilitate the implementation of the measures adopted;       to ensure that all citizens have access to information, education and services;       to improve services for injecting drug users;       to prevent discrimination against migrants;       to support the monitoring and evaluation of the methods used.      In the absence of a vaccine or cure, prevention remains the most effective way to combat HIV/AIDS. In view of the situation within the European Union (constant increase in the number of cases), there is a need to step up prevention activities both among the general public and among specific groups (young people, women, sex workers, drug users, etc.).     The Commission therefore intends to promote:      the implementation of prevention programmes, particularly for the most vulnerable groups;       safe sex ;       measures to address the increase in risk-taking behaviour among young people;       the evaluation of the risks of mother-to-child transmission and the risks associated with drug dependence;       the development of training programmes for healthcare staff and other professionals caring for those with HIV/AIDS.       Counselling, testing, treatment and support      The objectives in this field are:      to combat discrimination against and stigmatisation of those living with HIV/AIDS;       to promote universal access to effective treatment and care;       to improve social and labour market integration;      These objectives are all interlinked. For example, affordable and accessible services and good treatment reduce stigmatisation and social exclusion. They also encourage responsible sexual behaviour, which helps to prevent the spread of the virus.     The measures to attain these objectives will focus on:      capacity-building among service providers;       enhancing the role of NGOs active in this field;       further developing HIV/AIDS surveillance at European level;       producing a set of European reference models for Member States and European Neighbourhood Policy partners;       access to antiretroviral drugs, counselling and testing.       Research      In this area the Commission plans:      to increase commitments to research and development for vaccines and microbicides;       to promote access to treatment by developing affordable treatments and diagnosis;       to support public health research;       to support private sector involvement;       to support the use of behavioural prevention methods.      Since the entry into force of the       Sixth Framework Programme of Research and Development      research into HIV/AIDS has become a top priority for the European Commission. EUR 50 million has been allocated to financing research into prevention and treatment. There has also been an emphasis on the new Member States and neighbouring countries in eastern Europe, which have been invited to take part in both EU-funded proposals, such as the network of excellence on therapeutic clinical trials, and the evaluation process.     Reflecting the Commission's desire for continuity, the Seventh Framework Programme, soon to be negotiated with the Member States, will continue to give priority to HIV/AIDS research. The Commission has proposed an increase in the funding allocated to this programme, particularly in the area of biotechnology, translational research and delivery of healthcare.      HIV/AIDS and the European Neighbourhood Policy      The European Commission intends to increase the involvement of neighbouring countries       *      in the EU's HIV/AIDS activities in order to perpetuate the exchange of information and best practice.     The Commission will also call on these countries to look into ways of developing a coordinated approach to the HIV/AIDS epidemic through the HIV/AIDS Think Tank and the Civil Society Forum.      Action Plan      The Action Plan annexed to the Communication sets out the measures to be taken according to a strict timetable by the parties involved in each of the priority areas. The various proposals stress in particular the exchange of best practice, training and programmes to raise public awareness.       Key terms used in the act         Neighbouring countries: Russian Federation, Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Moldova, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, Syria, Tunisia, Ukraine.

   Ceramic objects in contact with foodstuffs     Ceramic objects in contact with foodstuffs     Ceramics can transfer toxins (lead and cadmium) to foodstuffs with which they are in contact. Only ceramic objects intended to come into contact with foodstuffs must be accompanied by a written declaration from the manufacturer or seller stating that they do not exceed the maximum limits for the transfer of lead and cadmium.     ACT     Council Directive       84/500/EEC      of 15 October 1984 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to ceramic articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     Ceramic objects used to contain foodstuffs may transfer lead and cadmium to these foodstuffs. These two metals are toxic and can constitute a risk to human health.     The Directive lays down maximum limits for the cadmium and lead transferred by ceramic objects to the foodstuffs with which they enter into contact.      Declaration of conformity      To be sold, these ceramics must be accompanied by a written declaration provided by the manufacturer or importer, guaranteeing that they do not exceed the maximum limits for lead and cadmium. The information required is described in Annex II (introduced by Directive       2005/31/EC)      .     The declaration was introduced to meet the requirements of       Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004      on materials and articles intended to come into contact with food (Directive       84/500/EEC      is a measure specific to the groups of materials and objects listed in Regulation (EC) No       1935/2004      ).     The maximum limits for lead and cadmium must be checked by means of a test and a method of analysis (Annex III, introduced by Directive       2005/31/EC)      .     These methods take into account the very latest scientific progress in methods of analysis for official tests of lead and cadmium in foodstuffs, in accordance with Directive       2001/22/EC      (see the Associated Acts heading below).

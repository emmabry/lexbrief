summary of   Strategy to support EU countries in reducing alcohol-related harm — COM(2006) 625 final   summary    what does this communication do  It establishes a strategy to support EU countries in reducing the health, economic and social problems related to harmful and hazardous alcohol consumption.  The strategy sets priority themes, identifies the different levels of action and lists the measures taken by EU countries to encourage good practices. It also invites all other interested parties to take measures to reduce alcohol-related harm. Action by the European Commission has complemented national strategies in this area.   key points    Five priorities     1.     Protecting young people, childrenand the unborn child  — this includes 3 specific aims:    curbing underage drinking, and reducing hazardous and harmful drinking among young people,   reducing the harm suffered by children in families with alcohol-related problems,   reducing exposure to alcohol during pregnancy.        2.     Reducing alcohol-related road deaths and injuries       3.    Reducing alcohol-related harm among adults and its negative impact on the workplace  — the specific aims are to:   decrease alcohol-related chronic physical and mental disorders,   decrease the number of alcohol-related deaths,   provide information to consumers so that they can make informed choices,   contribute to the reduction of alcohol-related harm at the workplace.        4.     Informing, educating and raising awareness  — particular emphasis is placed on the impact of harmful and hazardous alcohol consumption on:    the unborn child,   underage drinkers,   working and driving performance.        5.     Developing, supporting and maintaining a common evidence base  — gathering comparable information on a number of issues including:    consumption levels,   drinking patterns,   social and health effects of alcohol.       Supporting EU countries   The EU’s role in this strategy is to complement the efforts of EU countries, add value to their actions and to enable EU countries to work together to deal with common issues.  A 3-year  joint action on reducing alcohol-related harm (RARHA)  , funded under the  EU health programme  , started in January 2014. It aims to support EU countries’ progress towards common priorities in line with the EU alcohol strategy, and to help them to address and reduce alcohol-related harm.   Implementation of the Strategy    A 2013  report  found that most EU countries had updated and strengthened their alcohol strategies in the direction of the EU strategy.   The EU strategy in the 5 priority areas was found to have shown clear results in terms of supporting EU countries’ action.   Coordination and support for EU countries could be enhanced by increasing the visibility of the  Committee on National Alcohol Policy and Action (CNAPA)  and introducing a multi-year work plan.   Interested parties could be encouraged to become involved in the  EU Alcohol and Health Forum  .   background    Alcohol policy   act   Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: An EU strategy to support Member States in reducing alcohol-related harm (  COM(2006) 625 final  of 24.10.2006)
summary of   Regulation (EU) No 1285/2013 on the implementation and exploitation of European satellite navigation systems    Decision No 1104/2011/EU – rules for access to the public regulated service provided by the global navigation satellite system established under the Galileo programme    Decision 2014/496/CFSP on aspects of the deployment, operation and use of the European Global Navigation Satellite System affecting the EU’s security   what is the aim of the regulation and the decisions   Regulation (EU) No 1285/2013:   sets out the rules for the management and financing of the  EU  ’s  2 satellite navigation systems  ,  Galileo  and  EGNOS  (European geostationary navigation overlay service). Each set of infrastructure consists of satellites and a network of ground stations.   aims to meet the needs of the 2 programmes, particularly in terms of governance and security, ensure their financial management is sound and their use is promoted.     Decision No 1104/2011/EU lays down the rules on access to the  public regulated service (PRS)  provided by the global navigation satellite system established under the Galileo programme.   Decision 2014/496/CFSP concerns aspects of the deployment, operation and use of the European Global Navigation Satellite System affecting the EU’s security.   key points    Galileo    aims to set up and operate the  first global satellite navigation and positioning infrastructure  (system providing navigation, time and location data)  specifically designed for civilian purposes  , which can be used by a variety of public and private actors in Europe and worldwide. The new system is being designed to function independently of other existing systems — such as the United States’  global positioning system  (GPS), Russia’s  Glonass  system or China’s  BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS)  — or other potential systems;   apart from the  open service  (OS), offers  a public regulated service  (PRS) restricted to government-authorised users (for sensitive applications which require a high level of service continuity), as well as contributes to the  search and rescue support service  (SAR) of the  COSPAS-SARSAT  system;   is designed to be interoperable with other global satellite navigation systems. This interoperability will allow manufacturers to develop terminals processing more than one system.   Implementing Decision (EU)  2016/413  sets out the  location of the various ground-based components  comprising Galileo’s infrastructure, including:   2  control centres  — in  Germany  and  Italy  ;   a  security monitoring centre  divided between 2 locations — in  France  and the  United Kingdom (UK)  (   1   );   a  reference centre  — in the  Netherlands  .   In light of the UK (   1   ) withdrawal from the EU, Implementing Decision (EU)  2018/115  amended Decision (EU) 2016/413 launching the process of transfer of the  security monitoring centre  from the UK (   1   ) to  Spain  .   EGNOS    aims  to improve the quality of open signals from existing global navigation satellite systems  (GNSS) as well as those from the  open service  offered by the Galileo system;   offers certain sophisticated safety-critical applications such as for guiding aircraft both vertically and horizontally during landing approaches or navigating ships through narrow channels.    Financing   The EU is making around  €7 billion  of funding available for related activities from 2014 until 2020. The  European Commission  has overall responsibility for the 2 programmes and manages the funds.  The funding is used for:   the  completion of the deployment phase of the Galileo programme  by 31 December 2020 (e.g. the construction and protection of space-based and ground-based infrastructure);   the  exploitation phase of the Galileo programme  (e.g. management, maintenance, improvement and protection of space-based and ground-based infrastructure);   the  exploitation phase of the EGNOS programme  (e.g. management, maintenance, improvement and protection of space-based and ground-based infrastructure);   the  management and monitoring  of the Galileo and EGNOS programmes.    Implementation report   In 2017, the Commission published a  report  on the implementation of the Galileo and EGNOS programmes. The report concludes that the Galileo and EGNOS programmes have achieved all the milestones that were set for the period concerned and progress is being made towards delivering on all the programme implementation objectives set for 2020.   European GNSS Agency and European Space Agency (ESA)   The regulation determines the roles of the European GNSS Agency and the European Space Agency, emphasising the principle of a strict division of tasks and responsibilities between the entities (in particular the Commission, the European GNSS Agency and ESA, under the overall responsibility of the Commission) involved in the governance of the Galileo and EGNOS programmes.   GNSS   In the context of the GNSS, 2 additional decisions deserve mention:    Decision No 1104/2011/EU  sets out the rules under which the EU countries, the  Council  , the Commission, the  EEAS  ,  EU agencies  , non-EU countries and international organisations may access the PRS provided by the GNSS established under the Galileo programme. The PRS is a secure and encrypted service for sensitive applications and must remain operational even in crisis situations when other services may be interrupted. Access must be restricted to authorised users, mainly public authorities, such as the police, authorities responsible for border controls or authorities responsible for civil protection.    Decision 2014/496/CFSP  deals with aspects of the deployment, operation and use of the GNSS affecting the EU’s security. It sets out the responsibilities of the Council and the  High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy  to avert a threat to the security of the EU or 1 or more EU countries or to mitigate serious harm to the essential interests of the EU or of 1 or more EU countries arising from the deployment, operation or use of the European GNSS, in particular as a result of an international situation requiring action by the EU or in the event of a threat to the operation of the system itself or its services.   from when do the regulation and the decisions apply  Rgulation (EU) No 1285/2013has applied since 1 January 2014.  Decision No 1104/2011/EU has applied since 5 November 2011.

summary of   Directive 2003/109/EC — status of non-EU nationals who are long-term residents   what is the aim of the directive   It sets out the terms and conditions for granting — and withdrawing — long-term residence status to non-European Union citizens (third-country nationals  *  ) living legally in a European Union (EU) country for at least 5 years.   It determines their rights and the areas where they enjoy equal treatment with EU citizens.   It spells out the conditions which apply if they wish to move to another EU country.   key points    To obtain long-term resident status, non-EU citizens must have lived legally and continuously in an EU country for 5 years.   Absences of less than 6 consecutive months and no more than 10 months over the whole period are permitted when calculating the 5 years.   Non-EU nationals must prove they have stable and regular economic resources to support themselves and their family and have sickness insurance.   National authorities must give a decision on applications, accompanied by the relevant documentation, within 6 months of receiving them.   Authorities may refuse to grant resident status for reasons of public policy or public security, but not for economic reasons.   Successful applicants are given a residence permit that is valid for at least 5 years and is automatically renewable.   Long-term residents may lose that status if they:   acquired it by fraud;   are issued with an expulsion order because they are considered a serious threat to public policy or security; or   leave the EU for 12 consecutive months.     Long-term residents enjoy equal treatment with the country’s nationals in areas such as employment, education, social security, taxation and freedom of association. However, in certain cases, EU countries may restrict this  equal treatment  .   Long-term residents may move to live, work or study in another EU country for more than 3 months, provided they satisfy certain conditions. They may be accompanied by their family members.   National contact points exist to send and receive the relevant information between EU countries.   The legislation does not apply to certain categories of non-EU nationals, such as  students  or those working temporarily as au pairs or  seasonal workers.    The legislation does not apply in the UK (   1   ), Ireland or Denmark which have special arrangements for immigration and asylum policy.  In 2011, the directive was amended to cover non-EU citizens, such as refugees or the stateless, who enjoy international protection.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 23 January 2004. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 23 January 2006.   background   For more information, see:    ‘Long-term residents’  on the European Commission's website.

summary of   Directive 2011/91/EU on indications or marks identifying the lot to which a foodstuff belongs   summary    what does this directive do        —     It makes sure that consumers can trace the origin of pre-packaged foods.            —     It requires these foods to be labelled so that consumers can see which lot they come from.            —     It ensures that public health and food safety authorities can find out the origin and identity of pre-packaged foods in the event that these are the subject of a dispute or are a health hazard for consumers.            —     It sets out rules for producers, manufacturers, packagers and importers for labelling these foods using a common lot identification system.      key points    Scope   The Directive applies to all  pre-packaged foods  apart from:        —     agricultural products which are:        —     in temporary storage, preparation or packaging stations;             —     transported to producers’ organisations; or             —     collected for immediate processing.                 —     foods that are not prepackaged when on sale to the final consumer, are packaged at the purchaser's request or prepackaged for immediate sale;            —     packaging or containers whose largest side is less than 10cm  2  ;            —     individual portions of ice cream packaged together, where the lot identification must appear on the outside of the combined package.       Labelling of lots         —     Each lot must be labelled by the producer, manufacturer or packager, or the first seller based within the EU if it is imported.            —     The lot identification must be preceded by the letter ‘L’ except if is clearly distinguishable from the other information on the label.            —     The information on the label must be easily  visible  ,  clearly legible  and  indelible  .            —     There is no need to indicate the lot if the ‘use by’ date appears on the label.      from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 5 January 2012.   key term    * Lot  : a batch of sales units of a foodstuff produced, manufactured or packaged under practically the same conditions   act   Directive  2011/91/EU  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on indications or marks identifying the lot to which a foodstuff belongs (OJ L 334, 16.12.2011, pp. 1–5)
summary of   Directive (EU) 2019/790 on copyright in the Digital Single Market   what is the aim of the directive  The directive has 3 main objectives:   to adapt certain key exceptions to copyright to the digital and the cross-border environment;   to improve licensing practices and ensure wider access to content; and   to achieve a well-functioning marketplace for copyright.   key points   The directive updates but does not replace the 11 directives which together comprise the  EU's copyright legislation  . These include:   Directive 2001/29/EC on the  harmonisation of copyright in the information society  ; and   the directives on:   the  enforcement of intellectual property rights  (Directive 2004/48/EC);    orphan works  (Directive 2012/28/EU); and   the  collective management of copyright and related rights  (Directive 2014/26/EU).      Copyright exceptions to give wider access   The directive makes it easier to use copyright-protected material for different purposes, mostly related to access to knowledge, by introducing mandatory exceptions to copyright to foster:   text- and data-mining  *  ;   digital uses of works for the purpose of illustration for teaching; and   the preservation of cultural heritage.   It facilitates licensing to give wider access to content, in particular by providing:   a new system to make it easier for cultural heritage institutions, such as libraries, museums and archives, to digitise and disseminate, including online and across borders in the EU, out-of-commerce works that they have in their collections;   a specific rule on extended collective licensing and similar mechanisms;   a negotiation mechanism to help interested parties reach agreements for the making available of audiovisual works on video-on-demand platforms.   The directive also clarifies that anyone can use and share without restriction copies of works of art in the public domain (for example, a picture of a sculpture no longer covered by copyright), under certain conditions.   Protection of press publications for online use    There are new rights granted to EU-based press publishers for the digital use of their press publications, although these rights only apply to uses by online service providers and not to private or non-commercial uses by individual users. Acts of hyperlinking and very short extracts from press publications are not subject to these new rights.   Authors of works included in a press publication should receive an appropriate share of the income derived from its use.    Use of protected content by online content-sharing platforms    Online content-sharing service providers should obtain permission from rights holders to make works uploaded by their users available to the public, for example through a licensing agreement. If a licence is not concluded, the concerned platforms benefit from a liability-mitigation mechanism, but they have to make ‘best efforts’ to make sure that unauthorised content is not available on their websites. They must make those efforts on the basis of relevant and necessary information provided by the rightholders.   Users are allowed to post content for the specific purposes of quotation, criticism, review, caricature, parody or pastiche and may use complaint and redress mechanisms in case of disputes over content erroneously blocked or removed from the platforms.    Fair remuneration for authors and performers   EU countries should ensure that a principle of appropriate and proportionate remuneration applies when an author or performer has transferred or licensed his rights for exploitation by another party (e.g. a publisher or a producer).   Transparency and revocation   Authors and performers should receive regularly - at least once a year - up-to-date, relevant and comprehensive information on the exploitation of their works and performances. They have a right of revocation, after a reasonable period of time, in the event of non-use of the work or performance.   Modifying contracts   The negotiating rights of authors and performers are strengthened. They have the right to claim from the party with whom they have a contract for the exploitation of rights, appropriate and fair additional remuneration in cases where the remuneration initially agreed is unreasonably low in relation to all subsequent income resulting from exploitation of the works.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 6 June 2019 and must become law in all EU countries by 7 June 2021.   background   For more information, see:    Copyright  (  European Commission  )    Digital Single Market  - Factsheet (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Text- and data-mining:  any automated analytical technique aiming to analyse text and data in digital form in order to generate information such as patterns, trends and correlations.
   Equal opportunities report 2001     Equal opportunities report 2001     1) OBJECTIVE     To present an overview of the main developments and achievements in the field of equal opportunities in 2001 - at both European and national level - and to describe the outlook for 2002.     2) ACT     Communication from the Commission, of 28 May 2002, to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - Annual Report on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men in the European Union 2001 [       COM(2002) 258      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     3) SUMMARY      Framework strategy on gender equality (2001-2005)      The       Community framework strategy      , adopted in June 2000, is aimed both at integrating the gender dimension in all Community policies that have an impact on the equal opportunities objective (principle of mainstreaming) and at promoting the introduction of specific measures to reduce inequalities. In 2001, noticeable progress was made with regard to both the integration of gender issues in the various policies and the introduction of specific measures.     As regards the mainstreaming of gender equality in Community policies, significant advances were noted in a number of areas, including the following:       enterprise        : a study aimed at identifying and evaluating good practices in relation to the promotion of female entrepreneurship was launched, while another study to assess the gender impact of the "Innovation and SMEs" specific programme within the 5th framework research programme (1998-2002) was finalised and published recently.        Broad Economic Policy Guidelines        : the Belgian Presidency of the European Union (EU) - July-December 2001 - launched an initiative to strengthen gender mainstreaming in the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines;        the Barcelona process        : under the         MEDA        programme for cooperation with southern Mediterranean countries, a regional forum on the role of women in economic development was held in Brussels in July 2001;        education and continuing training        : an action plan for gender equality (2001-2002) was adopted by the         Socrates        Committee in February 2001. The first phase is concerned with evaluating the gender dimension and the second phase with identifying indicators for improving the implementation of gender equality;        humanitarian aid        : in 2001, the European Humanitarian Aid Office (         ECHO        ) continued to incorporate the gender dimension in humanitarian aid. For example, it funded projects focusing on the specific needs of women, particularly in Iraq, Serbia and Afghanistan;        the employment strategy        : in connection with the adoption of the annual employment package, on 12 September 2001 the Commission sent a set of recommendations to eleven Member States encouraging them to strengthen equality between women and men;        combating violence and trafficking        : implementation of the         DAPHNE        and         STOP        programmes continued in 2001 and the Commission adopted a new         STOP II        programme (to run until 2003). The implementation of the STOP II programme provided an opportunity to focus on assisting and protecting women who are the victims of violence;        the social inclusion process        : in June 2001, the Member States drew up their first biennial national action plans based on common objectives to combat poverty and social exclusion. In these plans, most Member States identified higher risks of poverty and social exclusion among elderly women, single parents and victims of domestic violence. Even though many Member States are committed to enhancing the mainstreaming of the gender dimension over the next two years, there is still a lot to be done to find a consistent approach to gender needs and characteristics across all the strands of these plans.      As provided for in Decision       2000/407/EC      of 19 June 2007, the Commission is committed to achieving a       male/female balance in committees      and expert groups, with a target of 40% minimum participation of both women and men. Following a first survey in 2000 among certain expert groups of the Commission in which an average of only 13.5% of the members were women, a second, much more comprehensive survey was conducted in 2001. In that year, the average percentage of women in all the Commission's committees and expert groups was 28.8%. Among the members of those committees and expert groups for which the Commission had the right of appointment, 30.5% were women, whilst among the committees and groups on whose membership the Commission had no influence 28.4% were women.     The Member States continued to carry out a whole series of activities aimed at promoting equality between women and men and mainstreaming the gender dimension. The many initiatives taken include the example set by Austria, which adopted a project aimed at increasing the presence of women in the technology sector, especially IT. In Sweden, the law on equality between men and women was strengthened in January 2001. In the United Kingdom, a new government telephone helpline "Equality Direct" - backed up by a website - designed to provide firms with free information and advice on all equality-related issues was set up.     Equal pay was the priority theme chosen for 2001 under the Community framework strategy on gender equality and the associated funding programme. It was chosen because it is the most visible inequality in the European labour market. Despite the existence of legal provisions on this subject, women still earn an average of 14% less than men (in 1997, this difference was more pronounced in the private sector - 19% - than in the public sector - 10%).     The high profile given to the issue of equal pay was reflected in the conclusions of the Stockholm European Council (March 2001), which called on the Council and the Commission to develop appropriate indicators. This preparatory work enabled the Belgian Presidency to produce a set of indicators on pay differentials between women and men. Moreover, in September 2001 the European Parliament adopted a report on equal pay, which confirmed that a diversified approach would have to be adopted by all parties, whether European institutions, Member States or social partners, in order to obtain tangible results. The European Employment Strategy also plays an important part in achieving the objective of equal pay. Following the evaluation of the national plans for 2001, certain Member States announced various initiatives aimed at reducing pay differentials. However, the efforts will have to be continued if these initiatives are to come to anything and the social partners are to take an active part. Lastly, it is important to stress that the majority of the 27 projects selected in 2001 under the action programme address the issue of equal pay. Their funding amounts to a total of around 8 million euro. The first results of these projects are expected in 2003.     The following priority themes have been chosen for the programme on gender equality over the next few years:      2001-2002: equal pay;       2002-2003: reconciliation of work and family life;       2003-2004: women in decision-making;       2004-2005: gender stereotyping.       Legal developments      Substantial progress was made in 2001 on the proposal to amend the 1976 Directive on       equal treatment      in employment. The amended Directive is expected to break new ground in a number of important areas, including:      recognition of sexual harassment as discrimination on grounds of sex;       encouraging employers to prepare annual equality plans;       strengthening of the provisions concerning the judicial protection and compensation available to individuals in the event of discrimination;       strengthening of persons' rights regarding maternity or paternity leave.      In response to questions put by national courts about cases relating to gender equality, the Court of Justice of the European Communities handed down three major rulings in 2001:      the judgements given in the Melgar and Tele Danmark cases, according to which instances of dismissal or non-renewal of an open-ended employment contract by reason of pregnancy constitute direct and unjustifiable discrimination on grounds of sex;       the Menauer case, in which the Court held that German pension funds entrusted with administering occupational pension schemes were bound by the principle of equal pay in the same way as an employer;       the Griesmar and Mouflin cases relating to two provisions of the French Civil and Military Pensions Code that discriminate against men, which were declared incompatible with Community law.      As regards the main developments in Member States' legislation, a Finnish collective agreement provides that every sector can henceforth create a special equality allowance, which is designed to raise the remuneration of women who are not paid sufficiently well despite the difficulty of their work and their education in traditionally low-paid industrial sectors. In Denmark, the Equal Pay Act has been amended so that it is now more transparent. As far as national case law is concerned, the UK Employment Appeals Tribunal has broadened the definition of "comparator" so as to allow an employee of a local authority to compare him or herself with an employee of another local authority even where the two salary scales had been agreed independently. Paternity leave has been introduced in Greece and legislation on this subject has been proposed in France, Finland and the UK. Moreover, Greece, Ireland and the Netherlands have introduced legislation on the extension of maternity leave.      Equality in the enlargement process      The work of transposing European legislation on equal opportunities is under way in the candidate countries, some of which already obtained good results in 2001. However, the legislation in itself is not sufficient. The introduction of support mechanisms is just as essential to the achievement of gender equality. In this context, it is vital to have institutional and administrative structures that facilitate the implementation of and respect for rights relating to equality. Substantial efforts still need to be made in this direction.      Outlook for 2002      In 2002, the spotlight will be on reconciliation of work and family life. Various initiatives will be launched at European level in order to raise the profile of this issue, to finance transnational projects, to improve the statistics and indicators and to draw up a report on the application of the parental leave Directive.     The Commission will also submit a proposal for a directive on discrimination on the grounds of sex. This new legal basis will make it possible to take action in areas other than employment and social security, which at present constitute the relatively limited field of application of Community law on equality.     In 2002, the fight against trafficking in women and violence and the enhancement of the importance given to gender equality in the EU's external policies and the actions of the Structural Funds will continue to be policy priorities. Lastly, in line with the current evaluation of the participation of women in the decision-making process and with an eye to the European Parliament elections in 2004, the Commission plans to focus its activities in 2003 on promoting the gender balance in decision-making.      4) implementing measures       -       5) follow-up work        Report from the Commission, of 5 March 2003, to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - Annual Report on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men in the European Union 2002 [           COM(2003) 98          final - Not published in the Official Journal].

EU countries apply rules on the import and export of endangered species of animals and plants, and products derived from them.   key points    Trade controls    The  import  of specimens of endangered species into the EU requires a permit issued by an authority of the EU country of destination or an import notification.    Export  from the EU requires an export permit or a re-export certificate issued by an authority of the EU country in which the specimens are located.   Categories of species are outlined in Annexes A to D of the regulation.   Trade in species listed in  Annex A  , such as the cheetah, is prohibited, while movement of live animals within the EU requires prior authorisation.   Movement of a live specimen of a species listed in  Annexes B and C  , such as the cobra or the mongoose, is subject to rules on certification and adequate housing and care, while  Annex D  covers other cases of the transit of live animals, whole skins and plant products.   Further restrictions may be imposed in specific circumstances, and EU countries may have their own tougher rules.   Special rules apply to specimens born and bred in captivity or that are the result of artificial reproduction, part of personal effects or destined for scientific institutions.    Organisation and communication     EU countries must:    designate customs offices to carry out the checks;   designate the management and scientific authorities responsible for implementation;   monitor compliance and penalise infringements;   draw up reports and exchange information on implementation and any permit rejections.      In February 2014, the  European Commission  issued a  communication  launching the debate on the EU’s approach in regard to wildlife trafficking. This was followed, in February 2016, by a Commission  action plan  on wildlife trafficking.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 1 June 1997.   background   For more information, see:    The European Union and Trade in Wild Fauna and Flora  (European Commission)
summary of   EU Charter of Fundamental Rights   what is the aim of the charter  It enshrines in European Union (EU) law a range of personal, civil, political, economic and social rights of EU citizens and residents.   key points    Content   The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the Charter) reaffirms, with due regard for the EU’s powers and tasks and for the principle of  subsidiarity  , the rights as they result, in particular, from the constitutional traditions and international obligations common to EU countries, the  European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms  , the Social Charters adopted by the EU and by the  Council of Europe  and the case-law of the  Court of Justice of the European Union  and of the  European Court of Human Rights  . By making fundamental rights clearer and more visible, it creates  legal certainty  within the EU.  The Charter of Fundamental Rights contains a preamble and 54 articles, grouped in 7 chapters:   chapter I:  dignity  (human dignity, the right to life, the right to the integrity of the person, prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, prohibition of slavery and forced labour);   chapter II:  freedoms  (the right to liberty and security, respect for private and family life,  protection of personal data  , the right to marry and found a family, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and information, freedom of assembly and association, freedom of the arts and sciences, the right to education, freedom to choose an occupation and the right to engage in work, freedom to conduct a business, the right to property, the  right to asylum  , protection in the event of removal, expulsion or extradition);   chapter III:  equality  (equality before the law,  non-discrimination  , cultural, religious and linguistic diversity,  equality between men and women  , the  rights of the child  , the rights of the elderly, integration of persons with disabilities);   chapter IV:  solidarity  (  workers’ right to information and consultation within the undertaking  , the right of collective bargaining and action, the right of access to placement services, protection in the event of unjustified dismissal, fair and just working conditions, prohibition of child labour and protection of young people at work, family and professional life, social security and social assistance, health care, access to  services of general economic interest  , environmental protection, consumer protection);   chapter V:  citizens’ rights  (the right to vote and stand as a candidate at elections to the  European Parliament  and at  municipal elections  , the right to good administration, the  right of access to documents  ,  European Ombudsman  , the  right to petition  , freedom of movement and residence,  diplomatic and consular protection  );   chapter VI:  justice  (the right to an effective remedy and a  fair trial  , presumption of innocence and the right of defence, principles of legality and proportionality of criminal offences and penalties, the right not to be tried or punished twice in criminal proceedings for the same criminal offence);   chapter VII:  general provisions  .    Scope   The charter applies to the European institutions, subject to the principle of subsidiarity, and may under no circumstances extend the powers and tasks conferred on them by the  treaties  . The charter also applies to EU countries when they implement EU law.  If any of the rights correspond to rights guaranteed by the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights, the meaning and scope of those rights is to be the same as defined by the convention, though EU law may provide for more extensive protection.   Annual reports   Every year since 2010, the  European Commission  publishes an  annual report  . This monitors progress on the application of the charter.   background    In 1999, the  European Council  concluded that the fundamental rights applicable at EU level should be consolidated in a charter to give them greater visibility.   The charter was formally proclaimed in Nice in December 2000 by the European Parliament, the  Council  and the Commission.   The Charter became legally binding on the EU with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, in December 2009 and now has the same legal value as the EU treaties.

   "Intelligent Energy for Europe" programme (2003-2006)     "Intelligent Energy for Europe" programme (2003-2006)     This Decision establishes a new multiannual programme for action in the field of energy. It reflects the European Union's current objectives in this field, namely sustainable development and security of supply, which reflects the European Union's current objectives in this field, namely sustainable development and security of supply.     ACT     Decision No       1230/2003/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 adopting a multiannual programme for action in the field of energy: "Intelligent Energy -- Europe" (2003-2006) [Official Journal L 176 of 15.7.2003].     SUMMARY     Energy and transport play a large part in climate change since they are the leading sources of greenhouse gas emissions; this is why energy policy is particularly important in the European Union's sustainable development strategy. The EU is increasingly dependent on energy imported from Non-EU Member Countries, creating economic, social, political and other risks for the Union.     The EU therefore wishes to reduce its dependence and improve its security of supply by promoting other energy sources and cutting demand for energy. Consequently, it is putting the accent, above all, on improving energy efficiency and promoting renewable energy sources.     This programme ensures the continuity of EU action as developed in the previous energy framework programme (1998-2002).      Aims      This new programme is aimed at providing financial support for local, regional and national initiatives in the field of renewable energy, energy efficiency, the energy aspects of transport, and international promotion. The budget is 200 million for the period 2003-2006.     The specific aims are:     - to provide the necessary factors to promote energy efficiency and develop renewable energy sources with a view to reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions;     - to develop resources and instruments which can be used by the Member States to monitor and evaluate the impact of the measures adopted by the Member States;     - to promote efficient and intelligent schemes for the production and consumption of energy, based on solid and sustainable foundations, through awareness-raising and education.     To achieve these aims, the programme must ensure that there is a real change in energy behaviour in the EU on the part of individuals as well as industry and enterprise. It must also develop instruments to ensure effective follow-up, monitoring and evaluation.      Fields of action      The programme is divided into four fields, some of which match the earlier programmes to provide and reinforce continuity:      Key actions      The programme is structured around key actions for each field of action and funding is directed towards measures or projects concerned with:      promotion of sustainable development, security of energy supply, competitiveness and environmental protection. Projects may include the development of standards and of labelling and certification systems and the monitoring of developments on the markets and energy trends;       creation, enlargement and promotion of structures and instruments for sustainable energy development, such as local and regional energy management, and the development of financial products;       promotion of systems and equipment in order to speed up market penetration by the best available technologies;       development of information, education and training structures to raise public awareness and dissemination of know-how and best practices;       monitoring of the implementation and impact of EU sustainable energy policy;       evaluation of the impact of projects funded under the programme.       Funding      The EU contribution may not exceed 50% of the cost of the measure; the rest may be covered by either public or private funds or by a combination of the two. However, certain exceptions are allowed: for example, the EU aid may cover the full cost of action to evaluate the impact of the measures and coordinate them more closely.     Indicative budgetary amounts are set for each specific field. The budgetary allocation is flexible in order to respond more fully to changing needs in the sector.      Implementation      The Commission, assisted by a committee, will be responsible for the implementation of the programme. It will set the objectives and guidelines, and be in charge of project selection, etc.     Implementation of the programme will require a big increase in staff because the programme covers a wider range than its predecessor. In the present situation, given the nature of the action planned, the Commission considers that one option for management of the programme would be to set up an agency to implement it, under the supervision of the Commission; the agency could perform certain tasks relating to management and monitoring of the programme, such as drawing up recommendations on implementation of the programme and managing some or all phases of the projects.      Participation      The programme is open to any legal, public or private person established in the territory of the EU, the candidate countries and the countries of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the European Economic Area (EEA).      Evaluation      The Commission will carry out an annual examination of progress on this programme. During the second year of application of the programme and before the Commission puts forward proposals on any subsequent programme, independent experts will carry out an external evaluation of the programme.      Background      The multiannual programme for action in the field of energy, "Intelligent Energy for Europe", implements the broad lines of action described in the Green Paper on the European Strategy for security of energy supply. This Green Paper aims at       strengthening the security of energy supply      , combating climate change and boosting the competitiveness of EU businesses.     The       Intelligent Energy for Europe"      programme, which is a specific sub-programme of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (2007-13), allows the 2003-06 Intelligent Energy programme to continue.

   Neighbourhood Policy: 2008 Report     Neighbourhood Policy: 2008 Report     The 2008 Report on the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) presents the reforms accomplished by European Union (EU) partner countries and the development of their cooperation actions. Despite slowdown, in particular due to global economic conditions, and political conflicts and challenges in certain neighbourhood countries, this progress demonstrates the necessity to strengthen the ENP.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council of 23 April 2009 - Implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy in 2008 [       COM(2009) 188      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     In 2008, relations between the European Union (EU) and countries covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) intensified. Progress in bilateral and multilateral cooperation demonstrates an increased interdependence between partners as well as the necessity of continuing to strengthen the ENP.     The main progress accomplished by the partner countries concerns trade agreements, the strengthening of political cooperation, public finance and customs duty, competition policy, the business environment and the fight against corruption. More efforts should be made to achieve democratic reforms and promote human rights.     However, 2008 was marked by an economic climate which was unfavourable to reforms. Several events destabilised the neighbourhood area: the conflict between Russia and Georgia in August 2008, the disruption of gas supplies between Ukraine and Russia, and the Israeli intervention in Gaza in December 2008/January 2009. The global financial crisis also affected all ENP partner countries.      Regional cooperation      The EU and its partners adopted new cooperation frameworks aimed at increasing the regional strand of the European Neighbourhood Policy.     The       Union for the Mediterranean      , launched at the Paris summit in July 2008, gives new impetus to Euro-Mediterranean relations. It should in particular lead to better sharing of responsibilities between partners and increase the visibility of their actions. Regional projects should be conducted in the following areas: the fight against maritime pollution, against natural and man-made disasters, the development of maritime and land links, renewable energies, and enterprises. The       Euro-Mediterranean University      was inaugurated in 2008 in Slovenia.     Following the Kiev meeting in 2008, the       Black Sea Synergy      entered its operational phase. Projects with a regional dimension should be launched in the fields of energy, transport, communications, trade, the environment, maritime policy, fisheries, migration, law enforcement and the fight against organised crime. Discussions are under way to move forward on the de-pollution of the Black Sea, maritime links and security, as well as the creation of a Common Aviation Area.     In 2008 the Commission proposed to establish an       Eastern Partnership      , in order to intensify its relations with Central European and South Caucasus countries. This framework should advance political and democratic reforms, the economic integration of the region, energy security and mobility.      Impact of the global financial crisis      The ENP contributes to strengthening trade links between the EU and its neighbours, and to pursuing their regional economic integration. The impact of the financial crisis has been different in the Southern and Eastern regions:      Eastern partners have been the most affected due to the reduced contribution of foreign capital that is indispensable for their growth, the vulnerability of their banking sector and the drop in export prices in some key sectors (metal, agriculture, trade);       Mediterranean partners were less affected by the credit crisis. Their economies were protected by low rates of debt, few needs for foreign capital, and the low regional integration of their financial sector.      Regarding economic sectors, tourism, construction and export industries are likely to be seriously affected given the fall in demand, particularly European demand, and increased competition from lower-wage countries. The crisis is likely to cause a reduction in investments, and an increase in youth unemployment and migratory flows.      Recommendations      In the current context, and in view of the necessity to make progress towards a liberalisation of trade, the ENP should:      hold regular dialogues, in order to meet the socio-economic needs of the most vulnerable countries and support their sustainable development.       increase macro-economic aid, by granting European loans which are coordinated with International Monetary Fund (IMF) stand-by arrangements;       strengthen the regulatory environment of the financial sector and the supervision of its activities, by widening the scope of existing technical assistance programmes;       encourage the EIB and EBRD to accelerate their lending operations;       support trade and investment, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).      The 2011-2013 programming of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) should take these priorities into account.     Last updated: 30.09.2009  
summary of   Directive 2001/51/EC supplementing Article 26 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement   what is the aim of the directive  This directive aims to combat illegal immigration by harmonising the financial penalties imposed by  European Union  (EU) countries on passenger carriers for transporting non-EU nationals who are not properly documented.   key points   It supplements Article 26 of the Convention implementing the  Schengen Agreement  which requires the carrier to assume responsibility for non-EU nationals it brings to the external border by air, sea or land. In line with Article 26 of the Convention, the carrier must take all the necessary measures to ensure that non-EU nationals carried by air or sea, and groups transported overland by coach, have the travel documents required for entry into the Schengen countries.  In line with the directive, a carrier that cannot carry out the return of a non-EU national is responsible for finding the means for his or her onward transportation. If this transportation cannot be carried out immediately, the carrier must assume responsibility for the costs of the stay and return of the non-EU national.  The directive also requires EU countries to impose dissuasive, effective and proportionate financial penalties against carriers in breach of their obligations to ensure that persons travelling to the Schengen area have the documents required for entry. The directive sets out:   the  maximum  amount of the penalties is not less than EUR 5,000 per person; or   the  minimum  amount of the penalties is not less than EUR 3,000 per person; or   the  maximum  amount of the penalty imposed  as a lump sum  for each infringement is not less than EUR 500,000, regardless of the number of persons.   These financial penalties do not apply to cases where the non-EU national is seeking international protection.  EU countries may in addition adopt different types of penalties, such as seizure of the vehicle or withdrawal of the operating licence.  Carriers against whom proceedings have been brought for failure to fulfil their obligations have the right to defence and appeal.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 9 August 2001.
   Port infrastructure: quality services in sea ports     Port infrastructure: quality services in sea ports     This Communication sets out a certain number of avenues that the Commission has noted with the aim of improving the quality of services in maritime ports.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and to the European Parliament of 13 February 2001: Reinforcing Quality Services in Sea Ports: a Key for European Transport [       COMM(2001) 35      - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY      The Commission's Green paper on seaports and maritime infrastructure      gave rise to a lively debate between the parties concerned and the European Institutions. 3 key issues resulted from this debate:      Integration of sea ports in the trans-European Transport Network       Systematic approach to regulate access to the market of port services       Public financing of sea ports and port infrastructures.       1 Seaports and Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T)       Decision No 1692/96/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 1996 on Community guidelines for the development of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) provides a broad framework for establishing an integral and multimodal infrastructure network. Sea ports obviously play an important role within such a network.     This is why the Commission has proposed, as far as sea ports in particular are concerned, internal navigation ports and intermodal terminals, the identification of, inter alia, some 300 seaports, using objective criteria, for inclusion in the outline plans and sought to improve the definition of relevant projects of common interest relating to sea ports.      2 Market Access to Port Services      "Port services" are services of a commercial nature that are provided, for payment, to port users. The price of these services is usually not included in the charges collected for being allowed to call at or operate in a port. Although the degree to which the market is open varies from one Member State to the next, and even between the ports of that same Member State, all Member States have opted for the progressive opening up of this sector to competition.     However, restricted market access for the provision of certain port services is justifiable for the following reasons: some ports can only offer limited space, tasks must be carried out under Community customs procedures, and they have a specific responsibility for maritime as well as on-shore safety and environmental protection.     The proposal for a Directive on market access to port services aims to establish more comprehensive rules regarding market access to port services through competition, in ports with international traffic, whilst taking on-shore safety and environmental protection requirements into consideration, public service obligations, and the diversity of the ports in question. This legislation is designed to provide a framework for the national measures which help to eliminate existing restrictions in the port services market whilst respecting the national, or indeed local, particularities, on grounds of subsidiarity.      3 Public financing and seaports      A key issue, from the competition point of view, is the division of the financial flows between the public authorities, the port operators and the users of port services.     Whilst in the past, the construction of ports and port services were expected to be paid for by the tax payer, a discernible trend has developed towards greater private participation in their financing. At the same time, more and more port management bodies are striving to develop a more active commercial role. In fact, some ports are operating on an entirely commercial basis.     Report on the public financing and charging practices in the Community Sea Port Sectors ("inventory")     The Commission has, with the active support of the Member States, gathered information in the form of an inventory on the public financing and charging practices in the Community sea port sector. The following conclusions should be kept in mind:      90% of the Community's maritime trade is estimated to be handled in ports where investments and other policy and managerial decisions e.g. charging, are dependent on or at least influenced by public bodies;       Public investment in ports represents between 5 and 10% of total Community investments in the transport infrastructure;       Public financing operations are not sufficiently transparent;       Charging and cost recovery systems vary greatly;       The port services market is developing and the possibilities of gaining access to it are increasing, although the procedural rules which should ensure fair and open selection procedures are unclear and unsatisfactory.      Transparency     The inventory shows that three accounting systems are used in port management. Analysis of these three systems shows that none are likely to provide clear and transparent information on public money flows in ports or on the use of funds by the port management body.     The consultations following the publication of the Green Paper have highlighted the faults of a system that hinders the Commission's ability to satisfactorily control, where warranted, state aid rules and generally risks impeding competition at a time when Member States and port authorities introduce more and more private initiative, competition and capital into ports.     As a result, the Commission believes that the implementation of Directive       2000/52/EC      of the Commission of 26 July 2000 modifying Directive       80/723/EEC      on the transparency of financial relations between the Member States and public undertakings (the "Directive on transparency"), combined with a legal requirement to keep separate accounts to be introduced as part of the proposed "Directive on market access to port services" will lead to considerable improvements.     State Aid to ports     The Commission has been requested to issue guidelines on port state aid for the construction of port infrastructures, as it has done in other sectors, but notably due to the lack of case law on this subject, the Commission prefers to carry out case-by-case examinations where the facts and specificities of each case alone determine the outcome.     According to Article 87 (1), the selection criteria for aid is the only benchmark for determining whether an investment measure constitutes as State aid or not, no matter whether it is categorised as financing for port infrastructure, superstructure, mobile asset or operational service.     Public (general)' infrastructure is open to all users on a non-discriminatory basis and the Commission regards investments in this type of infrastructure as general measures, provided that they are open to all users, be they actual or potential.     As regards "user specific" infrastructures, in general, if public authorities prepare land in their possession for development and sell or lease it at market rates, the Commission does not regard such investments in infrastructure as state aid.     Investments in superstructures can include all types of buildings (warehouses, workshops, offices) and all types of fixed or semi-mobile equipment, they often favour certain undertakings and thus constitute as aid, except for the exemptions provided for in the Treaty.     Public support to investments in mobile assets and operational services, e.g. those of individual port service providers, generally favours certain undertakings and thus constitutes as State aid, apart from the exemptions provided for in the Treaty.

   Satellite navigation: Galileo     Satellite navigation: Galileo     GALILEO is the European satellite radio navigation and positioning programme. Launched by the European Commission and developed jointly with the European Space Agency, it gives the European Union (EU) an independent technology to compete with the American GPS and Russian GLONASS systems. This communication marks the beginnings of Galileo and defines the issues at stake and the objectives of the programme.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 10 February 1999 - "Galileo - Involving Europe in a new generation of satellite navigation services" [       COM(1999) 54      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY      The issues at stake      In the field of satellite navigation, there are considerable and numerous issues at stake. There are currently two competing systems: the American GPS, which dominates the marketplace, and the Russian GLONASS.     The current dependence, especially on GPS, raises questions of a strategic nature, since the systems utilised are not under European control. The challenge is to safeguard European strategic needs, for example in the field of the common foreign and security policy, without risk or excessive cost.     Satellite navigation offers obvious advantages for managing transport. It allows for greater safety, better traffic flow, reduced congestion and environmental damage, and the support of multi-modal development. The current GPS and GLONASS systems do not seem to guarantee the reliability and availability necessary for passenger transport. The implementation of the European Galileo system will remedy these shortcomings.     The stakes are both economic and industrial. In particular, with a potential global market valued at EUR 40 thousand million between now and 2005, the challenge is to capture a fair share of the satellite navigation market as well as the jobs which flow on from it. The current estimates are as follows: the development of the Galileo infrastructure would generate 20 000 jobs, while its operation would create 2 000 permanent jobs, not including opportunities in the field of applications.     Finally, the regulatory aspects are also considerable. In practice, use of information systems based on positioning and timing signals could make it possible to monitor compliance with certain Community regulations in the area of fishing, for example, or environmental protection.     Even though the United States already has a head start, considering the stakes it is essential for Europe to make a decision quickly on its participation in the next generation of positioning, navigation and timing systems.      Strategic choices      The development of a GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) must be a concerted effort. In March 1998 the Council called on the Commission to explore the possibility of developing a common system with the United States. Discussions were held to clarify possible options. As the Americans were not prepared, for military reasons, to envisage joint ownership or an effective role for Europe in controlling the GPS system, cooperation would be possible:      either in the existing GPS system controlled by the United States;       or in the development of a GNSS based on two navigation systems using complementary interoperable satellites: GPS and Galileo.      The latter option was selected by the Commission, after rejecting the zero option consisting of consciously giving up all European participation in the core space segment of the future GNSS.     The Commission considers it equally desirable for Galileo to be opened to other partners, with whom contact has already been made, such as:      the Russian Federation: the GLONASS system could be progressively integrated with Galileo;       Japan, which could contribute, particularly financially, to the development of Galileo;       other countries or regions (CEEC, EFTA, Turkey, etc.) to which Europe will have to promote its approach favouring GNSS.      In short, Galileo would have to harness the potential for application of a satellite navigation system to civilian uses by striving to fill the gaps in the GPS and reinforcing the reliability of GNSS. It would have to provide global coverage immediately.      Requirements and technical characteristics      The system must be designed to assure global coverage and to allow mass-market public application, with a good level of safety for European transport and minimum space infrastructure. On the other hand, Galileo must provide at least horizontal accuracy of less than 10 metres.     In terms of security, the system will have to guarantee the physical protection of vital infrastructure and provide accurate signals in times of crisis or war. Care must be taken to make any signal rerouting or access to the system by the enemy in times of war completely impossible. To meet these security requirements, experts advocate the installation of controlled access.      Financial aspects      The total cost of Galileo for the period 1999-2008 is estimated at between EUR 2.2 thousand million and 2.95 thousand million, depending on the extent of cooperation with the United States and the use of terrestrial systems.     Current American policy is to provide the GPS base signal free of charge. This type of approach to Galileo would require heavy public financing, as the private sector alone cannot bear this kind of cost with a view to providing a free service for users.     As Galileo is considered a key element in the trans-European network and common transport policy, European financing is justified. This will be possible from the European Union budget, in particular the TEN budget, that of the European Space Agency and the fifth R&D Framework Programme. In addition, specific revenue streams could be established by means of regulatory arrangements such as installing certain controlled-access subscriber-only services, or taxing signal receivers. In short, the development of a public-private partnership should be encouraged.      Organisational framework      In order to design, build and operate Galileo, the Commission proposes an organisational structure bringing in, amongst others, the GNSS high-level group, the Commission, the European Space Agency and all investors. A small special management board could be set up.     Nevertheless, above all, a political commitment is indispensable in order to provide the necessary impetus for investment by industry, for negotiating the features of the system with international partners and for reinforcing European influence in this strategic domain. The European Council could lead the way in this respect.      Background      Following an initial communication in January 1998, in March 1998 the Council called on the Commission to present recommendations on the European approach to global satellite navigation. This communication is the response to the Council's request. It was followed in 2002 by the creation of the       Galileo joint undertaking      and then the       regulation on the deployment and commercial operating phases      of the programme.     RELATED ACTS      Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council of 14 July 2004 on the implementation of the deployment and commercial operating phases of the European programme of satellite radionavigation [         COM(2004) 477        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      The Galileo programme has now reached an advanced stage of maturity and goes well beyond the framework of a simple research project. This regulation aims to base the programme on a specific legal instrument, which is more appropriate for meeting its industrial and commercial needs and best meets the requirements of sound financial management.      Council Regulation (EC) No         876/2002        of 21 May 2002 setting up the Galileo Joint Undertaking.      This Regulation sets up the joint undertaking to manage the development phase (2002-2005) of the GALILEO programme. Besides managing the development phase until 2005, this joint undertaking must also prepare the implementation of the later phases of the programme (deployment and commercial operation).      Council resolution of 3 August 1999 [Official Journal C 221 of 3 August 1999].      On 19 July 1999 the Council adopted a resolution on "Involving Europe in a new generation of satellite navigation services - Galileo - Definition phase", in which it called on the Commission to submit draft mandates to the Council for negotiations in order to explore fully possibilities for cooperation with the United States of America and the Russian Federation. It also called on the Commission to present a thorough cost-benefit analysis examining, in particular, options for revenue sources, the proposed public-private partnership and the possibilities for securing finance from the private sector.

   Education and training in the nuclear energy field     Education and training in the nuclear energy field     Nuclear energy is currently the subject of debate on the national and international stage, following the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in March 2011. It appears essential to have experienced staff who are able to use nuclear energy responsibly and to conduct nuclear waste management and the decommissioning of power plants. This Communication therefore proposes a number of training avenues designed to strengthen the competence of staff in this sector, and to ensure that no nuclear accidents such as that at Fukushima occur in future.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council of 16 September 2011 – 1st situation report on education and training in the nuclear energy field in the European Union [       COM(2011) 563      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This Communication reports on the current situation with regard to staff training in the nuclear sector. It proposes several avenues in order to ensure that the European Union (EU) has a sufficient number of well-trained staff to use nuclear energy responsibly.      Present situation in the nuclear sector as to human resources      In 2008, the European Commission launched and published a study entitled       Nuclear Safety in a Situation of Fading Nuclear Experience      with the aim of analysing the availability of nuclear safety staff. This study revealed a situation of concern for the period to 2020, which may be explained by the following facts:      the number of students and graduates with a strong background in nuclear sciences is insufficient;       the nuclear sector does not attract university graduates;       continuing education for nuclear sector staff is not ensured.      The study has demonstrated the need for:      a regular supply and demand analysis at EU level concerning the qualitative and quantitative needs for new staff;       continuous monitoring of the challenges identified.       Proposed initiatives      It appears necessary for the Commission to       enhance university studies in nuclear sciences and techniques      . The European Nuclear Education Network (ENEN) Association, created in 2003, has a role to play. Composed of 60 universities, it endeavours to ensure the free movement of nuclear knowledge.     The Commission also wishes to introduce       incentives      for graduates to take up jobs in the nuclear sector. In January 2010, the       European Nuclear Energy Leadership Academy      (ENELA) was established by the following European companies:       AREVA        ;        Axpo        ;        EnBW        ;        E.ON Kernkraft        ;        URENCO        ;        Vattenfal        .      The purpose of the ENELA is to provide young science graduates, or managers with experience, with the skills and expertise they will need to become future leaders in the field of nuclear energy.     It is also vital to develop       post-graduate and professional training      , and to improve expertise and mobility. This Communication identifies three types of initiative aimed at achieving this target:       EU initiatives        : the Commission wishes to create "European Skill Passports" to integrate the requirements of mobility and lifelong learning. In the nuclear sector as well, it is appropriate to use the         European Credit system for Vocational Education and Training        (ECVET), and the Euratom or ENEN training programmes. The         Instrument for Nuclear Safety Cooperation        (ICSN) can also help to increase the technical knowledge and capabilities of non-EU countries, as can the Sustainable Nuclear Energy Technology Platform (         SNE-TP        ).        International initiatives:        The ENEN is a member of the         World Nuclear University        (WNU), whose purpose is to enhance education and leadership in nuclear science and technology. In addition, the International Atomic Energy Agency (         IAEA        ) is highly active in disseminating information in the nuclear field. It supports the International School of Nuclear Law, established in 2001 by the         OECD/NEA        , which offers an intensive course in international nuclear law.        National initiatives:        a number of Member States (including Belgium, Denmark, France and Romania) have established national nuclear education networks and post-graduate programmes.      Since 2009, the European Human Resource Observatory in the Nuclear Energy Sector (EHRO-N) has monitored the situation and provided human resources data.

   Biodiversity Action Plan for Fisheries     Biodiversity Action Plan for Fisheries     1) OBJECTIVE     Establishing an action plan to improve or maintain biodiversity status and preventing biodiversity loss due to fisheries and aquaculture activities.     2) COMMUNITY MEASURE     Commission Communication of 27 March 2001 to the Council and the European Parliament: Biodiversity Action Plan for Fisheries (Volume IV).     3) CONTENTS     This communication is the fourth volume of the Commission Communication of 27 March 2001 on Biodiversity Action Plans in the areas of Conservation of Natural Resources, Agriculture, Fisheries, and Development and Economic Cooperation. This volume is specifically dedicated to fisheries.      Introduction      In recent decades, the rate of decline and even disappearance of species and related habitats, ecosystems and genes (i.e. biodiversity) has increased throughout the world. This loss of biodiversity is deplorable in itself and has adverse effects on economic development since it is the basis for the food, fibres, drink, medicines, industrial processes, agriculture and fisheries activities we rely on for our survival.     In February 1998, the Commission adopted a communication on a       Community Biodiversity Strategy      . This strategy already provided for special action plans for the areas of activity concerned to be set up and implemented. This communication sets out the Action Plans in the areas of Conservation of Natural Resources, Agriculture, Fisheries, and Development and Economic Cooperation.     The Community Biodiversity Strategy and the Action Plans are covered by the European Union commitment to achieve sustainable development and integrate environmental concerns into other sectoral policies and other policy areas.     Indicators will be used for the long-term monitoring and benchmarking of Action Plan implementation. These indicators, which still have to be specified by the Commission with the help of the Member States, scientists and organisations concerned, will be measured locally and results compared.     The       European Community clearing house mechanism      (EC CHM) is an invaluable resource for exchanging information on biodiversity which should be supported and developed further.     The Commission is currently identifying biodiversity conservation research needs so as to include them in the Sixth European Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development.     The Commission plans to set up a Committee of Experts on Biodiversity which would disseminate information and strive to ensure that European and national measures were complementary. Representatives of NGOs, industry, associations and any other interested parties would be invited to attend committee meetings as observers.     Although the actual impact of fisheries on biodiversity has not been fully identified, the Commission Communication of 14 July 1999 on Fisheries Management and Nature Conservation in the Marine Environment [       COM (1999) 363      ] highlights the interactions between fishing and the environment and puts forward a strategic European framework for the sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources and biodiversity.      Priorities      The plan identified the following priorities to maintain or restore biodiversity threatened by fishing or aquaculture activities:      promoting the conservation and sustainable use of fish stocks;       promoting the control of exploitation rates and the establishment of technical conservation measures to support the conservation and sustainable use of fish stocks;       reducing the impact of fisheries activities on non-target species and on marine and coastal ecosystems;       avoiding aquaculture practices that may affect habitat conservation.      This Action Plan should lead to the application of the precautionary principle as set out in the Commission Communication of December 2000 on the application of the precautionary principle and multiannual arrangements for setting TACs [       COM(2000)803      ].     The communication proposes measures to reduce fisheries activities, technical measures and measures to intensify research and monitoring.     In the field of aquaculture, the communication proposes measures to reduce its environmental impact, to limit the introduction of alien invasive species, to protect animal health and promote further research.      Additional key elements      Education, training, raising awareness and providing information are essential complements to the effective implementation of this action plan. The communication proposes:      information campaigns and other awareness-raising activities;       a communication on applying the precautionary principle in fisheries management;       vocational training to improve ecosystem management;       improving monitoring and assessment capabilities.      The development of the new common fisheries policy for 2002 offers an excellent opportunity to review the issues raised by this plan, and to introduce new measures or enhance existing measures.

summary of   Regulation (Euratom) No 302/2005 on the application of Euratom safeguards   what is the aim of the regulation  The regulation reviews and sets out revised rules safeguarding nuclear materials, especially in light of the EU's enlargement and developments in nuclear and information technology. These rules aim to guarantee that nuclear materials are not diverted to purposes other than those for which they were originally declared.   key points    Scope   The regulation applies to any person or business setting up or operating an installation for the production, separation, reprocessing, storage or other use of source material or special fissile material. It does not apply to issues arising from end products used for non-nuclear purposes.  The regulation repeals Commission Regulation (Euratom) No  3227/76  , Commission Regulation (Euratom) No  220/90  and Commission Regulation (Euratom) No  2130/93  .   Declaration of technical characteristics   In response to Additional Protocol  1999/188/Euratom  , the basic technical characteristics of new installations must be communicated to the  European Commission  at least 200 days before the first consignment of nuclear material is due to be received, based on the questionnaire in Annex I.  For every new installation with an inventory or annual throughput of an ‘effective kilogramme’ (equivalent to a kilo of plutonium), the declaration must include information on the owner, operator, purpose, location, type, capacity and expected commissioning date, to be submitted at least 200 days before construction begins. Information on any modifications must be supplied within 30 days of the modifications being completed.   Programme of activities   The Commission must be kept informed of the annual programme of activities concerning operations, arrivals of materials and waste-processing, and operators must give at least 40 days before taking a physical inventory.   Nuclear safeguards   Users of nuclear material must keep a system of records and to make declarations about the nuclear material they hold and process to the European Commission.  The Commission verifies these declarations for correctness and completeness to re-assure citizens, supplier states, and the international community that the nuclear material is used only for peaceful purposes.  The nuclear safeguarding rules include:   material balance areas and the selection of key measurement points (these are methods used to determine the flow and stocks of nuclear materials);   changes in basic technical characteristics which require advance notice;   procedures for keeping records of nuclear materials and drawing up reports;   procedures for taking physical inventories for accounting purposes as part of safeguarding;   agreed containment and surveillance;   arrangements for taking samples for safeguard purposes.    Accounting for nuclear materials   A system of accounting for nuclear materials stored or used at an installation must be established to ensure close supervision. Recommendation  2009/120/Euratom  describes the reference characteristics of an operator’s nuclear material accountancy and control (NMAC) system. Those responsible for installations must submit regular reports to the Commission, including accounting reports, material balance reports describing changes in materials, inventory change reports and an annual summary of physical inventories.   Reporting and verification   Users and holders of nuclear material (uranium, plutonium, and thorium) in the EU have to keep records documenting flows, processes, and stocks. Every month they must declare all flows of nuclear materials in and out of their installation to the European Commission. Once a year they must inventory all stocks of nuclear material they hold.   Transfers between EU countries   Operators must give advance notification to the Commission if any source materials or special fissile materials (at least one effective kilogram, and excluding materials found in waste) are:   exported to, or imported from, a non-EU country;   shipped between a non-nuclear-weapon EU country and a nuclear-weapon EU country (i.e. the United Kingdom or France).    Waste   The Commission must receive advance notification of most operations concerning the treatment of waste, including the location of conditioned waste (embedded in cement) containing certain nuclear materials such as highly enriched uranium.   EU countries with nuclear weapons (France and the United Kingdom)   The regulation does not apply to installations or nuclear materials which have been assigned to meet defence needs in these two EU countries.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 20 March 2005. Amendments relating to Croatia joining the EU have applied since 1 July 2013.   background   The  Euratom Treaty  Articles  77  ,  78  ,  79  and  81  (in Chapter 7 of the Treaty) deal with nuclear safeguards.

act   Council Directive  2003/48/EC  of 3 June 2003 on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments.   summary   As part of the tax package aimed at combating harmful tax competition, the EU adopted a Directive in 2003 to reduce existing distortions in the effective taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments.  The aim of the Directive is to enable this interest paid in one EU country to individual residents for tax purposes in another country (beneficial owners), to be made subject to effective taxation in accordance with the laws of the country.   Scope   The scope of this Directive is limited to taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments on debt claims, to the exclusion of the issues relating to the taxation of pension and insurance benefits. At territorial level, the Directive applies to interest paid by a paying agent, i.e. an economic operator (for example, a financial institution, a bank or an investment fund) which pays interest or secures their payment to beneficial owners, established in the territory of the EU. Any such entity established in an EU country to which interest has been paid or secured for the benefit of the beneficial owner is considered a paying agent within the meaning of the Directive. This way the paying agent is the last link in the chain of intermediaries that pays interest directly to the beneficial owner.   the general systemexchange of information    Information reporting by the paying agent   Where the beneficial owner is resident in an EU country other than that in which the paying agent is established, the Directive stipulates that the latter must report to the competent authority of the EU country of establishment a minimum amount of information, such as the identity and residence of the beneficial owner, the name and address of the paying agent, the account number of the beneficial owner or, where there is none, identification of the debt claim giving rise to the interest, and information concerning the interest payment.  The minimum amount of information to be transmitted by the paying agent must distinguish between the types of interest listed in the Directive. However, EU countries may restrict the minimum amount of information, for example, to the total amount of interest or income.   Automatic exchange of information   Under the Directive, the competent authority of the EU country of the paying agent must communicate, at least once a year, to the competent authority of the EU country of residence of the beneficial owner. This communication must occur within the six months following the end of the tax year of the EU country of the paying agent.   the new rules applicable from 1.1.2016   It appeared that certain financial instruments equivalent to interest-bearing securities and certain indirect means of holding these securities were not covered by the Directive 2003/48/EC. Consequently, a new Directive has been adopted, the Directive  2014/48/EU  which will have to be transposed in the EU countries by 1.1.2016 in order to remedy this situation.  The aim of the Directive is to:   reinforce the existing rules regarding the exchange of information on savings income for the purpose of enabling EU countries to combat fraud and tax evasion better;   promote a transparent approach based on the obligation to customer due diligence which prevents individuals from circumventing the Directive by using an interposed legal entity (for example, a foundation) or arrangement (for example, a trust) located in  a country outside the EU  which does not ensure the effective taxation of this legal entity/arrangement on all of its income from financial products covered by the Directive;   to improve the rules aimed at preventing individuals from circumventing the Directive by using an interposed legal entity (a foundation) or arrangement (a trust) located  in an EU country  . These rules imply notification by this legal entity or arrangement;   to extend the scope of the Directive to include financial products which present characteristics similar to receivables (for example, securities with a fixed/guaranteed rate of return and certain life insurance products), but which are not legally classified as such;   to take into account all income from investment funds received within and outside of the EU in addition to income from undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities authorised in accordance with the Directive  85/611/EEC  (  UCITS  ) which are already contained in the current Directive.

act   Council Directive  2013/59/Euratom  of 5 December 2013 laying down basic safety standards for protection against the dangers arising from exposure to ionising radiation, and repealing Directives 89/618/Euratom, 90/641/Euratom, 96/29/Euratom, 97/43/Euratom and 2003/122/Euratom.   summary   Normally, doses of ionising radiation are so low that there are no adverse health effects, however some, notably cancer, can appear at a later date. To minimise the danger, a European Union directive, adopted in December 2013, introduces new safety standards.  These draw on almost two decades of international research on radioprotection by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the World Health Organisation, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and other international bodies. They represent a significant advance in radioprotection in a wide range of areas: medical, industrial, power generation and waste management.   Aim   The legislation is designed to  protect the health  of  workers  , the  general public  ,  patients  and other individuals by guaranteeing a  uniform threshold level of protection  . This applies to any planned, existing, accidental or emergency exposure which might arise. EU governments may apply higher basic standards if they wish.   Publication of maximum doses or in the event of emergency   The directive provides for the publication of maximum radiation doses so that the public can check whether they have received, from various sources, more than the legal limit. There are also provisions for providing information when an  emergency  occurs. This must cover weather data and forecasts, air movements and ground deposits, ambient dose rates and contamination levels of essential foods.  National authorities have to inform anyone living  within 50 kilometres of a plant at risk  , and who could be affected, of the health protection measures they should take in the event of any emergency.   Disposal   The directive contains measures for the disposal of radioactive material and temporary, or final, storage of radioactive waste, and the exposure of workers to cosmic radiation from aircraft, spacecraft and frequent flying.   Exemption   Ionising radiation from  medical equipment  is not covered by the legislation, but by the medical devices directive (Directive  93/42/EEC  ).   Repeal   Directives 89/618/Euratom, 90/641/Euratom, 96/29/Euratom, 97/43/Euratom and 2003/122/Euratom will be repealed with effect from 6 February 2018.

summary of    Regulation (EC) No 1099/2008 on EU energy statistics   what is the aim of the regulation   It sets up a system to produce EU-wide statistics on energy products  *  and their aggregates  *  .   It also applies to  European Economic Area  countries.   It covers the entire process of collecting, transmitting, evaluating and disseminating the data.   key points    Terminology   Technical terms are defined and clarified in the regulation’s Annex A.   Data sources   EU countries are required to compile statistics concerning energy products and their aggregates from the following sources:    specific surveys  addressed to the primary  *  and transformed  *  energy producers and traders, distributors and transporters, importers and exporters of energy products;    other surveys  addressed to final energy users in the sectors of manufacturing industry, transport, and other sectors, including households;   other  estimation procedures  or other sources, including administrative sources, such as regulators of the electricity and gas markets.    Transmission and dissemination of data   Reporting countries must transmit national statistics to the  European Commission  (  Eurostat  ) as laid down in the regulation’s annexes:    annually  for energy statistics in Annex B;    monthly  for energy statistics in Annex C (data must be transmitted to Eurostat within 55 days following the reported month);    short-term monthly  for the energy statistics in Annex D (data must be transmitted to Eurostat within one calendar month of the month reported).   The transmission arrangements, including the applicable time limits, and any exceptions and exemptions are set out in the annexes. Over time, these arrangements may be modified by the Commission.  Eurostat must disseminate annual statistics no later than 31 January of the second year after the reported period.   Quality assessment and reports   EU countries are responsible for the quality of the data they transmit to Eurostat. In particular, they must ensure that energy data they declare under this regulation matches data they declare with regard to the  EU Monitoring Mechanism Regulation  .  The Commission (Eurostat) assesses the quality of data from several perspectives including their relevance, punctuality, accessibility, clarity and comparability.  Every 5 years, EU countries must provide Eurostat with a report on the quality of the data transmitted, as well as on any changes in methodology that have been made.   Annual nuclear statistics   As of 2009, EU countries have been preparing statistics on the nuclear sector. The set of statistics collected concerns the civil use of nuclear energy.   Renewable energy and final energy consumption statistics   To ensure better quality and more comprehensive renewable energy and final energy consumption statistics, the Commission, with the EU countries, is reviewing and revising the methodologies used in their production.

   Green Paper on the learning mobility of young people     Green Paper on the learning mobility of young people     This green paper launches a public consultation with the aim of boosting mobility opportunities for young people.     ACT     Green Paper of 8 July 2009 – Promoting the learning mobility of young people [       COM(2009) 329      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Transnational mobility through which young people may acquire new knowledge and skills (learning mobility) enhances personal development and employability. Currently however, the learning mobility of young people is more an exception than a rule, and should therefore be promoted in all disciplines and contexts. As a result, the Commission is launching this public consultation to initiate discussions on how existing and new instruments, as well as public authorities and stakeholders can be mobilised to that end.     The green paper presents a number of issues where further efforts towards learning mobility are needed. The aim is to promote organised mobility that is carried out across borders as well as within and across sectors. While the value of virtual mobility is recognised, the focus is on physical mobility and the challenges arising before, during and after such periods.      Preparing for a period of learning mobility      Preparation is an essential element of any mobility project and needs to be well thought-out in order for the mobility period to be a success. Firstly, this consists of providing good quality and easily accessible       information and guidance      on mobility opportunities, including on funding, education and training programmes, as well as on any practical issues. Secondly, there is a need to       promote and motivate      young people to be mobile by informing them of the benefits and guaranteeing the recognition of such an experience. Thirdly,       linguistic skills and intercultural competences      facilitate mobility, and may be upgraded during mobility periods. However, as a lack of such skills may be a barrier to participation, ways to address these obstacles must be explored.     Other challenges to take into consideration during the preparatory phase include the       legal status      of the young people in the host countries. A secure framework for the mobility of minors and a European Trainee Statute for the mobility of trainees could help to overcome such legal obstacles. Similarly, the obstacles to the       portability of grants and loans      as well as to the access to benefits, which often contravene Community law, should be overcome to promote mobility. To this end, the Commission is suggesting the publication of guides for Member State authorities and stakeholders.     There is also a need to assure that the mobility period is of a high       quality      , to which both the sending and receiving institutions should commit. Appropriate mechanisms should be set up for selecting participants in a fair and transparent manner, as well as for matching participants and receiving institutions. A number of charters, such as the       European Quality Charter for Mobility      , could be used to guide this work, as could learning/training agreements drawn up by the sending and hosting institutions together with the participants. Finally, measures should be taken to       reach disadvantaged groups      , so that they may also benefit from the opportunities of learning mobility.      The stay abroad and follow-up      Proper arrangements should be in place to receive young people during their mobility periods abroad. It is particularly essential that the hosting institutions provide       mentoring      support to young people in order to help them integrate better into the host environment. Concerning the follow-up, mobility periods must be appropriately       recognised and validated      in terms of both formal and non-formal learning. To this end, a number of European instruments are already available (such as       ECVET      ,       EQF      ,       Europass      ), but greater use should be made of them at the regional and sectoral levels.      A new partnership for mobility      In order to overcome the continuing obstacles to mobility, it is imperative to       mobilise actors and resources      at all levels. A new partnership should be established between public authorities, civil society and partners from the       business world      . At the same time, the funding base needs to be enlarged to provide mobility opportunities to all groups of young people.      Virtual mobility      can provide an added value by acting as a catalyst for physical mobility, as well as by providing an international dimension to learning for those who cannot or do not want to go abroad.       “Multipliers”      , such as teachers and trainers at all levels, youth workers, as well as people who have been mobile are important in motivating young people to embark on a period of mobility. Any obstacles to their involvement in promoting mobility should be removed and opportunities for their mobility encouraged.     At the moment, mobility has wide backing. However, it is essential to turn this support into concrete       targets      , based on which Member States, regional authorities, institutions and organisations may define their mobility strategies. Strategic benchmarks should also be established to complement those developed at European and national levels.      Background      The Commission invites stakeholders and the wider public to respond to the issues raised in this green paper before 15 December 2009. The Commission will propose follow-up actions on the basis of these responses.

   Strategy on climate change for 2020 and beyond     Strategy on climate change for 2020 and beyond     The Commission assesses the costs and benefits of combating climate change and recommends a package of measures to limit global warming to 2° Celsius. Some of the measures apply to the EU, such as the binding target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and measures on energy, and others have a broader international scope, such as negotiating an international agreement.     ACT     Communication from the Commission, of 10 January 2007, entitled: "Limiting Global Climate Change to 2 degrees Celsius - The way ahead for 2020 and beyond" [       COM(2007) 2      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Strong scientific evidence shows that urgent action to tackle climate change is imperative. New research has confirmed that the climate really is changing and there are signs that these changes have accelerated. Impact analyses are beginning to quantify precisely what the cost of inaction or of simply pursuing current policies will be.     In 2005, the Commission laid the foundations for an EU strategy to combat climate change. This document now sets out more concrete steps to limit the effects of climate change and to reduce the risk of massive and irreversible disruptions to the planet. These short-term and medium-term measures target both developed countries (the EU and other industrialised countries) and developing countries.     The EU and its Member States have confirmed their target to limit the global average temperature increase to 2° Celsius compared with pre-industrial levels, the point beyond which the impact of climatic change is believed to increase dramatically. Research shows that stabilising the level of greenhouse gases at 450 ppmv (parts per million volume of CO2 equivalent) would lead to a 1 in 2 chance of reaching the target of a 2°C rise (compared with a 1 in 6 chance if levels reach 550 ppmv, and a 1 in 16 chance if levels hit 650 ppmv).      Costs and benefits of future policy choices      Recent research, such as the PESETA study carried out for the Joint Research Centre and the Stern Review, points out the hefty economic and social costs of failing to take sufficient action to combat climate change. The Stern Review estimates this cost at between 5 and 20 % of global DGP.     Climate change will cause widespread damage to populations, ecosystems and resources, as well as to infrastructure and living conditions, ranging from an increase in mortality and disease linked to changes in temperature, damage caused by more frequent flooding and a rise in sea level, increasing desertification in Southern countries and scarcer fresh water resources. The PESETA study focuses in particular on the impacts in Europe on agriculture, public health, tourism, river basins and coastal systems.     According to the impact assessment carried out by the Commission, the investment needed to maintain the level of greenhouse gases at 450 ppmv would cost about 0.5 % of global GDP over the period 2013-2030. Global GDP growth would only fall by 0.19 % per year up to 2030, a fraction of the expected annual GDP growth rate (2.8 %). The Commission also stresses that the global cost needed is overstated, since it does not account for the benefits of combating climate change.     Effectively tackling climate change would in fact produce significant benefits, including fewer damages by avoiding problems. In the same way, reducing our consumption of fossil fuels (especially oil and gas) will help cut costs in importing these resources and substantially improve the security of energy supply. Similarly, reducing CO2 emissions will help improve air quality, which will produce huge health benefits. What's more, most studies show that mitigation policies would have positive effects on employment, for example in the field of renewable energy and cutting-edge technology.     The benefits of combating climate change will not stop at EU borders. Similar benefits can be expected in other countries if they adopt similar measures to Europe, especially regarding the security of energy supply and air quality.      Action in the EU      The EU has already proved, through internal policies, that is possible to reduce greenhouse gas emissions without undermining economic growth. The Commission stresses that there is the potential to further reduce emissions considerably and echoes its commitment to pursue and extend current measures and to adopt new measures.     The Commission suggests that the EU should adopt targets to       reduce greenhouse gas emissions      . It calls for the EU to set the target in international negotiations of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in developed countries by 30 % (compared to 1990 levels) by 2020. Until an international agreement is made, and without prejudice to the position it will take in these negotiations, the EU should immediately make the resolute and independent commitment to reduce its own emissions by at least 20 % by 2020. At the March 2007 European Council, Member States also strongly backed these targets.     In line with the strategic analysis of the EU's energy policy, the Commission recommends taking the       following measures on energy      :      improving the EU's         energy efficiency        by 20 % by 2020;       increasing the share of         renewable energy        to 20 % by 2020;       developing an environmentally safe         carbon geological storage        policy.      The Commission believes that the       European Union Emissions Trading Scheme      (EU ETS) needs to be strengthened by taking measures such as the following:      increasing the duration of quota allocations to over five years, as it is now;       extending the scheme to other gases and sectors;       aligning allocation procedures across Member States and       linking the EU ETS to compatible mandatory schemes in other States (such as California and Australia).      In order to limit emissions in the       transport      sector, the Commission asks the Council and Parliament to adopt, where necessary, proposals to include aviation in the EU ETS and to link taxes on tourism vehicles to their CO2 emissions. There are also plans to       reduce CO2 emissions from cars      to reach the target of 120 grams of CO2 per kilometre (g CO2/km). The Commission also stresses the need for consumers to do more, to cut the emissions produced by freight transport by road and maritime transport and to address       biofuels      .     The document suggests cutting CO2 emissions in       other sectors      , such as by improving the       energy efficiency of residential and commercial buildings      . It also recommends reducing       other gases      , notably by adopting and strengthening measures on agriculture and       forestry      , setting limits for methane emissions from industry and gas engines and including these sources of emissions in the EU ETS, stricter measures on       fluorinated greenhouse gases      and tackling nitrous oxide from combustion and large installations.     It is also important to rapidly mobilise funds for       research      on the environment, energy and transport under the       Seventh Framework Programme      and to increase the research budget after 2013 to promote the development of clean technology and increase our knowledge of climate change. The action plans on energy technology and       environmental technology      must be fully implemented.     The document also notes that the strategic guidelines on       cohesion      should be applied, which promote sustainable transport and energy and environmental technologies.      International Action      The battle against climate change can only be won through global action. International negotiations must move beyond rhetoric towards negotiations on concrete commitments.     The Commission believes that       developed countries      must commit to cutting their greenhouse gas emissions by 30 % compared to 1990 levels by 2020, as part of a post-2012 international agreement. Developed countries also have the technological and financial capacity to reduce their emissions, which is why they should make most of the effort over the next decade. Emissions trading schemes will be a key tool to ensure that developed countries can reach their targets cost-effectively.     The growth in       developing countries      ' economies and emissions makes it essential for them to start reducing the rise in their emissions as soon as possible and to cut their emissions in absolute terms after 2020, since by 2020, these countries will be responsible for over half the greenhouse gas emissions.     Many developing countries are already making efforts that result in significant reductions in the growth of their greenhouse gas emissions, through policies addressing economic, security or local environmental concerns. Developing countries have many strategic options where the benefits outweigh the costs, such as improving energy efficiency, promoting renewable energy, adopting measures on air quality and recovery of methane from sources such as waste.     The following elements should be part of the process to step up action in these countries:      streamlining and expanding the clean development mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol to cover entire national sectors;       improving access to finance via a combination of the various mechanisms available so that developing countries can build the facilities to generate the cleanest energy possible;       introducing emissions trading schemes for certain industrial sectors where the capacity exists to properly monitor emissions;       countries that reach a level of development similar to that of developed countries should make a quantified, appropriate commitment;       no commitments for least developed countries.      Lastly, a future international agreement should address issues such as further cooperation in research and technology development, halting deforestation and restoring forested areas, adapting to the inescapable impacts of climate change and concluding an international agreement on energy efficiency standards.      Background      This communication follows up on the       2005 communication laying the basis for a future climate change strategy      . The measures proposed in this strategy are closely linked to the "Energy package" published by the Commission in January 2007, which defines a new European energy policy and sets out clear, quantified targets.     According to scientific research, the currents levels of CO2 and methane in the atmosphere are the highest they have been for 650 000 years, which causes a significant acceleration of the greenhouse effect. To stabilise global warming at an average of 2° Celsius, global emissions must fall by almost 50 % compared to 1990 levels by 2050, which implies a 60 to 80 % reduction by most developed countries by 2050 and a gradual but significant effort made by developing countries.     RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission of 9 March 2010 - International climate policy post-Copenhagen: Acting now to reinvigorate global action on climate change [         COM(2010) 86        final – Not published in the Official Journal].

summary of   Directive (EU) 2018/1972 establishing the European Electronic Communications Code   what is the aim of the directive  The directive:   establishes a set of updated rules to regulate electronic communications (telecoms) networks, telecoms services, and associated facilities and services;   sets out tasks for national regulatory authorities and other competent authorities, and establishes a set of procedures to ensure that the regulatory framework is harmonised throughout the EU;   aims to stimulate competition and increased investment in  5G   *  and very high capacity networks, so that every citizen and business in the EU can enjoy high quality connectivity, a high level of consumer protection and an increased choice of innovative digital services.   key points    The directive establishes a  European Electronic Communications Code  , a comprehensive set of new or revised rules for the telecoms sector as part of a package of  telecom laws  , including Regulation (EU) 2018/1971 establishing the  Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC)  and the Agency for Support for BEREC (BEREC Office).   It replaces and repeals Directives  2002/19/EC  ,  2002/20/EC  and  2002/21/EC  , as well as Article 5 of Decision No  243/2012/EU  . The review of Directive  2002/58/EC  (  Directive on privacy and electronic communications  ) is carried out separately.    General objectives     promote connectivity  and take-up of very high capacity networks, including fixed, mobile and wireless networks, for all EU citizens and businesses;   promote the interests of EU citizens by   enabling maximum benefits in terms of choice, price and quality through  effective competition    maintaining  network and services security    ensuring  protection for consumers  through specific rules and   addressing the  needs of specific social groups  , in particular people with disabilities, older people and people with special social needs;     facilitate market entry and  promote competition  in the delivery of telecoms networks and associated facilities;    contribute to the development of the internal market  in telecoms networks and services in the EU, by  developing common rules and predictable regulation  featuring:   the effective, efficient and coordinated use of  radio spectrum  ;    open innovation  ;   the development of  trans-European networks  ;   the  availability and interoperability of Europe-wide services  ; and    end-to-end connectivity  .      Responsibility of EU countries     cooperate  with each other and with the  European Commission  in the strategic planning and coordination of radio spectrum policy, avoiding harmful interference, through the  Radio Spectrum Policy Group  ;   ensure that tasks set out in the directive are undertaken by a  competent authority  ;   guarantee that national regulatory authorities and other competent authorities are  independent  of telecoms equipment manufacturers and service providers;   ensure that the national regulatory authorities   are protected against external intervention or political pressure which mightjeopardise their independent assessment and   have budget autonomy and adequate financial and human resources to carry out the tasks assigned to them.      New objectives and tasks   In addition to replacing and repealing existing legislation, the directive introduces a series of new objectives and tasks:    Strengthened consumer rules  aim to make it easier to switch between service providers and offer better protection, for example, for people who subscribe to bundled services. Consumers will benefit from a similar, higher level of protection across the EU.   Telecoms services now include  services provided over the internet  which do not use calling numbers, such as messaging apps and email. A review mechanism aims to ensure that consumerrights remain robust and up-to-date as business models and consumer behaviour change.    Affordable and adequate broadband internet access  must be available to all consumers, irrespective of their location or income.    People with disabilities  should have equivalent access to telecoms services.   EU countries will set up a  public warning system  to send alerts to citizens on their mobile phones in the event of a natural disaster or other major emergency in their area.    EU countries must provide operators with predictable regulationfor radio spectrum licensing for wireless broadband  for at least 20 years to promote investment, in particular in 5G connectivity; increased convergence of national selection procedures through a Peer Review Forum.    New frequency bands for 5G connectivity  for faster internet connections and better connectivity, as well as coordinated timing of spectrum licensing and a lighter regulatory regime for small mobile network equipment deployment.    Rules on operator access to networks to encourage competition  make it easier for companies to invest in new, very high capacity infrastructure (download speeds of 100 Mbps or more), including in remote areas, while ensuring effective market regulation.    New tools will address issues that may arise in certain market circumstances  . Symmetric regulation  *  will apply to electronic communications network providers  in some very specific situations  to ensure competition.   from when does this directive apply  It entered into force on 20 December 2018.  Directive (EU) 2018/1972  recasts  and replaces Directives  2002/19/EC  ,  2002/20/EC  and  2002/21/EC  (and their subsequent amendments) which had to become law in the EU countries by 2003. The new rules contained in Directive (EU) 2018/1972 apply and have to become law in the EU countries by 21 December 2020   background   See also:    Press release on EU’s telecoms rules  (  European Commission  )    Political agreement on the rules shaping the telecommunication markets in the 5G era  (  European Commission  )    Factsheet: Spectrum in the EU  (  European Commission  )    Factsheet: More and better internet connectivity requires investments in high speed and quality networks  (  European Commission  )    Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI)  (  European Commission  )    Connectivity for a European Gigabit Society  (  European Commission  )    Electronic communications laws  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    5G:  the latest generation of cellular mobile communication, characterised by a high data rate, reduced latency, energy saving, cost reduction, higher system capacity and greater device connectivity.

   The renewed social agenda     The renewed social agenda     The renewed social agenda completes the Lisbon Strategy for the period 2008-2010. It proposes an integrated approach with a view to responding to transformations in the employment market and European society.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 2 July 2008 - Renewed social agenda: Opportunities, access and solidarity in 21st century Europe       COM(2008) 412      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This Communication establishes the priorities which should direct European social policy for the period 2008-2010. The renewed social agenda is based upon the results of the Lisbon Strategy with regard to economic stability and employment. Furthermore, so as to better respond to the socio-economic challenges of the XXIst century, its scope is extended to new areas of policy action structured around three goals:      creating new opportunities in the employment market;       facilitating access to education, social protection, health care and quality services for all;       developing solidarity at the heart of European society, so to foster social inclusion and equal opportunities for all.      These goals will be achieved, at Community level, through the implementation of legislation, appropriate financing and the cooperation of Member States. The Commission supports the renewal of the Open Method of Coordination (OMC) in the area of youth and the reinforcement of the OMC in the areas of social protection and social inclusion as well as the development of social dialogue,       civil dialogue      and       active European citizenship      .      PRIORITY AREAS FOR ACTION       Children and youth      Quality education systems adapted to the needs of the employment market should contribute to the inclusion of young people in society. New initiatives from the Commission should, in particular, target the protection of the rights of the child and the fight against child poverty.      More and better jobs and the enhancement of skills      In line with the Lisbon Strategy and the European Sustainable Development Strategy, the social agenda encourages the modernisation of employment markets. To this end, Member States should apply common principles relating to flexicurity and promoting lifelong education and training.     In particular the Commission proposes to improve the functioning of European Works Councils. The Commission announces a new initiative for the assessment of labour market and skills needs up to 2020. It also promotes entrepreneurship and the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT).      Mobility      The Commission should pursue actions promoting the free movement of workers, the protection of their social rights and their working conditions, as well as the total suppression of obstacles to their free movement within the European Union (EU). Social partners must take an active part in achieving the objectives of the European       Job Mobility      Action Plan.     The Commission proposes action in favour of the mobility of knowledge, notably with the aim of facilitating the mobility of researchers, young entrepreneurs, students and volunteers.      Improving the quality of life and the inclusion of the elderly      In the context of an ageing European society, Member States should be able to ensure quality, viable and accessible health systems. The Commission proposes, in particular, the development of patients’ rights to cross-border health care. It supports the development of ICTs in the field of health care, personal services and research.      The fight against poverty and social exclusion      The social agenda anticipates an integrated strategy of active inclusion of the most disadvantaged such as the unemployed, the handicapped, the elderly and women. It aims at encouraging income support, access to employment and services, the information society, education and training.      The fight against discrimination      The Commission pursues the reinforcing of the legal framework with regard to the fight against discrimination both within and outside the field of employment. Community policies specifically target equal treatment between men and women, notably through the promotion of access by women to the labour market and equal pay between men and women.      The promotion of social rights at worldwide level      The EU plays a role at international level in promoting high social standards protecting workers, consumers and the environment. The action is carried out within the framework of external cooperation agreements, trade policies, development assistance and EU accession negotiations. The Commission also encourages Member States to apply the conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO).      CONTEXT      In 2007 the Commission launched a public consultation in order to take stock of social reality in Europe. The renewed social agenda takes into account the global economic slowdown, the ageing population and the latest technological progress.     The goals and measures in the social agenda will be reviewed in 2010 together with the Lisbon Strategy.     Last updated: 03.06.2009  
   Further integration of the European rail system: third railway package     Further integration of the European rail system: third railway package     The aim of this communication from the Commission is to revitalise the rail transport sector by improving its attractiveness and competitiveness. It covers the following aspects: driver training, passengers' rights and the opening-up of the passenger transport market.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 3 March 2004 entitled "Further integration of the European rail system: the third railway package [       COM(2004) 140      final - not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     In 2001 the Commission set out its objectives for the reform of rail transport in the White Paper "       European transport policy for 2010: time to decide      ".The present communication announces the third railway package. The Commission proposes the opening-up of services to competition by 2010 and puts forward proposals concerning the certification of drivers and strengthening of passengers' rights.     This third railway package comprises two directives and two regulations (of which one was rejected by the Parliament):      Proposal for a Directive [         COM(2004) 142        final] on the certification of drivers      In its communication the Commission stresses the impact of driver training on safety. It considers that driver skills fall into two categories:      general skills relating to the job of driver;       more specific skills relating to line knowledge, the rolling stock and the operating procedures of the railway undertaking for which the driver works.      With the opening-up of the rail freight markets, a growing number of drivers will find themselves operating on the network of another Member State. The Commission therefore wishes to establish:      a certification system attesting that the driver has sufficient general knowledge, authenticated by a licence issued to the individual driver that is recognised and valid throughout the Community;       a series of certificates attesting to specific knowledge (relating to a specific route, rolling stock and railway undertaking) and allowing the driver to operate.       Proposal for a Regulation [         COM(2004) 143        final] on passengers' rights      In order to make the railways more attractive, the Commission also wishes passengers' rights to be better protected - particularly with regard to reimbursement for train delays. The situation of passengers on international journeys is often less secure. The Commission therefore considers that the current international arrangements, based on the Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail (COTIF), are inadequate and do not directly create passengers' rights.     Access to information and fares, and the option of buying international rail tickets easily, are in the Commission's view the very least that is needed to make rail services attractive. In addition, the Commission wishes liability to be clearly defined in the event of accidents, incidents or train delays. On this last point, compensation thresholds should be set and the various channels for passengers' appeals clearly identified. Lastly, the Commission considers that greater account should be taken of the needs of people with reduced mobility.     In the Commission's view, these arrangements to protect passengers' rights will be all the more vital once the market is opened up for certain services.      Proposal for a Directive [         COM(2004) 139        final] on opening up the passenger transport market      The Commission stresses the contrasts between regional, national and international rail traffic and wishes to take these diverse segments into account by combining two models for opening up to competition:      under the first, a competitive procedure can be used to award a public service contract. In the Commission's view this model would work well for suburban and regional services, which transport the vast majority of passengers. It forms the basis of the Commission's proposal to modernise Regulation No         1191/69        on public service obligations;       the other model consists in opening up access to the infrastructure for operators wishing to provide international services. This model would be better suited to long-distance services and to specific services where commercial innovation is likely to attract new customers.      The competitors will need to have:      rolling stock and drivers authorised for service in the Member States in which they plan to operate;       a railway undertaking licence in a Member State;       a safety certificate issued by the national safety authority of each of the Member States they plan to cross;       infrastructure capacity, in order to provide a regular service.      The Commission therefore wishes all international services to be opened up to competition on 1 January 2010. This opening-up also includes cabotage on international services (carriage of passengers between two places within the same Member State).      Interoperability requirements      The Commission also points out that integrating Europe's railway systems requires technical harmonisation in order to ensure the interoperability of rolling stock and equipment.      A fourth proposal rejected by the Parliament      The Commission had also made a proposal for a regulation aiming to improve the quality of rail services. It was rejected first time round by the Parliament. In particular the text proposed establishing mandatory minimum clauses in transport contracts, among which there was a proposal for a compensation system in case of freight being delayed or damaged. It would have encouraged railway undertakings and their clients to regulate quality management contractually.     Last updated: 29.08.2007  
summary of   Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 establishing the European Banking Authority   what is the aim of the regulation  It sets up the EU agency which works to ensure effective and consistent prudential regulation and supervision across the European banking sector. The agency's overall objectives are to maintain financial stability in the EU and to safeguard the integrity, efficiency and orderly functioning of the banking sector.   key points    Consistent application of EU law   The  European Banking Authority (EBA)  :   draws up regulatory technical standards to specify the banking legislation to be adopted by the  European Commission  , where the  Council  and the  European Parliament  delegate this power to the Commission;   has the power to issue guidelines and recommendations on the application of EU legislation.    Stress tests   The EBA has a prominent role in the EU-wide  stress test exercise  that examines  banks’ resilience  with regard to adverse market developments, and any systemic risks in the EU financial system.   It initiates and coordinates stress tests in the EU with the national authorities responsible for supervising banks.   In cooperation with the  European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB)  , the  European Central Bank (ECB)  and the Commission, the EBA defines a common methodology for each edition of the stress test.   It also monitors and assesses market and credit trends.    Breach of EU law    The EBA has the power to investigate the alleged incorrect application by a national supervisor of EU banking and financial legislation (in particular when it fails to ensure that a bank complies with the requirements laid down in that legislation).   The EBA may address a recommendation to the particular national supervisor. If the supervisor does not comply with this, the Commission can then be empowered to issue a formal opinion taking into account the EBA’s recommendation.   If a national supervisor persists in not complying with the law, the EBA can adopt decisions directly addressed to the bank. This power can only be used in  exceptional circumstances  .    European financial supervision   The EBA is part of the  European system of financial supervision  created in 2010, which, in addition to the ESRB, comprises 2 other supervisory organisations:   the supervisory authority in charge of the insurance and pension sector, based in Frankfurt am Main (  European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority — EIOPA  );   the supervisory authority in charge of the financial markets, based in Paris (  European Securities and Markets Authority — ESMA  ).    Payment services   Directive (EU)  2015/2366  introduced revised rules for payment services in the EU. It strengthens the role of the EBA and requires it to issue guidelines and draft regulatory technical standards in various fields, for example to clarify the rules on ‘passporting’ for payment institutions operating in several EU countries, or to ensure the establishment of adequate security requirements.   Headquarters   Under Regulation (EU)  2018/1717  , in the context of the United Kingdom’s intention to withdraw from the EU, the seat of the EBA was relocated from London to Paris as of 30 March 2019.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 1 January 2011.   background   For more information, see:    European Banking Authority  (  European Banking Authority  ).
   Financing instrument for development cooperation - DCI (2007-2013)     Financing instrument for development cooperation - DCI (2007-2013)     The financing instrument for development cooperation improves the Community's previous development cooperation framework by merging the different geographic and thematic instruments into a single instrument.     ACT     Regulation (EC) No       1905/2006      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation [       See amending act(s)      ].     SUMMARY     The Regulation sets up a financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI) which replaces the range of geographic and thematic instruments created over time and as needs arose. Its aim is to improve development cooperation.     Under this instrument, the European Communities finance measures aimed at supporting geographic cooperation with the developing countries included in the list of aid recipients of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD/DAC). These countries are listed in Annex 1 to the Regulation.     The Regulation emphasises that the Community's development cooperation policy is guided by the       Millennium Development Goals      (MDGs) and that the “       European Consensus      ” provides the general framework for action by the Community on development matters. It also reaffirms that the objectives of this policy are poverty reduction, sustainable economic and social development and the smooth and gradual integration of developing countries into the world economy.      Nature of the instrument      The Regulation provides that Community aid is implemented through geographic and thematic programmes and through the programme of accompanying measures for the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Sugar Protocol countries.      Geographic programmes      encompass cooperation with partner countries and regions determined on a geographical basis. They cover five regions, namely Latin America, Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East and South Africa. Community assistance to these countries is aimed at supporting actions within the following areas of cooperation:      supporting the implementation of policies aimed at poverty eradication and at the achievement of the MDGs;       addressing the essential needs of the population, in particular primary education and health;       promoting social cohesion and employment;       promoting governance, democracy, human rights and support for institutional reforms;       assisting partner countries and regions in the areas of trade and regional integration;       promoting sustainable development through environmental protection and sustainable management of natural resources;       supporting sustainable integrated water resource management and fostering greater use of sustainable energy technologies;       assistance in post-crisis situations and fragile States.      The measures taken vary according to the specific needs of each country, taking into account the specific situation in Latin America, Asia, the Middle East or South Africa.      Thematic programmes      complement geographic programmes. They cover a specific area of activity of interest to a group of partner countries not determined by geography, or cooperation activities focusing on various regions or groups of partner countries, or an international operation that is not geographically specific. In other words, their scope of application is wider than that of geographic cooperation programmes because they encompass not only the countries eligible for geographic cooperation under the DCI but also the countries and regions eligible under the       European Development Fund      (EDF) and under Regulation (EC) No       1638/2006      .     The Regulation provides for five thematic programmes concerning:       investing in people        ;       the         environment and the sustainable management of natural resources        ;        non-state actors and Local Authorities        ;       the         improvement of food security        ;        cooperation in the area or migration and asylum        .      The Regulation also sets up a programme of accompanying measures in favour of the       18 ACP Sugar Protocol countries      (listed in Annex III to the Regulation). The aim of these measures is to support their adjustment process as they are faced with new market conditions due to the reform of the Community sugar regime.      Management and implementation      For the geographic programmes, the Commission draws up a strategy paper and a multiannual indicative programme and adopts an annual action programme for each partner country or region. In the case of thematic programmes, it draws up thematic strategy papers and adopts annual action programmes.     The Commission determines the multiannual indicative allocations within each geographic programme, bearing in mind the specificity of the different programmes and the particular difficulties faced by the countries or regions that are in crisis, in conflict or disaster-prone.     It may also include a specific financial allocation for the purposes of strengthening cooperation between the EU's outermost regions and neighbouring partner countries and regions. In the case of natural disasters or crises which cannot be funded under Regulations (EC) No       1717/2006      and       1257/1996      , the Commission may adopt special measures not provided for in the strategy papers or multiannual indicative programmes.     The       entities which are eligible for funding      are,       inter alia      , the following:      partner countries and regions, and their institutions;       decentralised bodies in the partner countries (municipalities, provinces, departments and regions);       joint bodies set up by the partner countries and regions with the Community;       international organisations;       EU agencies;       certain entities and bodies of the Member States, partner countries and regions and any other third country in so far as they help to achieve the objectives of this Regulation.      Under this Regulation, the Community may finance among other things, projects and programmes, contribute to national funds set up by partner countries and regions to attract joint financing from several donors, contribute to funds set up by one or more donors for the purpose of the joint implementation of measures, twinning programmes, interest-rate subsidies, especially for environment-related loans, and debt relief under internationally agreed debt relief programmes.     The measures are eligible for co-financing from Member States and their regional and local authorities, other donor countries, international organisations, companies, firms and other private organisations and businesses, other non-state actors and partner countries in receipt of funding.     The       financial framework      for the implementation of this Regulation over the period 2007-2013 is EUR 16.897 billion: EUR 10.057 billion for the geographic programmes, EUR 5.596 billion for the thematic programmes and EUR 1.244 billion for the ACP Sugar Protocol countries.     The Commission monitors and reviews the implementation of its programmes. It submits an       annual report      on the results of this Regulation to the European Parliament and the Council.     The Commission is assisted in its work by a committee.     Not later than 31 December 2010, the Commission must submit a report evaluating the implementation of this Regulation in the first three years with, if appropriate, a legislative proposal introducing the necessary modifications.     Article 39 of the Regulation repeals the regulations relating to:      access to Community external assistance;       promoting gender equality in development cooperation;       the AENEAS programme;       the fight against poverty diseases in developing countries;       reproductive and sexual health and rights in developing countries;       aid to uprooted people in Asian and Latin American developing countries;       the conservation and sustainable management of tropical forests and other forests in developing countries;       full integration of the environmental dimension in the development process;       development cooperation with South Africa;       decentralised cooperation;       co-financing operations with European non-governmental organisations;       food-aid policy and food-aid management;       financial and technical assistance to, and economic cooperation with, the developing countries in Asia and Latin America.

   Sustainable power generation from fossil fuels     Sustainable power generation from fossil fuels     In this Communication the Commission assesses how and at what cost power can be generated from fossil fuels in future while reducing the associated greenhouse gas emissions.     ACT     Commission Communication of 10 January 2007 "Sustainable power generation from fossil fuels: aiming for near-zero emissions from coal after 2020" [       COM(2006) 843      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The large-scale use of fossil fuels (oil, natural gas and coal) is the main cause of man-made climate change resulting from the CO2 emissions produced. The power generation sector accounts for a major proportion of these emissions and the upward trend is set to continue in future.     Over 50% of EU electricity comes from fossil fuels, mainly coal, which accounts for about 30% of overall electricity generation in the EU. To help secure the EU's energy supply, coal will continue to play a key role in the energy sources used. In 2005 CO2 emissions from coal-based electricity generation accounted for 70% of total CO2 emissions due to electricity generation in the EU, and 24% of CO2 emissions from all sectors taken together.     These energy sources, particularly coal, will also become more and more important in power generation in certain parts of the world over the coming decades (China and India in particular) as a result of the significant rise in demand for energy.     It is therefore essential for the EU to set up the right framework now for the development and distribution of sustainable coal technologies, and thus limit CO2 emissions from the use of coal for electricity generation.     The improvements already made in coal technologies (increase in energy efficiency and a reduction in acid rain and local atmospheric pollution due to SO2, NOx and particulate emissions) show that significant technological progress is possible, in particular by applying the principle of carbon capture and storage (CCS).      Technologies for the sustainable use of fossil fuels      Technologies for the sustainable use of coal will be based on an optimum combination of 'clean coal' technologies (improving yield and reducing atmospheric emissions) and CCS technologies. Continued development of these technologies and demonstrating their commercial viability will lead to their large-scale use.     To achieve this, a substantial increase in funding for research is required for the development of technological demonstration projects at both national and Community level. Routine cooperation between the industrial sector and the pubic authorities is called for, via a coordination and support structure based on the Zero Emission Fossil Fuel Power Plant Technology Platform launched in 2006. The Commission is also to study what other appropriate demonstration measures should be taken in the short term.     The best available technology will have to be used for modernising the EU's stock of coal-fired power plants, enabling CO2 emissions generated by them to be cut by 20% by 2020. The Commission will assess whether using the best available technology is effective and will consider proposing the adoption of legally binding instruments to promote it where necessary.      A framework for developing these technologies      The EU needs a regulatory and economic framework that rewards low-carbon technologies. It will have to ensure the long-term use of sustainable coal technologies to promote investment and the transition to such technologies.     The Commission therefore recommends:      assessing the potential risks involved in carbon capture and storage, a process which will involve public internet-based consultation;       proposing requirements for using these technologies, allowing the risks to be properly managed;       incorporating these requirements into the existing regulatory framework, i.e. the         greenhouse gas emission quota exchange system        and the         Environmental Impact Assessment        and         Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directives        .      The Commission also thinks that new coal-fired power plants should be built with CCS systems by 2020 and that existing plants should be gradually retrofitted. Incentives could be provided (by adopting legally binding objectives and setting up EU storage sites, for example).     The EU will also continue its efforts at international level to conclude an agreement to limit the rise in the Earth's temperature to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. CCS will be one of the options to be used in this connection. The EU will support the amendment of some of the existing international agreements and conventions to reduce the barriers to CCS technologies (for example under the seabed).      Costs and benefits of sustainable fossil fuels technologies      The construction of new CCS-ready plants should not necessarily lead to additional costs, while the construction of plants for the industrial-scale demonstration of sustainable coal use will require substantial financial resources, as will the retrofitting of existing power plants after 2020.     CCS technologies are as yet too costly for large-scale use. However, technological improvements over the coming years and the side benefits of CCS should limit the rise in the cost of electricity from plants using these technologies to 10% of current levels by 2020 or even fully cancel them out. Also, the potential rise in the cost of electricity generated in coal-fired plants should not translate, at least not fully, into higher electricity prices for consumers.     The Commission thinks that any negative environmental effects of CCS will stem mainly from potential leakage. However, the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concludes that the proportion of CO2 retained in well-selected and well-managed storage sites is very likely to exceed 99% over 100 years.     The sustainable use of fossil fuels, in particular CCS, will make it possible to eliminate up to 90% of the carbon emissions from fossil-fuel power plants, i.e. an overall reduction in CO2 emissions in the 27 EU Member States of 27 to 30% by 2030 compared to 2000. The use of appropriate technologies will also enable the atmospheric pollutants traditionally associated with coal combustion, including NOx and SO2, to be reduced, thus resulting in lower local environmental and health costs.     If the EU can display strong international leadership in the development of sustainable fossil fuel technologies, this will enable it to create jobs and export its technology, and will have a positive knock-on effect on third countries. To achieve this, there will need to be close cooperation, particularly at technological and trade level, with coal-using countries, including China, the United States, India and the developing countries.      Background      The Communication is part of the "energy package" published by the Commission in January 2007, which sets out a new European energy policy with quantified targets.     RELATED ACTS      Commission Communication of 10 January 2007 on an Energy Policy for Europe [         COM(2007) 1        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      This Communication is the main feature of the package of measures presented by the Commission in January 2007 (the "energy package"). After reviewing the energy challenges facing Europe, in particular climate change and the EU's security of supply, the Commission details a number of actions relating, among other things, to the internal energy market, security of supply, energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, energy technologies and international energy policy.      Commission Communication of 10 January 2007 "Limiting Global Climate Change to 2 degrees Celsius - The way ahead for 2020 and beyond" [         COM(2007) 2        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      In this Communication the Commission looks at the costs and benefits of tackling climate change and recommends a number of measures to limit global warming to 2° Celsius. Some of the measures apply to the European Union alone (binding greenhouse gas emission targets and the adoption of energy measures, among others) while others are international in outlook (in particular, negotiation of an international agreement).      Commission         Green Paper        of 8 March 2006 "A European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy" [         COM(2006) 105        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      With this Green Paper the Commission maps out a genuine European energy policy to meet the numerous challenges in terms of supply and the impact on growth and the environment in Europe.

   Rare diseases: Europe’s challenges     Rare diseases: Europe’s challenges     The Commission proposes a strategic approach to improving the recognition of rare diseases and patient access to suitable treatment. It supports cooperation between the European Union (EU) Member States and the development of a network of experts made up of health professionals.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 11 November 2008 on Rare Diseases - Europe's challenges [       COM(2008) 679      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Rare diseases, 80% being genetic in origin, are defined as those diseases which affect not more than 5 per 10 000 persons in Europe. The limited number of patients accounts for the current low level of medical knowledge and expertise, even though these diseases can lead to the death or disability of the people affected.     This communication presents a comprehensive Community strategy aimed at supporting the recognition, prevention, management and treatment of rare diseases. The Commission encourages Member States to share their knowledge and resources in this field. The Commission will be assisted by the European Union Advisory Committee on Rare Diseases (EUACRD).      Identification and visibility      The Commission is contributing to the development of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) developed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and to the classification and codification of rare diseases in the new version of this classification. The Commission also supports the development of an evolving European database aimed at professionals and patients.     Information networks and European Reference Networks for rare diseases are essential means for exchanging best practice and epidemiological expertise.      Screening, diagnosis and prevention      Member States should be able to use comparable data with regard to the screening and primary prevention of rare diseases. Early diagnosis of diseases can be made using biological tests. The design and validation of these tests can be facilitated through the establishment of European reference networks of expert diagnostic laboratories.      Access to care      Member States are undertaking concrete measures to ensure the quality of and universal access to care, in particular by establishing centres of expertise at national and regional levels. Their activity could be extended to providing social services in order to improve the quality of life of patients.      Access to medication      National authorities should proceed with a joint scientific assessment of       orphan medicinal products      . Member States should adapt their pricing and reimbursement systems on the basis of this assessment.     The Commission requests that the European Medicines Agency (       EMA      ) encourage a common approach to improving access to compassionate use programmes. These programmes allow the provision of new medicines before they have been approved and/or reimbursed.     Regulations applicable to       medical devices      should be adapted to the market for orphan medicinal products. The Commission should also provide for incentive measures to encourage pharmaceutical companies to develop new treatments.      e-Health      Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) contribute to facilitating the exchange of scientific data. The telemedicine systems and services can enable professionals to share their expertise and to gain specialist knowledge.     Scientific research is supported by the 7th Framework Programme, which funds the development of computer assisted modelling, in particular, with the aim of increasing knowledge of the physiological and pathological processes of rare diseases.      RELATED ACTS       Proposal for a Council recommendation of 11 November 2008 on a European action in the field of rare diseases       [         COM(2008) 726        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      This Proposal is based on the conclusions of the communication of 11 November 2008 which promotes a European strategic approach to rare diseases. In this context, the Council invites Member States to:      establish strategies and national plans before 2013 in order to ensure universal access to and the high quality of care;       adopt a European definition of rare diseases so that they can be referenced and coded more easily in care and reimbursement systems;       identify research priorities and ongoing projects, with particular regard to basic, clinical and translational research and enable patients to benefit from new therapeutic advances;       encourage the development of national and regional centres of expertise, cross-border care and expert networks;       adopt common methods in terms of screening, treatment and monitoring therapeutic techniques;       support the activities of parent associations;       ensure the viability of research infrastructures at national and European levels.      The Commission is invited to inform the Council on the progress of actions undertaken by Member States as part of the comprehensive strategy on rare diseases.

summary of   Communication (COM(2010) 579 final) — an EU Framework for Crisis Management in the Financial Sector   what is the aim of the communication  It sets out the steps to be taken to equip the European Union (EU) with a set of rules for crisis management in the financial sector.   key points    Scope   The set of rules for crisis management in the financial sector concerns:   all credit institutions;   certain investment firms, more particularly those whose failure might put the financial system at risk.    Objectives   The aim of these rules is to ensure that the financial system is stable, even in the event of a business failure, and to:   encourage prevention and preparation to reduce risks in the financial system;   prepare credible resolution tools;   implement fast and effective means to act;   reduce moral hazard by ensuring shareholders contribute to costs;   contribute to a smooth resolution of cross-border groups to preserve the internal market;   ensure legal certainty;   limit competitive distortions.    Areas of action   The communication identified measures that should be taken in the following areas:    authorities responsible for crisis management  — each EU country must designate a resolution authority that is independent from the supervisor;    preparatory and preventative measures  — including the implementation of a supervisory programme for each supervised institution and on-site supervisory examinations;    triggers  — early intervention should be put in place in case a bank or investment firm cannot satisfy the requirements of the  Capital Requirements Directive  ;    early intervention  — provides for the widening and clarifying of supervisors’ powers. Banks and businesses would be obliged to present a plan enabling the institution to recover in the event of financial difficulties;    debt write-down  — allowing an institution in difficulty to continue its activities or to cease some of them in order to limit risks of ‘contagion’ to other institutions;    resolution  — reform legislation on bank insolvency in order that failing banks may benefit from liquidation proceedings.    Action taken     1.     Supervisory authorities      3 European supervisory authorities were established in 2011:   the  European Banking Authority (EBA)  , which deals with bank supervision, including the supervision of the recapitalisation of banks;   the  European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)  , which deals with the supervision of capital markets and carries out direct supervision with regard to credit rating agencies and  trade repositories  ; and   the  European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA)  , which deals with insurance supervision.   The 28 national supervisors are represented in all 3 supervising authorities.  A  European Systemic Risk Board  was established to monitor and assess potential threats to financial stability that arise from macro-economic developments and from developments within the financial system as a whole.    2.     Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive      This  directive  (Directive 2014/59/EU) entered into force in all EU countries in July 2014. It sets out a number of rules to harmonise and improve the tools for dealing with bank crises across the EU, including:   banks are required to prepare recovery plans to overcome financial distress;   authorities are granted a set of powers to intervene in the operations of banks to avoid their failure;   authorities also have powers to implement plans to resolve failed banks in a way that preserves their most critical functions and avoids taxpayers having to bail them out;   a  Single Resolution Fund  for countries in the euro area was established in 2016; separate national funds remain in place for those EU countries outside the area;   procedures to improve cooperation between national authorities.     3.     Deposit Guarantee Schemes (DGSs) Directive      This  directive  (Directive 2014/49/EU) entered into force in 2014. It strengthens the existing system of national DGS to respond to the weaknesses revealed by the financial crisis. Its key elements include:   universal guarantee of deposits up to €100,000;   easier and faster access to repayment — a gradual reduction in payment deadlines from 20 working days to 7 working days;   more robust financing regime;   better information for depositors.   background     ‘Crisis management’  on the European Commission's website   European Commission press release  ‘A comprehensive EU response to the financial crisis: substantial progress towards a strong financial framework for Europe and a banking union for the eurozone’  .

summary   As a result of laws to gradually open up the market and revitalise rail transport,  rail’s modal share has now stabilised  after years of decline. Nevertheless, achieving a single European rail market has proven difficult. Europe’s market has been open for rail freight transport since 2007 and for international passenger services since 2010. Consequently, the Directive applies, with minor exceptions, to all railway lines of the European Union as well as the facilities and services necessary to access the rail system and operate trains in the EU.  Directive 2012/34/EU, establishing a single European railway area, merges previous directives (“the first Railway Package”) and their successive amendments into one act. It also adds  important substantive changes  to tackle the lack of competition, poor regulation and low investment observed in the rail market in the last decade. It applies to the rail freight and international passenger market segments.   More competition    Market access conditions  were insufficiently precise and thus worked in favour of the incumbent organisations (often, national monopolies). To address this issue, the directive:   Sets an exhaustive list of conditions for the licensing of railway undertakings on an EU wide basis and the access to licensing data;   requires more detailed  network statements  : these are documents published yearly providing characteristics of the available infrastructure and the conditions for its use;   ensures the  non-discriminatory access  of rail operators to rail-related services, such as railway stations, freight terminals and maintenance facilities. A service provider belonging to a body with a dominant position on the railway market in question must be independent (with separate accounts and organisational and decision-making, although there is no need to create a separate legal entity);   provides for competitive and non-discriminatory charges for using the infrastructure, facilities and services,   lays down rules on  conflicts of interest  and  unfair practices  in rail-related services.    Stronger regulatory oversight, a greater independence of regulatory bodies and reinforced cooperation of regulators at EU level   National rail regulators must be  independent  . They cannot have any stakes in regulated companies, their nomination must be done by authorities not exercising direct shareholder rights in regulated companies, and there are other clauses to protect their independence (e.g. there are new rules on cooling-on and cooling-off periods to control staff movements between the regulator and the regulated undertakings). Their competence to impose  sanctions and conduct audits  has been enhanced and they must work with their counterparts on cross-border issues. Their powers have been extended to cover  rail-related services  in order to eliminate discriminatory barriers.   Funding of infrastructure managers   Investment in the rail infrastructure is to be improved by longer-term planning, giving more  certainty  to investors. By December 2014, EU countries must publish an indicative  rail infrastructure development strategy  with a view to meeting future mobility needs in terms of maintenance, renewal and development of the infrastructure. This will be based on the  sustainable financing of the railway system  and have due regard to the Union’s state aid rules. It will cover a period of at least five years and be renewable and should also take into account the EU’s general needs, including the need to cooperate with neighbouring countries.

   Circular migration and mobility partnerships     Circular migration and mobility partnerships     The Commission suggests setting up mobility partnerships and organising circular migration to facilitate the movement of third‑country nationals between their countries and the European Union (EU). The mechanisms would alleviate the shortage of labour in the EU, check the phenomenon of illegal immigration and allow the countries of origin to benefit from the positive impacts of emigration.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 16 May 2007 on circular migration and mobility partnerships between the European Union and third countries [       COM(2007) 248      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This communication focuses on two aspects: mobility partnerships and circular migration. Regarding the first aspect, the Commission is planning exploratory contacts with a series of countries potentially interested. Regarding the second aspect, it is planning to launch a consultation process lasting at least three months.      Mobility partnerships      The Commission proposes that the European Community (EC) negotiates mobility partnerships with third countries with a view to enabling their citizens to have better access to the European Union (EU). These partnerships would involve third countries determined to cooperate with the EU in the management of migration flows, including by fighting illegal immigration.     Each partnership would come under the general framework of external relations with the third country concerned. It would be tailored to the ambitions of the parties to the agreement and the level of commitments that this third country is prepared to take on.     Concerning the content of the partnership, the Commission lists a whole series of possible commitments by the third country, such as readmission of its own nationals and third‑country nationals who crossed its territory before arrival in the EU, organisation of targeted information campaigns to discourage illegal immigrants, strengthening of border controls and stepping up of the fight against fraudulent documents.     For its part, the EU could allow nationals from the countries concerned greater possibilities for mobility to the EU, with due regard for the competences of the Member States. These possibilities could include:      Circular migration      The Commission indicates that the two main forms of circular migration which could be most relevant in the EU context are:      that of third‑country nationals residing in the EU, such as business people from third countries working in the EU and wishing to start an activity in their country of origin or in another third country;       that of third‑country nationals established outside the EU, such as nationals wishing to engage in seasonal or temporary work within the EU or to study there before returning to their country.      The Commission points out that harmonisation of national legislation could improve circular migration. It states that components of a European legislative framework have already been considered in the Policy Plan on legal migration, such as the proposal for a Directive on the admission of highly skilled migrants.     New measures could be considered to supplement the Policy Plan on legal migration, such as the adaptation of Directive       2003/109/EC      concerning the status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents.     A number of incentives could be built into EU policy instruments to promote circularity, for example:      support for the job search or for setting up businesses to facilitate the re‑integration of migrants returning to their country of origin;       a written commitment by migrants to return voluntarily to their countries of origin once their contract expires;       the conclusion and implementation of readmission arrangements to ensure the effective return of the national in the case of an illegal stay within EU territory;       the establishment of criteria to monitor circular migration programmes.      The Commission also suggests the adoption of measures to reduce the risk of brain drain. To this end, it suggests, for example, commitments by Member States not to recruit third‑country nationals in sectors indicated by a country as being under stress.     Finally, it adds that bilateral agreements could be concluded between these countries and the Member States interested. For example, these agreements could contain provisions granting scholarships for "circular" students.      Background      This communication follows on from the communications entitled "Migration and Development: some concrete orientations" of       1 September 2005      and "The Global Approach to Migration one year on" of       31 November 2006      and the communication on a Policy Plan on legal migration of       21 December 2005      .

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 – EU system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and the labelling of beef and beef products   what is the aim of the regulation  It requires each EU country to manage a system for identifying and registering cattle. The rules, which include compulsory labelling, are designed to eradicate disease and to make it possible to trace beef and veal throughout the whole food chain.   key points    Every animal, including imported cattle, must have a tag in each ear making it possible to identify them and to determine where they were born.   EU countries must establish a database containing details of all cattle and their movements.   Every animal is given a passport within 2 weeks of being born or imported. This must accompany it whenever it is moved and be handed in on its death.   Every farmer must maintain an up-to-date register and report all births, deaths and cattle movements to the relevant authorities, within 3 to 7 days of the event. The records must be available for up to 3 years.   Labels on all beef and veal on sale in the EU must contain a reference code making it possible to identify its origin and details of where the animal was slaughtered and butchered.   Since 1 January 2002, the labels also state the animal's country of birth and where it was fattened and slaughtered.   The labels may contain additional voluntary information about the meat being sold, but the wording must first be approved by the competent national authority.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 14 August 2000.
   Environment strategy for the Mediterranean     Environment strategy for the Mediterranean     The Commission outlines the essential features of a coordinated strategy for the Mediterranean basin to protect the marine environment and the coastline of this region and to reduce pollution by 2020. This strategy is based on enhanced cooperation between the countries concerned in the political, financial and technical arenas, and provides for the accomplishment of targeted activities, planned within a common initiative known as "Horizon 2020".     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 5 September 2006 entitled: "Establishing an environment strategy for the Mediterranean" [       COM(2006) 475      final - Not published in the Official Journal]     SUMMARY     The Mediterranean is the largest European sea and is bordered onto by seven Member States of the European Union (EU), two accession countries and more than a dozen third countries.     This grouping around the Mediterranean creates clear interdependence between the countries bordering it. Pollution has a direct impact on neighbouring countries, and natural resources (water, air, soils and biodiversity) are connected in complex ecosystems whose use and conservation are matters affecting every one of the Mediterranean countries.     The Mediterranean environment is fragile and continues to deteriorate in spite of all the efforts made. For several of the countries bordering the Mediterranean, this deterioration costs billions of euros a year. The initiatives and strategies which have been developed over the last thirty years are not being properly implemented, or are not being implemented at all. This situation is due not only to the limited funding available but also the low political priority given to the environment, the lack of inclusive environmental governance, and the limited public awareness of the issues at stake.     Environmental action in the Mediterranean therefore needs to be strengthened by means of a coordinated strategy between the EU and the various countries concerned. This strategy focuses mainly on the Mediterranean countries which are covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestinian Authority, Syria and Tunisia). For their part, EU Member States and the accession countries must apply EU environment legislation.      Objectives of a regional strategy      The regional cooperation strategy for the environment proposed by the Commission is aimed in particular at:      helping partner countries to create appropriate institutions, develop an effective policy and establish a legal framework that enables environmental concerns to be integrated into other sectors of activity;       reducing levels of pollution and the impact of uncontrolled activity;       preparing local administrations to react to emergencies as well as to one-off and long-term issues;       making more sustainable use of land and sea areas;       increasing information, awareness and the participation of the public;       encouraging regional cooperation amongst partner countries.       Means of action      To achieve these objectives, the countries concerned will be able to secure financial aid from,       inter alia      , the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) and the thematic programme       Environment and Sustainable Management of Natural Resources including Water      , loans from the International Financial Institutions (IFI), contributions from donors, and national resources. The limited scope of the financial resources available means that these funds will be targeted at sites which give most cause for concern and the use of these resources will be coordinated.     Furthermore, political dialogue will be strengthened within the framework of the official structures of meetings for cooperation between the EU and third countries (Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, European Neighbourhood Policy) or at international level (New Partnership for African Development, African Union). The Commission also plans to support the creation of networks of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and contacts between NGOs, and will make sure that all appropriate partners are associated with the development and implementation of the environment policy.     The Commission will also pursue its cooperation with various partners, such as the organisations linked to the 1976       Barcelona Convention      for the protection of the Mediterranean environment, with in particular the implementation of the joint Mediterranean Action Plan/European Commission Work Programme signed in 2005. The memoranda of understanding with certain international financial institutions (World Bank, European Investment Bank) will be fully exploited and contacts will be strengthened with other funding providers (Global Environment Facility and Strategic Investment Fund). These links will moreover be boosted by setting up a "Horizon 2020" steering group.     The EU has wide experience in combating pollution and addressing sustainable development, in particular from the       LIFE      and       SMAP      programmes and the research framework programmes. This experience will be shared with partner countries, in particular through instruments such as the Tourism Sustainability Group set up by the Commission and TAIEX (Technical Assistance Information Exchange Office), which is now open to countries covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy.      Horizon 2020 and beyond      In November 2005, at the summit held to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, the leaders present agreed to increase efforts to reduce pollution of the Mediterranean Sea. As a result, the Commission launched "Horizon 2020" which is intended to reduce pollution substantially by 2020. This initiative will be based on existing environmental instruments and will help to fulfil the commitments entered into under the Barcelona Convention. It is accompanied by a proposed timetable for the measures planned.     Horizon 2020 consists of four parts:      projects to reduce pollution which chiefly cover the sectors regarded as priorities, namely municipal waste, urban waste water and industrial emissions;       capacity-building measures, in particular the development of legislation and institutions, and support for local authorities and civil society;       research, in particular in the fields of health, food, agriculture, energy, climate change, soil and transport. Major importance will be attached to disseminating the relevant knowledge acquired by means of the LIFE programmes, the research framework programmes, the actions of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and other international activities;       monitoring and management of the initiative, in particular by developing a scoreboard to measures the progress made and setting up a consultative steering committee responsible for ensuring the implementation of the initiative.      Complementary activities will also need to be developed to meet the objectives not covered by Horizon 2020, including, among other things, full implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy action plans, further integration of environmental concerns into the relevant economic sectors, combating global threats such as climate change and biodiversity loss, addressing regional risks (coastal zone management, drought, flooding, etc.), the use of impact and environmental assessments, and the production of indicators.

   Equal treatment as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion     Equal treatment as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion     The purpose of this Directive is to ensure equal treatment for men and women in respect of access to employment, vocational training and career advancement, as well as working conditions.     ACT     Council Directive       76/207/EEC      of 9 February 1976 on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     The principle of equal treatment means that there should be       no discrimination whatsoever on the grounds of sex      , either directly or indirectly, by reference in particular to marital or family status. Member States may, however, exclude from the Directive’s scope occupational activities for which, by reason of their nature, or the context in which they are carried out, the sex of the worker constitutes a determining factor.     The Directive is without prejudice to provisions concerning the       protection of women      (pregnancy, maternity), or to measures to remove existing inequalities which affect women's opportunities in the areas covered by the Directive.     Application of the principle means that there should be no discrimination on grounds of sex in the conditions, including selection criteria, for access to all jobs or posts at all levels of the hierarchy.     The principle applies to access to all types and all levels of vocational guidance, basic and advanced vocational training and retraining.     Application of the principle to       working conditions      , including conditions governing dismissal, means that men and women must be guaranteed the same conditions.     Member States must take the measures necessary to ensure that:      any laws, regulations and administrative provisions contrary to the principle of equality are abolished or amended if they were originally based on a concern for protection which is no longer well-founded;       inappropriate provisions included in collective agreements, individual contracts of employment, the internal rules of undertakings or rules governing independent professions can be declared null and void or amended.      Labour and management must be requested to undertake the revision of such provisions in collective agreements.     Persons wronged by       failure to apply the principle      must have the right to pursue their claims by judicial process.     Employees must be protected against dismissal by the employer as a reaction to a complaint within the undertaking or to any legal proceedings aimed at enforcing compliance with the principle of equal treatment.     The provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive and the relevant provisions already in force must be brought to the attention of employees by all appropriate means.     Member States must periodically assess the occupational activities excluded from the field of application of the Directive in order to decide, in the light of social developments, whether there is justification for maintaining the exclusions concerned.

RELATED ACTS      Report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 29 July 2009 - Report on the application of Directive 2002/73/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 23 September 2002 amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions [         COM(2009) 409        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      This Report was produced by the Commission based on information received from the Member States. The majority of Member States made progress in implementing Directive 2002/73/CE. The main legislative changes shall ensure:      access to legal and administrative procedures before and after the labour relationship has ended;       the right to legal recourse by any organisation which has legitimate interest in acting on behalf of, or in support of, a victim of discrimination;       victims are protected from victimisation as well as third parties assisting the victim.      However, some Member States are still required to amend their legislation significantly, specifically with regard to compensation or reparation for loss or damage and sanction schemes. The Directive provides for the establishment or development of organisations responsible for ensuring and promoting equality. However, their visibility amongst the general public must be improved in the majority of Member States.     The Report stresses that participation of all the stakeholders involved is essential, whether they are employers, representatives from trade unions or civil society organisations. The 2007 European Year of Equal Opportunities for All and financing from the structural funds have also significantly contributed to promoting equality.     Last updated: 07.01.2010  
summary of   Commission Recommendation – the definition of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises   summary    what does this recommendation do  It sets out the criteria for identifying whether a company is a micro, small or medium-sized enterprise (SME). These different categories, based on the number of a company's employees and its turnover or balance sheet, determine its eligibility for EU and national financial and support programmes. The definitions came into effect on 1 January 2005.   key points     Definitions:    micro enterprise: fewer than 10 employees and an annual turnover (the amount of money taken in a particular period) or balance sheet (a statement of a company's assets and liabilities) below €2 million.   small enterprise: fewer than 50 employees and an annual turnover or balance sheet below €10 million.   medium-sized enterprise: fewer than 250 employees and annual turnover below €50 million or balance sheet below €43 million.     SMEs meeting the different  criteria  can benefit from   EU and national business support programmes, such as research, competitiveness and innovation funding, which otherwise would not be allowed under EU state aid rules,   fewer requirements or reduced costs when complying with EU legislation.     The  European Commission  regularly monitors the practical impact of the definitions. An  independent study  published in September 2012 concluded that there was no need to revisit the criteria, but some clarification and guidance of the existing rules might be useful.   In 2015, after an evaluation of the first user guide to the SME definition, the Commission published an updated version.   background   SMEs represent 99 % of all businesses in the EU. They are the backbone of its economy. They generate 2 out of every 3 jobs. In 2013, over 21 million SMEs provided almost 90 million jobs throughout the EU. They stimulate a sense of entrepreneurship and innovation, helping to foster European competitiveness, economic growth and employment.    What is an SME?

   Structural policy reform     Structural policy reform     The building of Europe is creating a group of States that are forging close economic links and regulating issues of common interest together. However, the concept of European Union integration can only be considered credible if these States maintain a sufficient level of economic and social cohesion.     With this in mind, the structural policy provisions of the Agenda 2000 package aim to meet successfully two challenges:      firstly, to improve the effectiveness of the structural policy instruments so that economic and social cohesion can be achieved;       secondly, to ensure that structural policy plays a continuing role in the Union's future enlargement, bringing in the countries of central and eastern Europe.      Harmonious development has been one of the objectives of the European Economic Community since 1957. In the beginning, the common market was established to ensure the development of the Member States and to overcome the development gaps between certain regions. The Treaty provided for the creation of a       European Social Fund      (ESF), intended to promote employment and encourage worker mobility within the Community. Given the strong growth and low unemployment in the 1950s and 60s, the Fund had a limited role at the time.     The economic shock of 1973 and the economic restructuring that led from it highlighted development gaps between some Member States. These regional disparities increased significantly with the accession of the United Kingdom and Ireland, then Greece, Spain and Portugal.     The introduction of a genuine structural policy to lessen the gaps in development and living standards became a necessity. In addition to the European Social Fund measures, other "Structural" Funds were introduced over the years, each one with a specific target. Thus, the Community created the       European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund      (EAGGF) to finance the common agricultural policy, the       European Regional Development Fund      (ERDF), assistance from which relates specifically to the regions whose development is lagging behind, and the       Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance      (FIFG).     Alongside the Structural Funds, a       Cohesion Fund      has likewise existed since 1993. It finances transport and environment infrastructure in the Member States whose gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is less than 90 % of the Union average (Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal)     The concept of economic cohesion was introduced in the Single European Act (1986), and since the Treaty on European Union (1992) it constitutes one of the three pillars of the European Community, alongside the single market and European economic union. Cohesion is still a priority today, and this is reflected in the budget: structural policy is the second most heavily funded sector in the Union after the common agricultural policy.     The structural measures and the adoption of national macroeconomic programmes to fulfil the criteria laid down for Economic and Monetary Union have resulted in the clear convergence of the Member States' economies for close on ten years now. Thus, the Union's four poorest countries (Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal) have improved economically, the most impressive example being undoubtedly Ireland, which has seen its per capita GDP increase from 64 % of the Community average in 1983 to nearly 90 % in 1995 and 118 % in 2001. Such success at national level should not blind us however to the persistence, and indeed exacerbation in some cases, of disparities in living standards between some regions of the Union.     While continuing the current elements of structural policy, the 1999 reform aims:      to improve the effectiveness of the structural instruments by strengthening concentration through a reduction in both the structural policy objectives and the Community Initiatives, by improving management and by clarifying the share-out of responsibilities between the various parties involved (A);       to maintain the budget for economic and social cohesion (B);       to extend efforts on regional cohesion to the future Member States (C).       IMPROVING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE STRUCTURAL POLICY INSTRUMENTS       The Structural Funds      The rules governing the Structural Funds are to be found in a Regulation laying down       general provisions on the Structural Funds      , added to which there are specific Regulations for each Fund.     In general terms, the 1999 reform has       increased the concentration      of assistance, but has also moved towards the       simplification      and       decentralisation      of its management. On the other hand, the reform introduces a clearer division of responsibilities and stricter application of the principle of subsidiarity.     Concentration has been increased by reducing the number of Objectives from 7 to 3 priority Objectives:       Objective 1        promotes the development and structural adjustment of regions whose development is lagging behind, i.e. whose average per capita GDP is below 75 % of the European Union average. The new Objective also covers the most remote regions (the French overseas départements, the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands) as well as the areas eligible under the former Objective 6 created pursuant to the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden. As was previously the case, two thirds of the Structural Fund operations come under Objective 1. Almost 20 % of the Union's total population should benefit from the measures taken under this Objective;        Objective 2        contributes to the economic and social conversion of regions in structural difficulties other than those eligible for the new Objective 1. This Objective brings together the former Objectives 2 and 5(b) and other areas facing the need for economic diversification: overall it will cover areas undergoing economic change, declining rural areas, depressed areas dependent on fisheries and urban areas in difficulty. No more than 18 % of the Union's population will be covered by this Objective;        Objective 3        gathers together all the measures for human resource development outside the regions eligible for Objective 1. This Objective carries over the former Objectives 3 and 4. It is the reference framework for all the measures taken under the new Title on employment in the Treaty of Amsterdam and under the European Employment Strategy.      Transitional arrangements were introduced for the regions which were eligible for Objectives 1, 2 or 5(b) between 1994 and 1999 but which will not be eligible for Objectives 1 and 2 in the period 2000-06.     Furthermore, the new Regulations provide for a reduction in the number of Community Initiatives from 13 to 4. The new Initiatives are:       INTERREG III        , which aims to stimulate cross-border, trans-national and inter-regional cooperation;        LEADER+        , which promotes rural development through the initiatives of local action groups;        EQUAL        , which provides for the development of new ways of combating all forms of discrimination and inequality as regards access to the labour market;        URBAN II        , which encourages the economic and social regeneration of towns, cities and suburbs in crisis.      Within this definition of the Objectives and Community Initiatives, each of the four Structural Funds fulfils a specific role.     The       ERDF      is intended to reduce the regional imbalances in the Community. The Fund grants financial assistance for the development of the less-favoured regions. To this end, it contributes to the new Objectives 1 and 2 and to the INTERREG and Urban Community Initiatives. In terms of financial resources, the ERDF is by far the most important Structural Fund.     The       ESF      is the Community's primary social policy instrument. It funds training, vocational retraining and job creation measures. The emphasis will henceforth be put on improving the way labour markets operate and on getting the unemployed back into jobs. It contributes to all three Objectives but its primary target is the new Objective 3. It also funds the Equal Initiative. In addition, the new Regulation strengthens the ESF's role in the Community's social policy through its participation in action undertaken in the context of the European Employment Strategy and the guidelines for employment policies.     The 1999 reform maintains the       FIFG      's dual contribution to regional development policy and the common fisheries policy. The structural measures in the fisheries sector fall within the common fisheries policy, or are even considered a sectoral policy instrument.     The EAGGF is divided into two Sections:      the         Guarantee Section        's main purpose is to fund expenditure arising from the common organisation of the markets and agricultural prices, rural development measures accompanying market support and rural measures outside Objective 1 regions, expenditure on certain veterinary measures and information measures relating to the CAP;       the         Guidance Section        funds other rural development expenditure not funded by the Guarantee Section, including the LEADER+ Initiative.      The new regulations rationalise and simplify rural development policy as regards:      the eligible rural development measures (accompanying measures such as agro-environmental measures, early retirement assistance for farmers, modernisation and diversification of farm holdings through such things as farm investment, the installation of young farmers, additional aid for forestry, etc.);       programming in the context of the measures under Objectives 1 and 2, and the new rural development programmes;       the source of funding, which is either the EAGGF Guidance Section or the Guarantee Section, depending on the regional context in which the measure is set.      The       Cohesion Fund      This Fund has been maintained as part of the reform of the Community's structural policy; it continues to cover environment and transport infrastructure. Some changes have been made, however, to simplify its operation and to strengthen the Member States' role in its financial control.     The conditions for assistance from the Cohesion Fund, whereby macroeconomic criteria have to be met, have been amended slightly. Henceforth, if the public deficit criterion is not met, funding will not be suspended, as used to be the case.     Moreover, the new provisions on project financing encourage the use of additional private funding and better application of the "polluter pays" principle.     Halfway through the next period (2003) eligibility will be rechecked against the 90 % of GNP criterion. Should a Member State no longer be eligible, the funds allocated to the Cohesion Fund will be reduced accordingly.      CONTINUING THE FUNDING EFFORT ON ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COHESION      To maintain economic and social cohesion as one of the Union's priority objectives, the       Interinstitutional Agreement      between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission of 6 May 1999 on budget discipline and improvement of the budget procedure for the 2000-06 financial perspective maintains the funding for economic and social cohesion at 0.46 % of the Union's GNP for the period 2000-06 (as was already the case in the period 1993-99).     The total appropriation for the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund stands at EUR 213 billion, broken down by year as follows:      (in million euro, 1999 prices)          Year             2000             2001             2002             2003             2004             2005             2006             Structural measures             32 045             31 455             30 865             30 285             29 595             29 595             29 170             Structural Funds             29 430             28 840             28 250             27 670             27 080             27 080             26 660             Cohesion Fund             2 615             2 615             2 615             2 615             2 515             2 515             2 510          Structural Funds appropriation      The total appropriation for the Structural Funds, including transitional assistance, the Community Initiatives and innovative actions amounts to EUR 195 billion.     The breakdown between the three Objectives is as follows:      69.7 % of the total allocation goes to Objective 1, i.e. EUR 135.9 billion;       11.5 % of the total goes to Objective 2, i.e. EUR 22.5 billion;       12.3 % of the total goes to Objective 3, i.e. EUR 24.05 billion;       0.5 % of the total goes to the FIFG outside Objective 1, i.e. EUR 1.1 billion.      The balance is earmarked for the Community Initiatives (5.35 %), for innovative actions and for technical assistance (0.65 %).      Cohesion Fund appropriation      The total available funding for commitments under the Cohesion Fund amounts to EUR 18 billion for the period 2000-06.      EXTENDING THE STRUCTURAL POLICY TO THE FUTURE MEMBER STATES      The Union's       enlargement      to include several central and eastern European countries as well as Cyprus will raise very serious problems for economic and social cohesion, given the considerable development lag in their regions compared to the current 15 Member States. Enlargement will increase the Union's diversity, posing some problems of adjustment for both regions and sectors; this will require adequate preparation.     Several conditions need to met if the structural policy is to cope efficiently with enlargement. To achieve this, the candidate countries must have time to adjust to the workings of the structural measures. The pre-accession strategy must therefore be strengthened so that, from 2000 on, pre-accession assistance is available.     Various instruments will contribute to this aim. Firstly, the       Phare      programme, which aids the countries of central and eastern Europe, recently underwent a policy change and has a budget from now on of EUR 10.92 billion for pre-accession assistance between 2000 and 2006.       ISPA      (the Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-accession), finances projects in the environment and transport sectors and has a budget of EUR 7.28 billion.       Sapard      another financial instrument for agriculture has EUR 3.64 billion.     After accession, the Structural Funds programmes and the Cohesion Fund projects will replace pre-accession assistance, due regard being taken to each country's capacity to absorb this funding.     RELATED ACTS      Commission Communication to the European Parliament and Council of 6 September 2004 on the respective responsibilities of Member States and the Commission in the shared management of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. Current situation and outlook for the new programming period after 2006. [         COM(2004) 580        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      This communication fulfils the commitment given by the Commission in its "Summary of Annual Activity Reports 2002 of DGs and Services" to perform a legal analysis of its responsibilities and those of the Member States in jointly managing the EU budget and clarify the procedures through which, in cooperation with the Member States, it can discharge its general responsibility for implementing the budget.     In the first part (Section II), the Commission sets out its interpretation of the current rules governing the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund in order to clarify the shared management responsibilities of each party. In its view, these rules allow its obligations regarding budget implementation to be reconciled with the specific features of the Union's cohesion policy and its management system. Under this system, according to the Council Regulations, the Member States are responsible in the first instance for managing, monitoring and day-to-day financial control of the resources disbursed by the Funds. The existing structure includes arrangements which allow the Commission to discharge its general responsibility by ensuring that the required management and control systems actually exist and operate properly. If subsequent Commission audits detect any deficiencies in these systems, it determines the likely amounts of ineligible expenditure that were financed and applies suitable financial corrections. This communication sets out the measures taken by the Commission to comply with these provisions.     The second purpose of the communication (Section III) is to set out the general guidelines followed by the Commission in drawing up the legislative proposals it adopted on 14 July 2004 for the 2007-13 period. These proposals were designed to make the overall structure of the implementation system more consistent, complementary and efficient, and included clarifying the obligations on Member States to cooperate and the consequences for them of infringing the rules.      Proposal for a Council Regulation of 14 July 2004 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund [         COM(2004) 492        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      In July 2004, the Commission presented a package of proposals for reforming regional policy after 1 January 2007. The basis of the reform is set out in the general provisions given in this document, which accompanies the other specific documents for the two Structural Funds (ERDF and ESF), the Cohesion Fund and the new European grouping of cross-border cooperation.     The Commission proposes focussing funding on a limited number of Community priorities that reflect the Lisbon (employment) and Gothenburg (environment) agendas. For operational programmes, a limited list of key themes has been drawn up: innovation and the knowledge economy, environment and risk prevention, accessibility and services of general economic interest. The key principles remain programming, partnership, part-financing and evaluation.     The aim is to promote balanced and sustainable economic and social development throughout the Community. Community action seeks to meet the challenges posed by economic, social and spatial disparities, accelerating economic restructuring and ageing populations.     The main change is that objectives 1, 2 and 3 have been replaced by three new priorities: "Convergence", "Regional competitiveness and employment" and "Territorial cooperation".

   Action plan on language learning and linguistic diversity     Action plan on language learning and linguistic diversity     The purpose of this action plan is to promote language learning and linguistic diversity. It defines specific objectives and a set of actions to be implemented between 2004 and 2006.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 24 July 2003 - Promoting language learning and linguistic diversity: an action plan 2004-2006 [       COM(2003) 449      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     In the European Union (EU) more than 500 million Europeans come from diverse ethnic, cultural and linguistic backgrounds and it is now more important than ever that citizens have the skills necessary to understand and communicate with their neighbours. All European citizens should be able to communicate in at least two languages other than their mother tongue.      Role of the European Union and the Member States      In accordance with the ‘principle of subsidiarity’ each EU Member State is fully responsible for organising its educational systems as well as the content of the programmes.     The Union's role in this field is not to replace action by Member States, but to support and supplement it. However, the EU has put in place numerous actions designed to promote language education and learning under the framework of Community programmes, particularly in the areas of education, culture, the audiovisual sector, and the media.      Objectives and actions      The action plan identifies three broad areas for action and defines specific objectives for each of them.     The first area of action is       life-long language learning      . For this area the action plan identifies the following specific objectives:      learning a mother tongue plus two other languages from a very early age;       continuing language learning in secondary education and vocational training;       continuing language learning in higher education;       encouraging language learning among adults;       developing language learning for persons with special needs;       widening the range of languages offered in education.      The second area of action aims at       improving language teaching      , specifically through a more adaptable school structure. In this context, the action plan identifies the following specific objectives:      implementing global language learning policies in schools;       disseminating more widely the tools developed for teaching and learning languages;       improving the training for language teachers;       increasing the supply of language teachers;       training teachers so that they can teach their subjects in at least one other foreign language;       testing the language skills of citizens using a         European Indicator of Language Competence        and facilitating comparison between these skills.      The third area of action involves       creating a language-friendly environment      . To this end, the action plan identifies the following specific objectives:      promoting an inclusive approach to linguistic diversity;       creating language-friendly communities, through the use of sub-titles in cinemas, for example, or by capitalising on the skills of the many bilingual citizens;       improving the supply and take-up of language learning.      In order to achieve these objectives, the action plan proposes       actions to be taken at European level      for each of them, aimed at supplementing Member States’ initiatives. These actions will be carried out between 2004 and 2006.     The action plan also includes the creation of a framework for achieving these objectives through structures that enable better-informed decisions (a high-level group, undertaking studies, etc.), more effective sharing of information amongst practitioners, and clear procedures for the follow-up of the action plan.      Overall budget and monitoring of action plan      The overall budget for 2004-2006 is EUR 8 200 million to be shared between the       Socrates      ,       Leonardo da Vinci      and       MEDIA Plus      programmes.     In 2007, Member States will present to the Commission a report on the implementation of the action plan.      Context      The       European Year of Languages      organised in 2001 highlighted the many ways of promoting language learning and linguistic diversity. The action plan follows a request from the Council and is the result of in a wide public consultation involving the European institutions, relevant national ministries, a wide range of organisations representing civil society, and the general public.     RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 18 September 2008 –         Multilingualism: an asset for Europe and a shared commitment        [COM(2008) 566 final – Not published in the Official Journal].       Commission report of 25 September 2007 on the implementation of the Action Plan 'Promoting language learning and linguistic diversity' [         COM(2007) 554        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      The Commission and the Member States have made substantial progress in implementing this Action Plan. Of the 47 actions, 41 will be completed by the end of 2007. On the basis of the national reports on the monitoring of the Action Plan, the Commission considers that it has influenced the national language policy reforms and made it possible to attach more political importance to promoting language learning, linguistic diversity and multilingualism in general. Seventeen actions aimed at improving the promotion of language learning have been implemented under several European programmes, mainly Socrates and Leonardo. This support will have a lasting effect, as the       new generation of programmes for 2007-2013      puts the emphasis on promoting language learning and linguistic diversity. However, the report refers to the additional efforts that need to be made to implement the national reforms from the point of view of the quality of language teaching and teacher training in this field. Emphasis should also be placed on widening the range of languages taught.     See also       The European Commission website dedicated to languages       Last updated: 13.09.2011  
act   Regulation (EC) No  998/2003  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals and amending Council Directive  92/65/EEC  [  See amending act(s)  ].   summary   This Regulation harmonises the health requirements applicable to pet animals which are moved within the European Union (EU) for non-commercial reasons. It also reinforces the standards applicable to animals coming in from third countries.  This Regulation aims to guarantee a high level of protection for human and animal health while facilitating movements of pet animals accompanied by their owners.   Animals concerned   This Regulation deals with:   dogs,   cats,   ferrets,   invertebrates (except bees and crustaceans),   ornamental tropical fish,   amphibians,   reptiles,   birds (except poultry which are covered by Directives  2009/158/EC  and  92/65/EEC  ),   rodents, and   domestic rabbits.   However, the health requirements applicable to these animals are not harmonised. The national rules prevail.  This Regulation applies without prejudice to the  provisions on species of wild fauna and flora  .   Identification of animals   Cats, dogs and ferrets must be identified by means of an electronic chip (transponder) or a clearly readable tattoo. As from 3 July 2011, transponders will be the only accepted means of identification.  The transponder is already recognised as the only valid means of identification in Ireland, Malta and United Kingdom.   Movements of pet animals between Member States   Animals travelling, accompanied by their owner, within the European Union must be accompanied by a passport issued by a veterinarian authorised by the competent authority in their Member State of origin.  The passport of the animals (cats, dogs and ferrets) must certify that the animal complies with the health requirements detailed below and, in the case of Finland, Ireland, Malta, Sweden and the United Kingdom, with the additional national rules required by these countries.  Entry of pet animals (cats, dogs and ferrets) into the territory of a Member State is subject to compliance with the following three conditions:   the animal must have a system of identification (transponder or tattoo);   the animal must be validly vaccinated against rabies;   the animal must comply, if necessary, with certain preventive health measures concerning diseases other than rabies.   For a transitory period up until 31 December 2011, entry of pet animals (dogs or cats) into the territory of Ireland, Malta, Sweden and the United Kingdom is subject to compliance with the following additional conditions:   the animal must have undergone a neutralising antibody titration (a test aimed at checking the efficacy of the vaccine) in a  laboratory approved  by the European Commission and following the protocol in force in these Member States;   the animal must be treated against ticks (except for Sweden) and tapeworm echinococciosis (this treatment is also required for Sweden) following the protocol in force in these Member States.   In addition, Member States may authorise entry to young animals under three months old and unvaccinated under certain conditions.   Movements of pet animals from third countries   The health rules applicable to intra-Community movements of pet animals also apply to the following countries: Andorra, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway, San Marino, Switzerland and the Vatican. They also apply to the third countries listed in Annex II, Part C.  Stricter health rules apply to animals (cats, dogs and ferrets) coming from a third country not listed in Part C of Annex II. If they enter Member States other than Ireland, Malta, Sweden and the United Kingdom, these animals must be vaccinated and have undergone a neutralising antibody titration (for Finland treatment against tapeworm echinococcosis is also required until 31 December 2011). The titration must be carried out in a laboratory approved by the European Commission on a blood sample taken at least one month after the vaccination and three months before the movement of the animal.  If they enter Ireland, Malta, Sweden or the United Kingdom, placing in quarantine is foreseen in accordance with the protocol in force in those Member States.  Animals coming from third countries must be accompanied by a certificate issued by an official veterinarian or a passport in the case of reintroduction, certifying that the health rules of this Regulation have been complied with.   Penalties   Where checks, particularly those performed at EU entry points, reveal that an animal does not satisfy the requirements of this Regulation, the authority responsible may decide to return the animal to its country of origin, to isolate it under official supervision for the time necessary to bring it into line with health requirements or, as a last resort, to put the animal down where its return or isolation in quarantine cannot be envisaged.  Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 is repealed by Regulation (EU) No 576/2013 with effect from 28.12.2014.

summary of   White Paper (COM(2007) 279 final) on nutrition-, overweight- and obesity-related health issues   what is the aim of this white paper   The  European Commission  sets out an integrated EU approach towards reducing ill health due to poor nutrition, overweight and obesity.   It focuses on proposing actions that can be taken at local, regional, national and EU levels by a variety of partners to tackle this  public health  problem. These actions complement and support existing measures in EU countries.   It takes specific account of the socio-economic dimension of the obesity issue because of its association with more disadvantaged groups in society.   key points    The primary aim of the strategy is to  fight the obesogenic environment  (i.e. an environment that promotes weight gain) and help citizens  reduce high-risk behaviours  , such as poor nutrition and lack of exercise, that lead to overweight and obesity.   It sets out to achieve this by focusing on  actions  that:   enable consumers to make informed choices to ensure that healthy options are available, e.g. in supermarkets and canteens;   encourage the involvement of the private sector;   the food industry (including retailers) could reformulate its product recipes, in particular by reducing levels of salt, sugar and fats, and reduce and target its marketing so that it does not inappropriately target children and so that it promotes healthier options;   employers could encourage healthy lifestyles (e.g. walking or cycling to work);   motivate people to undertake regular physical activity by stressing the health benefits.      Partnerships    The strategy emphasises the importance of building up  partnerships  across the EU to take action on the ground, i.e. at local, regional and national levels, as well as at EU level. These involve the private sector (e.g. food manufacturers, retail and the advertising industry), the public health sector and  civil society organisations  (e.g. sports, consumer and public health associations) working together.   Building on the  EU platform for action on diet, physical activity and health  launched in 2005, the strategy proposes that similar platforms be created at national and subnational levels in EU countries. The involvement of  local stakeholders  (e.g. associations and small businesses) is key to the success of the strategy because it creates a group dynamic and links as many players as possible and at all levels.   EU countries’ authorities are responsible for:    coordinating  so as to ensure the relevance of the measures in the field of public health; and   encouraging the  media  to take part in developing common messages and campaigns.     The  High Level Group on Nutrition and Physical Activity  (HLG), composed of representatives of EU countries plus Norway and Switzerland, promotes the exchange of good practices and information and develops voluntary common approaches.   The HLG has been involved in the reformulation of food products, notably with regard to  salt  ,  saturated fat  and  added sugars  . In 2011, it agreed on an  EU Framework for National Initiatives on Selected Nutrients  (based on the model of a 2008 reformulation to reduce salt in food by 16% in 4 years). Work then started on reducing saturated fat by 5% up to 2016 and by an additional 5% by 2020. In 2015, work started on the added sugars annex to promote a voluntary reduction of 10% in added sugars in processed food by 2020.   In 2016, the HLG agreed on a monitoring system for national reformulation initiatives, which was an important milestone and a concrete step to support national action. These efforts will ultimately benefit citizens each time they shop at the supermarket. The results of the ongoing joint action on nutrition and physical activity will also support this effort, and more developments are expected in 2017.   In 2014, the HLG adopted the  EU action plan on childhood obesity 2014-2020  , which aims to halt the rise of childhood obesity by 2020. A mid-term evaluation is being conducted.   In 2017, the HLG participated in the drafting and agreement of public procurement guidelines for school food.    Interdisciplinary approach    Although  public health  is at the core of the issue, the strategy, in addition to its emphasis on partnerships at all levels, highlights the fact that the fight against overweight and obesity requires a  concerted approach  involving a  number of policy sectors  . Examples include the following.    Education:  developing information campaigns for both children and adults.    Consumer policy:  providing clear and comprehensive information on food choices, e.g.  nutritional labelling  .    Marketing:  the  Audiovisual Media Services Directive  encourages responsible marketing of foods, particularly to children.    Sport:  making organised sports activities more accessible and encouraging  greater participation in physical activity  .    Urban planning and active mobility:  encouraging ‘active transport and commuting’, e.g. walking, cycling and using public transport.    Research:  finding out more about the determinants of food and physical activity choices, in particular in the context of EU (  Horizon 2020  ) and national research-funding mechanisms.    Agriculture:  making healthier options more affordable and available for all population groups, especially children.    European Parliament:   pilot projects  that support healthy diets in population groups are implemented by the Commission DG Health and Food Safety.      International cooperation   The Commission has been working closely with the  World Health Organisation  on creating reference documents and a common repository on nutrition and physical activity.   Monitoring and evaluating policies    Data on obesity and overweight are monitored at:    macro level  , to obtain coherent and comparable data on universal indicators of progress in the context of the  European Core Health Indicators  associated with diet and physical activity;    country level  , to assess the current activities and their impact;   the level of the  individual actions  .     Activities are systematically evaluated for their impact to identify those that work well.    Follow-up   Policy work on reducing overweight and obesity in Europe continues to focus on priority areas such as:   reducing the dietary intake of salt, saturated fat, trans fats and added sugars;   increasing the intake of fruit and vegetables;   reducing the exposure to and impact of foods high in salt, saturated fat, trans fats and added sugars on children;   public procurement of foods;   increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviour;   increasing the rate of exclusive breastfeeding during the first 6 months;   reducing inequalities in diet and physical activity between population groups.   background    Poor diet and physical inactivity directly affect life expectancy and quality for millions of citizens as well as the efficiency and sustainability of health systems. Up to 7% of EU health budgets are each year spent on diseases linked to obesity. Additional costs result from loss of productivity due to health problems and premature death (2.8 million deaths per year from causes associated with overweight and obesity).   52% of EU adults are overweight or obese and 17% are obese. Obesity in adults is a known risk factor of a number of serious chronic diseases including type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some cancers and is a preventable cause of premature death.   Childhood obesity is a particular worry. 1 in 3 children in the EU aged 6-9 years is now overweight or obese. This is a significant increase from 2008, when 1 in 4 children was overweight or obese. Children who are overweight or obese are highly likely to remain so in adulthood. Obese children are more likely to suffer from bullying, self-confidence issues, depression and under-achievement in school.

summary of   Regulation (EU) 2018/848 — rules on organic production and labelling of organic products   what is the aim of the regulation  It aims to revise and strengthen the  EU  ’s rules concerning organic production and the labelling or organic products in relation to:   the control system;   the trade regime;   production rules.   In this way, it seeks to:   create a level playing field for operators;   harmonise and simplify rules;   improve consumers’ confidence in organic products and in the EU’s organic production logo.   key points   The regulation  broadens the scope  of the existing legislation on the  production and labelling of organic products  (Regulation (EC) No 834/2007) to cover products closely linked to agriculture such as cork, salt, essential oils, cotton or wool.  It reviews the livestock organic production rules taking into account the experience gained and introduces production requirements for new species such as rabbits.   Principles   Organic production should:   respect natural systems and cycles and maintain and improve the state of soil, water and air, plant and animal health, and the balance among them;   preserve the elements of natural landscapes;   use  energy  and natural resources responsibly;   produce a wide variety of high-quality products to meet consumer demand;   ensure the integrity of organic production at all stages of the production, processing and distribution processes of food and animal feed;   exclude the use of  genetically modified organisms  (GMOs)  *  , products produced  from or by GMOs   *  , other than veterinary drugs;   restrict the use of external inputs;   design and manage biological processes using methods based on risk assessment and the use of precautionary and preventive measures;   exclude animal cloning;   ensure a high level of  animal welfare  .    Requirements   Among other things,  organic farming  must:   maintain and enhance soil life and its natural fertility, stability, water retention capacity and biodiversity;   use seeds and animals with a high degree of genetic diversity, disease resistance and longevity;   choose plant varieties, taking into account the characteristics of specific organic production systems, focusing on agronomic performance and disease resistance;   choose animal breeds to take into account their genetic value, longevity, vitality and resistance to diseases or health problems;   practise site-adapted and land-related breeding.    Production   To avoid adverse effects on the  environment  and on animal and plant health, producers must:   take preventive measures at each stage of production, preparation and distribution to   preserve biodiversity and soil quality   prevent the occurrence of pests and diseases   control these pests and diseases;     take proportionate and precautionary measures to avoid contamination with products or substances not authorised for use in organic production.    Conversion period   When a farm wishes to produce organic products, it has to go through a conversion period during which it must be managed according to organic production rules, although its products at this stage are not considered to be organic. It can only place its products on the market as organic products once this conversion period has elapsed and has been checked.  Following the conversion period, any EU farm wishing to move to organic production must be fully managed in line with organic production requirements.  The regulation also allows mixed farms (i.e. non-organic, in-conversion and organic) provided that these activities are clearly and genuinely separated.   Certification   Operators (producers, processors and distributors) must notify their activities to the competent authorities to become officially certified that they comply with the organic production and labelling rules.  The regulation introduces a new system of  group certification for small farmers  making it easier for them to switch to organic farming.   Official controls and labelling   The control system is strengthened by means of stricter precautionary measures and more robust risk-based controls of the supply chain. There are  on-the-spot checks  on operators once a year or every 2 years if no fraud has been detected over the previous 3 years.  If a control body suspects an operator of trying to place a non-authorised product on the market as ‘organic’, it must formally investigate and temporarily ban the placing on the market of that product pending the investigation’s outcome. In the event of serious or repeated infringements, operators may be prohibited from selling products described as organic for a given period or may have their certificate withdrawn.  Specific controls on organic farming will be complemented by the EU’s  general rules on official controls along the agri-food chain  .   Imports   A product may be imported from a non-EU country to be sold in the EU as an organic product if certain conditions are met. It must:   comply with production and control rules of the non-EU country recognised under an international agreement as equivalent to those in the EU;   have a certificate issued by the relevant control authorities or control bodies in non-EU countries confirming the product complies with EU standards.   from when does the regulation apply  It applies from 1 January 2021. As of 31 December 2020, it replaces and repeals Regulation (EC) No 834/2007.   background   For more information, see:    Organic farming  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Genetically modified organisms (GMOs):  plants or animals bred by modifying their cellular and genetic make-up, for example, to have higher yield or to resist disease.   Products produced from or by GMOs:     (a)    products produced  from  GMOs are derived in whole or in part from GMOs, but do not themselves contain or consist of GMOs (e.g. potatoes produced from GMO seed potatoes);      (b)    products produced  by  GMOs are derived using a GMO as the last living organism in the production process, but do not themselves contain, or consist of GMOs, nor are they produced from GMOs (e.g. sugar and starch manufactured from a GMO vegetable source).
summary of   Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 on unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms   summary    what does the regulation do  The regulation establishes a unique identifier*, similar to a barcode, specific to each genetically modified organism* (  GMO  ) brought to market. This is a key element in the  traceability* and labelling  of  food and animal feed derived from GMOs  , aiming to improve consumer choice and provide safeguards to health and the environment.   key points   For consistency with developments in international fora, a unique identifier format is used by the  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development BioTrack  database and by the  Biosafety Clearing-House  of the  Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity  .  For each new application for the  authorisation  of a GMO to be put on the market, the applicant must check in the databases to make sure that an identifier has not already been assigned before creating a unique identifier in the prescribed format.  Where authorisation is granted for a GMO to be put on the market, the unique identifier is then communicated to the Biosafety Clearing-House by the  European Commission  and recorded in the  EU register of authorised GMOs  .  All GMOs authorised before the regulation came into force have been assigned unique identifiers under the regulation.  The format of the unique identifier is defined in the annex to the regulation, and consists of nine alphanumeric digits. The first two or three digits represent the company or organisation name. The second component of five or six digits represents the transformation event* and the final component is a single verification digit, all separated by a dash, for example: MON-00603-1.   from when does the regulation apply  It applies from 16 January 2004.   background   For more information, see  ‘Traceability and labelling’  on the European Commission’s website.   key terms    * Unique identifier  : a 9-digit alphanumeric code specific to a GMO enabling it to be readily identified on a product’s labelling.   * Genetically modified organisms  : plants or animals bred to give higher yield or resist disease, through modification of their cellular and genetic make-up.   * Traceability  : the ability to track GMOs, and products produced from GMOs, at all stages of the production and distribution chain, facilitating accurate labelling.   * Transformation event  : a term used to differentiate genetically engineered (transformed) crop varieties and other organisms.   act   Commission Regulation (EC) No  65/2004  of 14 January 2004 establishing a system for the development and assignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms (OJ L 10, 16.1.2004, pp. 5-10)
act   Council  Regulation (EU) No 558/2014  of 6 May 2014 establishing the Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking.   summary   The CS 2 JU aims to improve the environmental performance of aircraft by ensuring they are cleaner, more fuel-efficient and less noisy, as well as by helping to develop a strong and competitive aeronautics industry in Europe.  Regulation (EU) No 558/2014 covers the period until 2024. This new phase continues where the original programme left off. It involves companies, universities, public laboratories, innovative SMEs and the European Commission.  CS 2’s  targets  are:        —     increasing aircraft fuel efficiency to reduce CO  2  emissions by between 20 to 30 percent; and            —     reducing aircraft nitrogen oxide (NO  x  ) and noise emissions by between 20 to 30 percent compared to the most modern aircraft entering into service as from 2014.      CS 2 comprises:        1.     Three innovative aircraft demonstrator platforms (IADPs) for large passenger aircraft, regional aircraft and fast rotorcraft (advanced helicopters), developing and testing flying demonstrators at the full aircraft/vehicle level;            2.     Three integrated technology demonstrators (ITDs), looking at airframe, engines and systems, using demonstrators at major integrated system level;            3.     Two transverse activities (small air transport, eco-design), integrating the knowledge of different ITDs and IADPs for specific applications and enabling synergies to be exploited between different platforms through shared projects and results;            4.     The technology evaluator (TE), monitoring and assessing the environmental and societal impact of the technologies developed in the IADPs and ITDs.       Management   The CS 2 JU is a legal entity set up for the purpose under Article 187 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (which allows for PPPs at EU level in the field of industrial research). The JU sets its own strategic research agenda and funds members’ projects, as well as projects selected following calls for proposals published on  CS 2 JU’s  website. As a general rule, the JU applies the Horizon 2020 rules for participation.  CS 2 is managed by an  Executive Director  who is supported by the Clean Sky team. The JU has a  governing board  comprising the industry, research organisations and European Commission representatives. It has overall responsibility for the operations of the JU. It is advised by scientific committees on scientific priorities. There is also a CS 2 states representatives group representing the countries involved, as well as steering committees for the ITDs and IADPs. Decisions are taken in accordance with the voting rules established by the JU.  Article 209 of the  EU’s Financial Regulation  (Regulation (EU, Euratom) No  966/2012  ) provides for new lighter rules customised for EU PPP bodies.   Budget   CS 2’s overall budget is  EUR 4 billion  . EUR 1.8 billion comes from the  Horizon 2020  programme budget. Industrial partners contribute EUR 2.2 billion, EUR 1 billion of which comes through additional activities not included in the work plan of the JTI but that help meet its objectives. In order to take into account the duration of the Horizon 2020 programme, calls for proposals under CS 2 JU must be launched by 31 December 2020:        —     40 % of the budget is reserved for the CS 2 founding members who lead the technical programme and commit for the whole of its duration;            —     30 % is allocated to core partners selected through open calls at the start of the programme, which become full members of the JU;            —     the last 30 % of funding is distributed in annual open calls to support the specific tasks.      The JU also seeks to develop synergies with the  European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF)  .

   Introduction     Introduction      BACKGROUND      The Treaty of Nice, agreed by the Heads of State or Government at the Nice European Council on 11 December 2000 and signed on 26 February 2001, is the culmination of eleven months of negotiations that took place during an Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) opened in February 2000. It entered into force on 1 February 2003 after being ratified by the fifteen Member States of the European Union (EU) according to their respective constitutional rules.     The Treaty of Amsterdam made specific provisions for the IGC 2000 in its Protocol on the institutions in the context of EU enlargement. It did in fact anticipate that "at least one year before the membership of the European Union exceeds twenty, a conference of representatives of the governments of the Member States shall be convened in order to carry out a comprehensive review of the provisions of the Treaties on the composition and functioning of the institutions". Furthermore, three Member States, Belgium, France and Italy were also intent on making a Declaration stating that strengthening the institutions was an "an indispensable condition for the conclusion of the first accession negotiations".     The Cologne European Council (June 1999) confirmed the need to convene an IGC to consider the institutional issues which had not been settled in Amsterdam and which had to be resolved before enlargement.     The Helsinki European Council (December 1999) reaffirmed this mandate and decided that the IGC would look at the size and composition of the Commission, the weighting of votes in the Council, the extension of qualified-majority voting, as well as any other institutional adjustments that would have to be made to the Treaties in connection with the above issues and in the context of implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam.     This European Council's conclusions left the option of adding further items to the IGC's agenda, which the Feira European Council (June 2000) took advantage of with the addition of enhanced cooperation.     Preparation for the IGC began in October 1999 when, at the request of the Commission, the group of high level experts led by Mr Dehaene presented its report on the institutional implications of enlargement. Following this report, on 26 January 2000, the Commission presented its opinion entitled "Adapting the institutions to make a success of enlargement".     After consultation of the Commission and Parliament, whose opinions must be sought before an IGC is convened (Article 48 of the EU Treaty), the conference of Member States' government representatives opened on 14 February 2000 under the Portuguese Presidency. From July 2000 the IGC worked under the French Presidency.      OBJECTIVES OF THE TREATY OF NICE      The Intergovernmental Conference which resulted in the Treaty of Nice had the very clear mandate of preparing the European Union for enlargement by revising the Treaties in four key areas:      size and composition of the Commission;       weighting of votes in the Council;       extension of qualified-majority voting;       enhanced cooperation.       STRUCTURE OF THE TREATY      The Treaty of Nice consists of two parts and four Protocols. In addition, the IGC adopted 24 Declarations and took note of three more from different Member States which were also annexed to the Final Act.     The first part includes the most substantive amendments in the following six Articles:      Article 1 deals with the amendments made to the EU Treaty:- serious breach of EU founding principles;- common foreign and security policy (CSFP);- international agreements;- enhanced cooperation;- judicial cooperation in criminal matters.       Article 2 deals with the amendments made to the Treaty establishing the European Community:- extension of the qualified majority;- establishment of a Social Protection Committee;- the status of Members of Parliament and European Political Parties;- the Commission (composition and role of the President);- the other institutions (Court of Justice, Court of Auditors, European Economic and Social Committee, Committee of the Regions);- the European Investment Bank;- title of the Official Journal.       Article 3 deals with the amendments made to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom Treaty).       Article 4 deals with the amendments made to the treaty establishing the European Steel and Coal Community (ECSC Treaty).       Article 5 deals with the amendments made to the Protocol on the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank.       Article 6 deals with the amendments made to the Protocol on the privileges and immunities of the European Communities      Part two, which consists of Articles 7 to 13, includes the transitional and final amendments.     Lastly four       Protocols      are annexed to the Treaties:      the Protocol on the enlargement of the European Union dealing with the composition of the European Parliament and the Commission and the weighting of votes in the Council;       the Protocol on the Statute of the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance;       the Protocol on the financial consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty (European Coal and Steel Community);       the Protocol on Article 67 of the EU Treaty (administrative cooperation between the Member States' administrations over "visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to free movement of persons").       CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE TREATY      The institutional reform achieved in Nice has been described as "technical" and "limited". The Treaty does not, in fact, drastically change the institutional balance but rather makes some adjustments, mainly to the function and composition of the institutions and enhanced cooperation. In addition to the discussion on the reform of the institutions, some more unusual non-institutional topics were tackled.     In the interests of clarity this guide to the Treaty of Nice has been divided into three chapters covering the main changes that have been made.      Institutional questions       The Council of the European Union and the new weighting of votes in the Council: adjustment in the weighting of votes in favour of the more populated Member States and redistribution of votes among the 25 then 27 Member States.       The European Commission: change in the composition of the Commission, increase in the powers of the President and change in the way he or she is nominated.       Judicial System: new division of tasks between the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance and the possible creation of specialist judicial Chambers.       Other Institutions:Parliament: extension of the codecision procedure and adjustment of the number of seats allocated to each current and future Member State. The Court of Auditors, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: composition and nomination of members.       The decision-making process      Enhanced Cooperation: the Treaty of Nice has made the enhanced cooperation system more flexible (less strict conditions, removal of the right to veto, more fields of application).     Qualified-majority voting: extension of the qualified-majority decision-making process to around thirty new Articles.      Other reforms      These involve several thematic provisions relating to fundamental rights, security and defence policy, cooperation over criminal law, the status of European political parties as well as a number of provisions contained in the Declarations and Protocols annexed to the Treaty.      POST-NICE, PURSUING INSTITUTIONAL REFORM       Declaration on the future of the Union      In a       Declaration on the future of the Union      annexed to the Treaty of Nice, the intergovernmental conference called for a deeper and wider debate on the future of the European Union. The debate was to involve national parliaments and all public opinion as well as the candidate countries and lead to the convening of a new IGC in 2004.     The debate was to address four key issues in particular:      a more precise demarcation of responsibilities between the European Union and the Member States;       the status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union;       a simplification of the Treaties;       the role of national parliaments in the European architecture.       The Laeken Declaration (December 2001)      At its meeting in Laeken in December 2001 the European Council presented the agreed method for bringing about reform (a Convention) and the timetable, and defined the agenda for the debate.      The Convention      In accordance with the Laeken Declaration a Convention was organised in order to prepare for the next IGC which, like the Convention that established the Charter of fundamental rights, involved representatives from national governments and parliaments in the Member States and candidate countries and representatives from the European Parliament and the Commission. Its inaugural session was held on 28 February 2002 and work came to an end after 17 months of discussions.     The Convention drew up a draft Treaty establishing a European Constitution which was presented by its President, Mr Giscard d'Estaing, to the Thessaloniki European Council. The Convention concluded is work in July 2003.      The Intergovernmental Conference and the draft Constitution      The draft Constitution, the result of the Convention's work, served as a basis for the negotiations at the IGC convened in October 2003. After a political agreement was reached on 18 June 2004, building on the work of the IGC, the draft Constitution was forwarded to the Heads of State and Government, all of whom signed it on 29 October 2004.     The ratification of the Constitution was the final stage prior to its entry into force. It had to be ratified by all the Member States in accordance with each one's constitutional rules, namely either parliamentary ratification or referendum.     Following the difficulties in ratifying the Treaty in some Member States, the Heads of State and Government decided, at the European Council meeting on 16 and 17 June 2005, to launch a "period of reflection" on the future of Europe.      The Treaty of Lisbon      At the European Council meeting on 21 and 22 June 2007, European leaders reached a compromise and agreed to convene an IGC to finalise and adopt, not a Constitution, but a reform treaty for the European Union. The final text of the treaty, drawn up by the IGC, was approved at the informal European Council in Lisbon on 18 and 19 October. The       Treaty of Lisbon      was signed by the Member States on 13 December 2007.      The Treaty of Nice modified by the accession treaties      When the Treaty of Nice was being drawn up, it was not known when and in what order the candidate countries would join the Union. The Treaty of Nice was therefore confined to setting out the principles and methods for changing the composition of the Commission and redefining the qualified majority in the Council. Thus, as anticipated in the Protocol on enlargement and the Declarations annexed to the Treaty, the allocation of Parliamentary seats and Council votes to the new Member States and the qualified majority threshold applicable in the future were determined legally in their accession treaties. The Treaty of Accession of the ten new Member States, signed in Athens on 16 April 2003, and the Treaty of Luxembourg on the accession of Romania and Bulgaria, signed on 25 April 2005, thus lay down the rules in this area. Since 1 January 2007 the foundation of the Union has therefore been the EU and EC Treaties as last amended by the Treaties of Nice, Athens and Luxembourg.     Last updated: 11.01.2008  
summary of   Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 on the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and the traceability of food and feed products produced from GMOs   summary    what does the regulation do  It puts in place rules to ensure products containing  GMOs  * and  food and animal feed  derived from them can be  traced at all stages of the production and distribution chain  .  The rules cover labelling, monitoring environmental and health risks, and the ability to withdraw products where necessary.   key points    Traceability   Traceability (the ability to track GMOs and products produced from GMOs at all stages of the production and distribution chain) is key in providing consumers and the food trade with information and safeguards about food/feed derived from GMOs. It allows them to make informed choices based on accurate labelling.  There are  3 main requirements for sellers  :   inform trade buyers in writing that a product contains GMOs (or provide a ‘declaration of use’ for products intended for food or  animal feed  ).   communicate the  unique identifiers  assigned to each GMO under the regulation.   (for food and feed) identify each ingredient produced from GMOs, if an ingredients list exists.   This information should be  provided at every stage  in the production and distribution chain and  kept for 5 years  .   Labelling   Final consumer packaging or pre-packaged products containing GMOs should be labelled: ‘  This product contains genetically modified organisms [or the names of the organisms]  ’.   Inspection and checks   EU countries must carry out inspections, sample checks and tests, to ensure the rules on GMO labelling are followed.  Each country must also impose effective penalties for infringements. Products can be withdrawn if they have unforeseen adverse effects on health or the environment.  The national authorities are given  technical guidance  by the  European Commission  . The Commission keeps a  central register of GMO reference material  , used to detect GMOs authorised in the EU, as well as information on unauthorised GMOs.   Exemptions    A product may contain  traces  of GMOs (below 0.9 %), if this is technically unavoidable.   The regulation does not apply to  medicinal products  .   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 7 November 2003.   background   For more information, see  Traceability and labelling – EU rules  .   key term    * Genetically modified organisms  – plants or animals bred to have higher yield or to resist disease, by modifying their cellular and genetic make-up.   act   Regulation (EC) No  1830/2003  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC (OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, pp. 24-28)  Successive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 have been incorporated into the original text.

   European development and external assistance policy: 2009 Report     European development and external assistance policy: 2009 Report     The Commission presents a report on action carried out by the EU in 2009 concerning development aid for third countries. In the context of food and economic crises, the European Union took concrete and rapid measures to support its partners. It is to continue its efforts to increase the effectiveness of its aid and the coherency of its policies in order to meet global development goals with its partners.     ACT     Report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament - Annual Report 2010 on the European Union's development and external assistance policies and their implementation in 2009 [       COM(2010) 335      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     In 2009, European Union (EU) cooperation activities with third countries took place in a       difficult context      . Developing countries had to face the economic and financial crisis and rising food prices.     The EU reacted quickly, creating a       financial facility      to improve production of and access to food. It also created an instrument to combat vulnerability – FLEX – to support public expenditure in the most vulnerable countries. Furthermore, the EU has established an instrument to finance the adaptation of these countries to climate change.      International relations      Existing relationships with several global regions were strengthened in 2009, particularly in the course of:       strategic summits        on development, held with India, China and Russia;       the adoption of a         new strategic framework for Latin America        and an Investment Facility;       the launch of negotiations to         revise the Cotonou Agreement        with ACP countries, and the mid-term review of the European Development Fund (EDF);       the strengthening of         dialogue with South Africa        on peace and security;       the holding of the         EU-Pakistan summit        ;       the conclusion of the first         partnership agreement with Iraq        ;       the implementation of the         European Neighbourhood Policy        (ENP) and its investment facility.       Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)      Some progress has been made since the adoption of the MDGs in 2000, but some countries are significantly behind, particularly due to the international context in 2008 and 2009. The EU intends to adopt a global approach to accelerate progress with a view to meeting the MDGs before 2015. It will present a joint position at the UN summit in September 2010 for the international assessment of the MDGs.      Coherence of policies with development goals      The Commission and EU countries should apply the principles of the       European Consensus on Development      and improve the coordination of their actions. The impact of European policies on development must be taken into account. The Council has identified a number of priority areas: trade and finance, climate change, food security, migration, and peace and security.     Partner countries must also improve the effectiveness of their policies, good governance and the protection of human rights.      Increased and more effective aid      The Commission and Member States should increase the quantity but also the quality of their aid. Together they supply more than half of global Official Development Assistance (ODA).     In order to increase the effectiveness of aid, the EU implements measures planned at the Accra summit in 2008:      division of labour and coordination of donors;       the use of national development systems;       quality of technical cooperation.      The EU must also work more closely with international organisations, local authorities and civil society. The next summit on the effectiveness of aid is to take place in Seoul in 2011.      Budget support for developing countries      The Commission promotes the deployment of aid through budget support strategies, i.e. the transfer of aid to the national treasury of its partners. Budget support guarantees that their national priorities are met. It also reduces the costs of financial transfers.     In 2009, EUR 2.4 billion were allocated to:      general budget support (GPS) – 35% of operations – for national development policies;       sector-specific budget support (SPS) – 65% of operations.      Public finance management (PFM) systems in developing countries should be efficient enough to receive this type of aid. However, the Commission proposes that certain fragile States might benefit from it under certain conditions.      Evaluation of results      The Commission has adopted stricter standards to control the quality of its actions and ensure that results are monitored. Assessments made in 2009 showed that the effectiveness and sustainability of cooperation actions are still to be improved. It is also essential to foster ownership of projects by partner countries.     Last updated: 27.08.2010  
summary of   Council Decision 94/800/EC on the conclusion on behalf of the EU of the agreements reached in the Uruguay Round of multilateral negotiations (1986-1994) — aspects related to trade in goods    Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations (1986-1994) — Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation    Notice on the entry into force of the protocol amending the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation   what is the aim of the decision and of the agreement  On behalf of the European Community (today the European Union), the decision approves the agreement that established the  World Trade Organization (WTO)  .   key points    Final act embodying the results of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations    Through this decision, the Council adopted, on behalf of the European Community and with regard to matters within its competence, the results of the Uruguay Round of negotiations embodied in the  Marrakesh Final Act  signed in 1994 in Morocco by the representatives of the Community and its member countries.   The Marrakesh Final Act includes a list of multilateral and plurilateral agreements and ministerial decisions and declarations that clarify rules of certain agreements. The multilateral trade agreements and the associated legal instruments are binding for all WTO members. As far as the plurilateral agreements are concerned, although they form part of WTO law they do not create obligations or rights for WTO members that have not accepted them.   The agreement establishing the WTO incorporates several annexes containing the specific agreements;  Annex 1A  encompasses the  multilateral agreements on trade in goods  . These are:   the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994)  , which included the GATT 1947;   the Agreement on  Agriculture  ;   the Agreement on the  Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures  ;   the Agreement on  Textiles and Clothing  ;   the Agreement on  Technical Barriers to Trade  ;   the Agreement on  Trade-Related Investment Measures  ;   the Agreement on  Anti-Dumping Measures  ;   the Agreement on  Customs Valuation  ;   the Agreement on  Preshipment Inspection  ;   the Agreement on  Rules of Origin  ;   the Agreement on  Import Licensing Procedures  ;   the Agreement on  Subsidies and Countervailing Measures  ;   the Agreement on  Safeguards  .      Annex 1B  of the WTO Agreement contains the General Agreement on  Trade in Services (GATS)     Annex 1C  consists of the Agreement on  Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)  , including trade in counterfeit goods.    Annex 2  incorporates the  Understanding on rules and procedures governing the settlement of disputes  .    Annex 3  relates to the  Trade Policy Review Mechanism (TPRM)  of WTO members.   Lastly,  Annex 4  deals with the  plurilateral trade agreements  . These are:   the Agreement on  Trade in Civil Aircraft  ;   the Agreement on  Government Procurement  (revised in 2012);   the  International Dairy Agreement  (terminated in 1997);   the  International Bovine Meat Agreement  (terminated in 1997).      Agreement establishing the WTO    This agreement creates a permanent institutional framework for the specific agreements listed above.   The WTO is a permanent organisation that benefits from a legal personality. All members of the GATT became funding members of the WTO on 1 January 1995. Since then, applicants wishing to join have had to follow the accession procedure set out in the agreement establishing the WTO.   The WTO members have set the following objectives for the organisation:   raising standards of living;   ensuring full employment and a growing volume of real income and effective demand;   expanding the production of and trade in goods and services;   sustainable development and protection of the environment;   taking account of the needs of developing countries.     The functions of the WTO are to:   facilitate the implementation, administration and operation of the various trade agreements;   provide a forum for multilateral trade negotiations;   resolve trade disputes through the  Dispute Settlement Body (DSB)  ;   review the national trade policies of its members;   cooperate with other international organisations in order to ensure greater coherence in global economic policymaking.      Structure    The  Ministerial Conference  , is the highest decision-making body of the WTO. It is composed of representatives of all the member countries and meets at least once every 2 years. Between these meetings, the  General Council  , made up of representatives of all the members, takes decisions related to the functioning of the WTO and supervises the agreements and ministerial decisions. The General Council also meets to discharge the responsibilities of the DSB and the  Trade Policy Review Body  (TPRB) provided for in the TPRM (see below).   The General Council has 3 subsidiary bodies: the  Council for Trade in Goods  , the  Council for Trade in Services  and the  Council for Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  . In addition, there are several committees directly attached to the General Council. These include the Committees on  Trade and Development  , on  Trade and Environment  and  Regional Trade Agreements  . Lastly, 2 committees are responsible for managing the 2 plurilateral agreements on trade in civil aircraft and on government procurement.   The General Council appoints a  director-general  who is responsible for heading the  Secretariat  of the WTO.   In principle, the WTO takes its decisions by consensus. When a decision cannot be reached, decisions are taken by a majority of votes, each WTO member having one vote. The EU, which is a full member of the WTO, has a number of votes equal to the number of EU countries that are members of the WTO.   Each member of the WTO may submit proposals to the Ministerial Conference to amend provisions of the WTO’s various multilateral trade agreements.    Understanding on rules and procedures governing the settlement of disputes    The WTO’s dispute settlement system is an important element of the multilateral trading order. It is based on Articles XXII and XXIII of the GATT 1994 and on the rules and procedures subsequently drawn up and set out in the understanding on rules and procedures governing the settlement of disputes incorporated into the agreement establishing the WTO.   The dispute settlement system covers all of the multilateral trade agreements. In fact, it applies to  trade in goods  ,  trade in services  and  intellectual property issues  covered by the TRIPS agreement. It also applies to disputes under the plurilateral Agreement on Government Procurement. Some of these agreements contain rules concerning the settlement of disputes that only apply to disputes under the agreement in question and that may supplement or modify the rules of the understanding.   The dispute settlement system is administered by the DSB, set up by the understanding. All WTO members may attend the DSB’s meetings. However, where the DSB regulates the rules that relate to the settlement of disputes concerning a plurilateral trade agreement, only the members that are party to the agreement will be able to participate in decisions or actions taken by the DSB with respect to disputes under that agreement.   The dispute settlement process is launched when one member submits to another a request for consultations on a specific issue. These consultations must begin within 30 days of the request. If the consultations fail to settle a dispute, a member may call on the DSB to set up a panel, usually consisting of three independent experts, in order to deal with the issue. In addition, the parties may voluntarily agree to make use of other dispute settlement methods, including good offices, conciliation and mediation.   After listening to the parties, the panel submits a report to the DSB. The panel must complete its work within 6 months or, in cases of urgency, within 3 months. The report is considered for adoption by the DSB 20 days after it has been circulated to members. It is adopted within 60 days of the date of circulation unless the DSB decides by consensus not to adopt the report (opposite or negative consensus) or if one of the parties notifies its decision to appeal.   Indeed, the WTO’s dispute settlement procedure enables all parties to a panel case to appeal. The appeal is, however, limited to issues of law covered in the panel report and legal interpretations developed by the panel. The appeal is examined by a standing  Appellate Body  composed of 7 members appointed by the DSB for a 4-year term. Three of the members serve on any one case. The Appellate Body’s report must be accepted unconditionally by the parties of the dispute and adopted by the DSB unless there is a negative consensus. In other words, a decision by consensus not to adopt the report.   The DSB keeps the implementation of adopted recommendations or decisions under surveillance, and all pending matters remain on the agenda of its meetings until they are resolved. Deadlines are also set for the implementation of recommendations set out in panel reports. When a party is unable to implement these recommendations within a reasonable period of time, it must enter into negotiations with the complaining party with a view to developing mutually acceptable compensation. If these negotiations are unsuccessful, the DSB may authorise the complaining party to suspend the application of concessions or obligations to the member concerned. Compensation and the suspension of concessions are, however, only temporary measures that may be applied until the DSB’s recommendations are implemented by the member concerned.   In all cases, WTO members agree that they will not themselves determine whether there has been a violation of the obligations laid down within the framework of the WTO, nor suspend concessions. They must apply the rules and procedures for the settlement of disputes set out in the understanding.   Furthermore, the understanding on rules and procedures governing the settlement of disputes recognises the special situation of the WTO’s  developing country members  and  least-developed country members  . Developing countries may opt for an accelerated procedure, request extended deadlines or request additional legal aid. WTO members are encouraged to give particular consideration to the situation of developing country members.    Trade Policy Review Mechanism    The  TPRM  was set up as a temporary measure under the GATT in 1989 following the mid-term review of the Uruguay Round. This mechanism is now an integral part of the WTO system and encompasses all the fields covered by the WTO agreements (goods, services and intellectual property questions).   The TPRM in particular aims to achieve greater transparency in, and an understanding of, the trade policies and practices of WTO members, to encourage members to adhere to the rules in force in the multilateral trading system and, thus, to promote the smooth functioning of the system.   Within the framework of the TPRM, all WTO members are subject to review. This review is held every 2 years for the members with the greatest share of world trade (currently China, the EU, Japan and the United States), every 4 years for the next 16 members and every 6 years for the other members. A longer period may be set for least developed countries. In practice, a certain degree of flexibility has been introduced to the rate of reviews (up to a 6-month interval). In 1996, it was agreed that every other review of each of the first four trading powers would be an interim review.   The review is carried out by the TPRB on the basis of a general policy declaration submitted by the member concerned and on a report drawn up by the WTO Secretariat. In drawing up its report, the Secretariat seeks the support of the member concerned but retains full responsibility for the facts presented and views expressed. The Secretariat’s report and the member’s declaration are published following the review meeting, together with the minutes of the meeting and the text of the final comments made by the chairman of the TPRB at the end of the meeting.   from when do the decision and the agreement apply   The decision has applied since 22 December 1994.   The agreement has applied since 1 January 1995.   background   For more information, see the other summaries on the same decision and agreement on EUR-Lex:    Aspects relating to trade in services     Aspects relating to trade in goods     Aspects of intellectual property rights     Agreement on intellectual property rights relating to trade and pharmaceutical patents  and    ‘EU and WTO’  (European Commission).
act   Directive  2001/83/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use   summary    what does the code do  It brings together all the existing provisions in force on the sale, production, labelling, classification, distribution and advertising of medicinal products for human use in the EU.   key points    All medicines offered for sale in the EU must have prior authorisation from either a national authority or the  European Medicines Agency  .   To receive the authorisation, manufacturers must provide a range of detailed therapeutic information about the product, including any possible side-effects.   Authorisation may be refused if a medicine’s risk-benefit ratio is not considered favourable or its therapeutic effect is insufficiently substantiated.   National authorities should make every effort to complete the authorisation procedure within 210 days from the submission of a valid application. Authorisation is valid for 5 years and is renewable.   A mutual recognition procedure exists to enable medicines already authorised in 1 EU country to be sold in another.   The legislation sets out in detail the information, such as storage precautions, expiry date and batch number, which must be given on the outer packaging.   Medicines are classified according to whether they require a medical prescription or not.   Strict controls are laid down for advertising medical products to the general public. The information must be presented objectively, not exaggerate an item’s properties and not be misleading.   National pharmacovigilance systems* are in place to collect information, particularly on adverse reactions in human beings, potentially useful for monitoring medicinal products.   Specific provisions apply to homeopathic products*. These may be subject to a simplified registration procedure if they are taken orally or applied externally.   The legislation does not apply to whole blood, plasma or certain medicinal products, such as those prepared in a pharmacy or used for research and development.   The European Commission has also issued guidelines for good practices in the  manufacture  and  distribution  of medicinal products.   when does the directive apply  From 18 December 2001.  For more information, see the  medicinal products for human use page of the European Commission’s website  .   key terms    * Pharmacovigilance systems:  systems set in place to monitor the effects of medicines and, in particular, to identify and assess adverse reactions.   * Homeopathic products:  remedies based on the idea that the body has the ability to heal itself, i.e. a substance that causes the symptoms of a disease in healthy people can cure similar symptoms in sick people.

   Traffic management: the creation of the single European sky     Traffic management: the creation of the single European sky     This Communication aims to optimise air traffic management and satisfy all airspace users, whether civil or military, airspace being a common asset which should be managed collectively regardless of national borders.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 1 December 1999 to the Council and the European Parliament - The creation of the single European sky [       COM(1999) 614      final - Not published in the Official Journal]     SUMMARY     The Commission considers that urgent measures are still required to bring air traffic management into line with the Community principle of the smooth operation of the internal market, and ensure the creation of a single European sky.     Airspace congestion is one of the most obvious signs that such action is needed. The delays on many European flights are frequently due to saturated airspace and infrastructure. Measures must be taken to deal with congestion and prevent crisis situations for all users.     In this context, the Commission considers that the creation of a single European sky requires not only joint technical and operational measures, but the collective management of airspace, which should permit a substantial reorganisation of its structures and organisation.     The reorganisation will be based on specific measures:      sectors being subdivided and routes established regardless of national borders. This will permit the airspace to be used more efficiently.       the division of airspace between civil and military users taking account of the new geopolitical realities and forming part of a consistent and efficient framework.      In making its proposals, the Commission is aware that each action and change depends on the collaboration of all the actors concerned. In particular, Eurocontrol (which currently has 28 members, including all the Community Member States except Finland, which is negotiating accession) should continue to play a vital role in realising the measures, in view of the experience it has acquired. It cannot be excluded, however, that countries which are members of Eurocontrol but non-Member States of the European Union may not wish to be party to the reorganisation.     In this case, the Commission must make suitable proposals for meeting the objectives of the Treaty by other means.     In order to avoid any obstacles which may present themselves in the course of implementing its proposals, the Commission has set up two specific working frameworks:      dialogue will be opened with the two sides of industry, as they will be using and operating the single sky,       a high-level group will be set up under the chairmanship of the Member of the Commission responsible for transport. The group will bring together those responsible for air traffic management in the Member States and will take account of the proposals for action contained in the Annexes to the Communication.The actions include:- evaluating the performance of the European air traffic management system,- developing the capacity of aeronautical infrastructure,- planning capacity,- developing incentives,- carrying out research and technological development,- standardising systems.      The Commission will present a report in the next 6 months to follow up the implementation of the measures proposed in the Communication.     Last updated: 24.01.2007  
   European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion (2010)     European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion (2010)     The fight against poverty and social exclusion is a primary objective of the European Union (EU) and its Member States. A significant part of the European population is in a situation of poverty and lacks access to basic services. The launch of a European Year dedicated to this objective is intended to give a new impetus to the process of social inclusion.     ACT     Decision No       1098/2008/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2008 on the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion (2010) (Text with EEA relevance).     SUMMARY     On the occasion of the European Year 2010, the European Union (EU) reaffirms its commitment to the fight against poverty and social exclusion. It promotes a social model contributing to the welfare of individuals, their participation in society and the economic development of Europe.     The fight against poverty and social exclusion is linked to a series of socioeconomic and cultural factors which call for multidimensional strategies of national, regional and local dimension. It requires the participation of public authorities and individuals alike.      Objectives and beneficiaries      This initiative aims at informing European citizens but also to give a voice to people in a situation of poverty and social exclusion.     In accordance with the European principles of solidarity and social justice, the Year will have four guiding principles.      Recognition of the fundamental right      of people in a situation of poverty to live in dignity and to play a full part in society. In particular, the aim is to guarantee access to resources, social services, culture and leisure.      Promotion of social cohesion      , in the form of actions to enhance quality of life, social welfare, equal opportunities and sustainable development, by promoting an employment market that is open to all and the principle of equality in education and training. In particular, these actions will target victims of discrimination, people with disabilities, children and situations of family poverty, vulnerable groups or groups in a situation of extreme poverty.      Shared responsibility and      collective and individual       participation      , to expand the role of all public or private actors in the fight against poverty and social exclusion.      Commitment and political action      by the Member States and the EU, and the intensification of actions taken at all levels of authority. In this respect, the potential of the open method of coordination (OMC       [m1]      ) introduced by the EU in 2000 in the fields of social protection and inclusion must be better exploited.      Actions and procedure      This initiative will give rise to actions launched at Community and national level. They will take the form of public awareness campaigns, innovative and creative initiatives, or meetings, discussions and studies. A committee of representatives of the Member States will support the Commission in the implementation of the European Year.     The Member States shall carry out these actions through national programmes adapting the Community guidelines to the challenges and priorities of each country. Each Member State shall appoint a body to prepare and implement these programmes. Those bodies will cooperate with civil society, the social partners, and regional and local authorities.     These objectives should be pursued both within the EU and beyond its borders. The initiative is open to participation by European Free Trade Association (EFTA) States, candidate countries for EU accession and third countries covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy (       ENP      ).      Context      The building of a society which is founded on social inclusion and on reducing poverty is one of the essential priorities of the EU. At the Lisbon summit in 2000 the Member States committed themselves to making progress towards the elimination of poverty in Europe by 2010.     Carried out in the context of the process of social inclusion, their actions require the wider participation of all the actors involved.

summary of   Directive 91/674/EEC on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of insurance undertakings   what is the aim of the directive  It aims to ensure that the balance sheets of all EU insurance companies have the same layout and the same item headings in order to ensure comparability.   key points   The directive applies to all insurance companies or firms except small mutual associations not carrying out insurance business.  It complemented the Fourth Council Directive (  Directive 78/660/EEC  ) on annual accounts of companies with limited liability which has since been repealed and replaced by Directive 2013/34/EU (  annual and consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings  ).  Even if national accounting standards may differ across EU countries, the directive prescribes certain basic information in the interests of greater comparability of consolidated accounts. To this end, the content of the various balance sheet items is determined precisely.  To provide a proper understanding of the financial situation of an insurance companies, the current value of investments, as well as their value based upon the principle of the purchase price or production cost, must be disclosed; disclosure of the current value of investments is also required.  For life assurance provisions use may be made of actuarial methods which may be laid down in national law and with due regard for the actuarial principles recognised.  Lastly, for the calculation of the provision for claims outstanding, any implicit discounting or deduction is prohibited. On the other hand, in the interests of prudence and transparency, precise conditions for recourse to explicit discounting or deduction are defined.  To adapt accounting disclosures to insurance business models, certain requirements are set out relating to the content of the notes on the accounts, e.g. gross premiums broken down by category of activity (accident and health, motor, fire, etc.) and by geographical market.  It must be possible to obtain a copy of accounts and annual reports upon request at a price not exceeding their administrative cost.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 23 December 1991 and had to become law in the EU countries by 1 January 1994.
   Strengthening passenger rights within the European Union     Strengthening passenger rights within the European Union     Over the last 30 years there has been a mobility boom in Europe. Passenger travel has more than doubled since 1970 (from 2 118 billion passenger kilometres in 1970 to 4 993 billion in 2002). At the same time, the air transport sector has seen a number of changes: the emergence of low cost airlines, the restructuring of other airlines, the opening up of new routes, and the availability of information or tickets on the internet with a general reduction in fares. However, the quality of the services on offer and the protection of passengers' rights remain inadequate, particularly on international routes. In the light of this, the Commission published a White Paper on European transport policy in which it committed itself to placing users at the heart of transport policy.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council "Strengthening passenger rights within the European Union" [       COM(2005) 46      final - not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The single market has generated a sizeable growth in demand for both passenger and goods transport. However, passengers have been faced with difficult situations which, rather than being the exception, have unfortunately become the norm, such as cancellations, overbooking, loss of luggage, delays, etc.     Passenger rights should be protected in the following ways:      specific measures in favour of persons with reduced mobility;       compensation and assistance in the event of a delay, cancellation or denied boarding;       liability in the event of death or injury;       treatment of complaints and means of redress;       passenger information.       Specific measures in favour of persons with reduced mobility      A passenger protection policy must include specific measures to protect persons with reduced mobility. There are some 45 million citizens with reduced mobility, or around 10 % of the European population. This figure includes not only disabled persons but also those who would be incapable of travelling without assistance because of their age, reduced mental capacity or illness.     These people should be guaranteed appropriate assistance, wherever they go and whatever the form of transport used, so that they can travel with confidence throughout the EU. They should never be refused travel or a reservation because of their reduced mobility. Moreover, they should receive the assistance that they need free of charge, both in airports, stations and ports and on board the means of transport itself.      Automatic and immediate solutions where travel is interrupted      Where a service is interrupted because of delay, cancellation or denied boarding, the passengers should be entitled to automatic solutions to overcome the difficulties they encounter whatever the method of transport. They can always bring judicial proceedings against carriers.      Liability in the event of death or injury of passengers      As a general rule, carriers are insured against the risk of physical damage to passengers; however, the requirements vary considerably at national level.     With the exception of the aviation sector, there is no guarantee of a sufficient and uniform level of insurance in all circumstances. As regards maritime transport, the Commission has already proposed that the Community and the Member States become contracting parties to the Athens Protocol relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea.     In the same way, coach travellers are faced with different national rules and do not know before which court they should bring their action. In view of this, the Commission will examine how to guarantee an adequate level of cover and a uniform approach to liability in international coach transport.      Treatment of complaints and means of redress      Once passengers have been made aware of their rights, the exercise of such rights should be made as simple as possible. Most of the time the judicial proceedings are complex or very lengthy. Hence the usefulness of extra-judicial mechanisms for solving disputes which offer significant advantages: speed, transparency, reasonable cost and flexibility. In the light of this, the Commission has established a European network of national bodies aimed at facilitating access to non-judicial procedures for the resolution of cross-border disputes.      Passenger information      Passengers should not only know the identity of the carrier who will operate the flight but also be certain that information which could affect the safety of the carrier and which could therefore concern them is indeed communicated rapidly and effectively between States.     The Commission has initiated a number of measures concerning passenger information, namely:      developing a system of indicators which will give air passengers access to key information on the quality of service so that they can easily and immediately compare the performance of carriers. The proposed indicators cover delays, denied boarding, cancellations and poor baggage handling;       pursuing its information campaign to publicise the rights created by Community legislation. The Commission will update the charter of air passengers' rights to include the new Community legislation on denied boarding, cancellation and long delays of flights and on the liability of air carriers;       obtaining a voluntary undertaking from air carriers and railway companies to set up an integrated ticketing system to enable passengers to combine several modes of transport in one journey through integrated ticketing;       studying, with the industry, the options for strengthening passengers' rights in the event of airlines going bankrupt.

   Strategy for sustainable development     Strategy for sustainable development     The European Union has formulated a long-term strategy to dovetail the policies for economically, socially and environmentally sustainable development, its goal being sustainable improvement of the well-being and standard of living of current and future generations.     ACT     Commission Communication of 15 May 2001 ‘A Sustainable Europe for a Better World: A European Union Strategy for Sustainable Development’ (Commission proposal to the Gothenburg European Council) [       COM(2001) 264      final – not published in the Official Journal].     Commission Communication of 13 December 2005 on the review of the Sustainable Development Strategy – A platform for action [       COM(2005) 658      final – not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This strategy provides an EU-wide policy framework to deliver sustainable development, i.e. to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.     It rests on four separate pillars – economic, social, environmental and global governance – which need to reinforce one another. The economic, social and environmental consequences of all policies thus need to be examined in a coordinated manner and taken into account when those policies are being drawn up and adopted. The EU also needs to assume its international responsibilities with regard to sustainable development, whose various aspects – including democracy, peace, security and liberty – need to be promoted beyond EU borders.     This strategy, which complements the Lisbon Strategy, shall be a catalyst for policy makers and public opinion, to change society’s behaviour. It is built around measures covering the main challenges identified, as well as cross-cutting measures, adequate funding, the involvement of all stakeholders and effective policy implementation and follow-up.     The strategy is based on the following guiding principles: promotion and protection of fundamental rights, solidarity within and between generations, the guarantee of an open and democratic society, involvement of citizens, involvement of businesses and social partners, policy coherence and governance, policy integration, use of best available knowledge, the precautionary principle and the polluter-pays principle.      Measures for responding to the key challenges      The strategy identifies seven unsustainable trends on which action needs to be taken. This strategy lists a whole range of operational and numerical targets and specific measures at EU level to attain these objectives. These measures were updated and developed in the 2005 strategy review.     The first long-term specific objective of the strategy is to limit       climate change      and its effects by meeting commitments under the       Kyoto Protocol      and under the framework of the       European Strategy on Climate Change      . Energy efficiency, renewable energy and transport will be the subject of particular efforts.     Limiting the adverse effects of       transport      and reducing regional disparities is another long-term objective, for which there is a need to break the link between economic growth and transport growth and do more to develop transport that is environmentally friendly and conducive to health. The strategy envisages, among other measures, infrastructure charging, promotion of alternatives to road transport and vehicles which produce less pollution and use less energy.     To promote more sustainable       modes of production and consumption      the link between economic growth and environmental degradation needs to be broken and attention paid to how much ecosystems can tolerate. With this aim in view, the EU must among other things promote green public procurement, define environmental and social performance targets for products in cooperation with stakeholders, expand the distribution of environmental innovations and environmental technologies and produce information about and appropriate labelling of products and services.      Sustainable management of natural resources      is also an objective. From now until 2010 overexploitation needs to be avoided, efficiency of natural resource use improved, the value of ecosystem services recognised and loss of biodiversity halted. In particular the EU must make efforts in agriculture, fisheries and forest management; see to it that the Natura 2000 network is completed; define and implement priority actions to protect biodiversity, and make sure that aspects associated with the seas and oceans are duly taken into account. Recycling and re-use must also be supported.     Limiting major threats to       public health      is another of the strategy’s objectives. Food safety and quality must be ensured throughout the food chain. Threats to health and the environment posed by chemicals must be removed by 2020 and research into the links between health and pollutants must be developed. Issues relating to epidemics, resistance to antibiotics and lifestyle must be tackled, in particular to prepare for a possible pandemic and combat HIV/AIDS.     In order to combat       social exclusion and poverty      and mitigate the effects of an ageing society, the EU must promote active ageing and make efforts to ensure the viability of pension and social protection systems, integrate legal migrants and develop a Community immigration policy, improve the situation of families – especially of children – and promote equality between men and women.     The revised strategy also provides for strengthening       the fight against global poverty      , monitoring global sustainable development and compliance with international commitments. To achieve this, the EU must in particular increase the amount of aid provided to less favoured countries, improve the coherence and quality of development aid policies and promote better international governance.      Intersectoral measures      The       Knowledge Society      must be the driving force behind sustainable development. Special efforts need to be made in education and training for the greatest number of participants, so as to bring about a change in behaviour and give the public the necessary skills to meet the objectives laid down in the strategy. Scientific and technical innovation also needs to be stimulated, especially through framework programmes of research and development and in association with universities, research institutes, businesses and government officials.      Financial and economic instruments      are another way to engender a market that offers less polluting products and services and to change consumer behaviour. Prices therefore need to reflect actual environmental and social costs, whereas fiscal measures should be applied to energy and resource consumption and/or pollution. In addition, financial support from European funds must be coordinated between the Commission and Member States to optimise efficiency.     Better       communication      will help involve businesses and the public. Stress is laid on the importance of systematic dialogue with consumers and of consulting other countries in order to mobilise the efforts of all parties. The different parties, including public administrations (European and national), businesses and the public (including non-governmental organisations) must establish partnerships among themselves.      Formulation of policies and review of progress      Member States must draw up national strategies and regularly review progress accomplished. They must carry out impact assessments before adopting their policies or committing public funds.     All the instruments available to the public authorities must be used to contribute to sustainable development. This includes regulations, but also incentives or market based instruments.     The Commission evaluates the implementation of the strategy once every two years on the basis of       sustainable development indicators      that it has adopted and, where necessary, updated. This evaluation forms the basis of another, carried out once every two years by the December European Council. Other bodies and institutions also examine what has been achieved and establish links with Member States and the public if required. The strategy provides for a review of its objectives by Council decision no later than 2011.      Background      The main lines of the strategy that the Commission proposed in 2001 were set out in the conclusions of the       Gothenburg European Council      of June 2001. It also formed part of the European Union’s preparatory work for the 2002 world summit on sustainable development (Rio + 10) held in Johannesburg. Before that summit the Commission presented another communication on how the Union should contribute towards sustainable development in the world; elements of that communication were incorporated into the strategy when it was reviewed.     A public consultation on the sustainable development strategy was organised following the appointment of the new Commission in 2004. The Commission also drew up a communication taking an overall look at the progress made thanks to the sustainable development strategy, referring to the main findings of the consultation and setting out broad orientations for review of the strategy.     For its part, the Brussels European Council of June 2005 reaffirmed both the key objectives of sustainable development and the guiding principles which need to underpin the renewed strategy.     In December 2005, the Commission adopted a communication in which it:      determines the main areas which require a fresh impetus in the years to come. It points out that these areas are interdependent and require responses based on cooperation and solidarity, on research and innovation and on the education of the population;       proposes to take more account of the impact of European policies on sustainable development at world level;       proposes methods to measure the progress achieved and regularly review priorities at national and Community levels;       recommends a permanent dialogue with the individuals and organisations – company heads, regional and local authorities, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), etc. – involved in sustainable development.      This communication underpinned the adoption of a new EU Sustainable Development Strategy at the       Brussels European Council      of June 2006.     RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 24 July 2009 - Mainstreaming sustainable development into EU policies : 2009 Review of the European Union Strategy for Sustainable Development [         COM(2009) 400        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      This Review reports on the policy developments carried out at European level following the adoption of the European Union Strategy for Sustainable Development. In this regard, the European Union plays an important role in the fight against climate change and in promoting a low-carbon economy.     However, progress in sustainable development still needs to be made and the Review opens a discussion on how the strategy can be improved. It should be better coordinated with other European policy strategies, particularly with the Lisbon Strategy on Growth and Jobs. The implementation of the strategy should be streamlined in order to improve its management and its actual results.      Commission Communication of 22 October 2007 ‘Progress Report on the Sustainable Development Strategy 2007’ [         COM(2007) 642        final – not published in the Official Journal].      In this report the Commission considers that progress achieved on the ground has been modest, but great advances in EU and Member State policy development have occurred in many areas, in particular climate change, clean energy and health.      Commission Communication of 9 February 2005 ‘The 2005 Review of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy: Initial Stocktaking and Future Orientations’ [         COM(2005) 37        final – not published in the Official Journal].      The Commission takes stock of progress since 2001, even though immediate results cannot be expected. The Commission also sets out the future orientations which should guide the review of the strategy, specifically:      reaffirming the new approach to policy making and policy coherence (impact assessment, stakeholder consultation, regulatory simplification, market-based instruments);       pursuing action on key unsustainable trends (assessment of these trends and the linkages between them);       setting new priority objectives and targets, together with intermediate milestones to measure progress;       reinforcing the monitoring of the strategy;       strengthening ownership of the strategy (awareness-raising and mobilisation) and improving cooperation with public and private actors.       Sustainable development indicators to monitor the implementation of the EU sustainable development strategy [SEC(2005) 161 - not published in the Official Journal].      The Commission presents a list of indicators for monitoring the implementation of the political priorities which were agreed at the Gothenburg and Barcelona European Councils or which relate to the commitments entered into by the European Union at the Johannesburg world summit on sustainable development. The list takes the form of a hierarchical framework of 12 headline indicators (corresponding to the main sustainable development themes identified at European and international level), 45 core policy indicators (corresponding to the key objectives of each theme) and 98 analytical indicators (corresponding to measures implementing the key objectives).

summary of   Directive 83/182/EEC on tax exemptions within the EU for certain means of transport temporarily imported into one EU country from another   what is the aim of the directive  It aims to eliminate tax obstacles to the temporary importation of certain means of transport within the  EU  by harmonising national tax arrangements.   key points   The directive exempts from turnover tax, excise duties, any other consumption tax and the taxes listed in the directive’s annex when the following are  temporarily imported  from another EU country:   various means of transport acquired or imported in accordance with the general conditions of  taxation  in force on the domestic market of an EU country:   motor-driven road vehicles (including their trailers)   caravans   pleasure boats   private aircraft   bicycles   tricycles   saddle-horses on horse-riding excursions     normal spare parts, accessories and equipment imported with those means of transport.   As a general rule, the temporary importation of these means of transport for  private use  is exempt from taxes — provided that the individual importing it is  normally resident  in a country other than the country of import — for at least 6 in any 12 months.   Commercial vehicles  (goods vehicles, vehicles intended to transport more than 9 passengers) are  excluded   from the exemption  .  The means of transport may not be  disposed of  ,  hired out  or  lent  in the EU country of temporary importation.  In exceptional cases, the temporary importation of a private vehicle  for business use  may be made conditional upon  payment of a security  .  There are specific rules relating to certain cases of temporary importation of private vehicles: these concern individuals  working or studying  in an EU country other than that of their normal residence.  EU countries are permitted to maintain or introduce more liberal exemption arrangements than those provided for in the directive.  The directive has been updated on several occasions to take account of the EU’s  enlargement  to include more countries.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 31 March 1983 and had to become law in the EU countries by 1 January 1984.
summary of   Directive 2008/90/EC — marketing of fruit plant propagating material and fruit plants intended for fruit production   what is the aim of the directive   It updates and improves EU rules to ensure that purchasers receive propagating material  *  and fruit plants which are healthy and of good quality.   It improves and streamlines the system of rules in which businesses operate, reflecting scientific and technical progress and setting out clear conditions that have to be met to satisfy new consumer and industry needs.   The directive is a  recast  and replaces Council Directive  92/34/EEC  .   key points    Scope    It applies to the marketing of fruit plant propagating material and fruit plants intended for  fruit production within the EU  .   Annex 1 provides a list of the genera and species (as well as their hybrids  *  ) which are included.   The directive also applies to rootstocks  *  and other parts of plants of other genera or species (and hybrids) not listed in Annex 1, if material of genera or species listed in Annex I or their hybrids is  grafted   *  or is to be grafted onto them.   It does not apply to propagating material or fruit plants  intended for export to non-EU countries  , provided they are identified as such and kept sufficiently isolated.   The directive covers:    requirements for propagating material and fruit plants  — includes general requirements for being placed on the market and specific requirements for each genus and species mentioned in Annex 1;    requirements to be met by suppliers  — including the rules for registration of suppliers and specific requirements related to the responsibility of suppliers in the production and reproduction process of all propagating material and fruit plants;    variety identification and labelling  — propagating material and fruit plants must be marketed with a reference to the variety to which they belong. If the material does not belong to a variety, as may be the case for rootstocks, the species or interspecific hybrid must be mentioned;    exemptions  — small producers whose production and sales of propagating material and fruit plants is intended for  final use  by persons on the local market who are  not professionally involved  in plant production may be exempted from the labelling rules and checks and official inspections;    propagating material and fruit plants produced in non-EU countries  — until 31 December 2022 EU countries may assess if propagating material and fruit plants produced in a non-EU country is equivalent in all aspects to material produced in the EU;      control measures  — covering:    official inspections by EU countries  — by a body officially appointed by the EU country and notified to the  European Commission  ;    EU monitoring  — the Commission may inspect trials carried out by EU countries to check that material conforms with the directive’s requirements and conditions;    checks  — the Commission may organise on-the-spot checks;    follow-up action  — if a material is found not to meet the requirements, appropriate measures must be taken by the EU country including a ban on marketing of the materials.     from when does the directive apply  Directive 2008/90/EC  revised  and replaced Directive  92/34/EEC  (and its subsequent amendments) and EU countries had to apply the new rules of Directive 2008/90/EC by 30 September 2012.   background    The directive is the final step in establishing common EU rules for the marketing of propagating material.   The directive has been amended on 3 occasions including by Regulation (EU) No 652/2014 on  EU spending on information about food and animal feed  .   For more information, see:    EU marketing requirements  (  European Commission  ).     key terms    Propagating material:  seeds, parts of plants and all plant material, including rootstocks, intended for the propagation and production of fruit plants.   Hybrid:  plant obtained by grafting the upper part of one plant onto a rootstock of another plant to combine the best characteristics of the two plants.   Rootstock:  a healthy root system and some portion of the stem which is used as the lower plant portion in grafting.   Grafting:  the process whereby the upper part of one plant is attached to the root system (rootstock) of another plant so that they appear to be a single plant.
   State aid in short-term export-credit insurance     State aid in short-term export-credit insurance     The Commission aims to remove distortions of competition due to state aid in the short-term export-credit insurance sector where there is competition between public or publicly supported export-credit insurers and private export-credit insurers. This communication states that, as a general rule, marketable risks cannot be covered by export-credit insurance with the support of European Union (EU) countries.     ACT     Commission communication to the Member States pursuant to Article 88(1) of the Treaty applying Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty to short-term export-credit insurance (Text with EEA relevance) [       Official Journal C 281 of 17.09.1997      ].     Amended by:     Communication of the Commission to Member States amending the communication pursuant to Article 93(1) of the EC Treaty applying Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty to short-term export-credit insurance [       Official Journal C 325 of 22.12.2005      ].     Communication of the Commission amending the period of application of Communication of the Commission to the Member States pursuant to Article 93(1) of the EC Treaty applying Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty to short-term export-credit insurance [       Official Journal C 329 of 7.12.2010      ].     SUMMARY     In some European Union (EU) countries public or publicly supported export-credit agencies insure short-term export risks for the account or with the guarantee of the state by financing transactions in the EU and with a large number of non-EU countries.     From a competition viewpoint, the fact that these credit-insurance agencies enjoy certain financial advantages granted by the state enables them to offer better credit-insurance terms, and this may distort competition in relation to private insurers. This communication aims to remove distortions of competition due to state aid in the export-credit insurance sector.     This communication applies to state aid in the short-term export-credit insurance sector. It does not, however, deal with the insurance of medium and long-term export-credit risks, which are largely non-marketable at the present time.      Definition of "marketable" risks      Marketable risks are risks for which in principle a market exists, i.e. there is a private insurance capacity available to cover these risks. The definition of which risks are marketable may evolve over time.     At present, marketable risks are defined as commercial and political risks on public and non-public debtors established within the European Union and in certain of the       Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development      (OECD) member countries. They are linked to short-term export credits with a maximum risk period of less than two years. All other risks are excluded from the definition of marketable risks and from the scope of this communication. Despite this definition of marketable risks, if and to the extent that no private insurance market exists in the EU country, commercial and political risks incurred on public and non-public debtors established in the countries listed in the annex to this communication are considered to be temporarily non-marketable if incurred by small and medium-sized enterprises with a total annual export turnover not exceeding EUR 2 million.      Factors distorting competition and measures to be taken to restore the free interplay of competition on the market      The communication identifies the factors that may distort competition in favour of public export-credit insurers, including:      state guarantees enabling insurers to borrow at rates lower than the normal market rates or making it possible for them to borrow money at all;       any difference in the obligations on public insurers and private insurers as regards the maintenance of adequate provisions;       relief or exemption from taxes normally payable;       grants of aid or provisions of capital by the state.      In order to remove distortions of competition in this sector, EU countries are called on to eliminate the following types of state aid:      state guarantees for borrowing or losses;       exemption from the requirement to constitute adequate reserves;       relief or exemption from taxes or other charges normally payable;       the granting of aid, the provision of capital or the granting of other forms of finance in circumstances or on terms that a private investor acting under normal market conditions would not accept;       provision by the state of services in kind (such as access to and use of state infrastructure, facilities or privileged information) on terms not reflecting their cost;       reinsurance by the state on terms more favourable than those available from the market.      Exceptionally, where export-credit insurers are temporarily unable to cover marketable risks because of insufficient insurance or reinsurance capacity, those temporarily non-marketable risks may be covered by a public or publicly supported export credit insurer with the support of the state. In such cases, the insurer shall, as far as possible, align its premium rates for such risks with the rates charged elsewhere by private export-credit insurers for the type of risk in question. Any EU countries intending to use the escape clause must notify this to the Commission and wait for a Commission approval.     The agencies will, in addition, have to keep a separate administration and separate accounts for their insurance of marketable risks and non-marketable risks for the account and with the guarantee of the state.      Monitoring by the Commission      The Commission will monitor at all times national reinsurance schemes on the basis of six-monthly reports presented by EU countries. The communication will remain in force until 31 December 2012.      Background      In December 2008, as a consequence of the financial crisis, the Commission adopted the Temporary framework for State aid measures to support access to finance in the current financial and economic crisis ('       the Temporary Framework'      ), which introduced a temporary procedural simplification to point 4.4 of the 1997 communication, regarding the demonstration of the unavailability of cover for short-term export-credit. This procedural simplification will be valid till 31 December 2011.     Last updated: 14.06.2011  
summary of   Article 2 Treaty on European Union    EU guidelines on Human Rights Defenders   what is the aim of article 2 of the treaty on european union and the guidelines on human rights defenders   Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union states that the EU is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy,  equality  , the  rule of law  and respect for  human rights  .   The guidelines establish the EU’s approach to supporting and protecting human rights defenders  *  in non-EU countries, with a view to enabling them to operate freely.   In operational terms, these guidelines apply within the context of the  common foreign and security policy (CFSP)  .   key points   The following are the most important aspects of the guidelines:   Diplomats at  EU missions   *  will meet regularly with human rights defenders, visit detained activists, monitor their trials and advocate for their protection.   The  Council Working Party on Human Rights (COHOM)  is to identify the situations in which the EU is called upon to intervene on the basis of reports from EU heads of missions (HoMs), the  United Nations  , the  Council of Europe  and non-governmental organisations.   High-ranking EU officials (e.g. the  High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy  ) will include meetings with human rights defenders as part of their visits to non-EU countries.   Political dialogue with non-EU countries and regional organisations will include the situation of human rights defenders.   Heads of missions will remind the authorities of non-EU countries of their responsibility to protect human rights defenders in danger.   The EU will cooperate closely with non-EU countries that also have policies to protect human rights defenders, and will work with the human rights mechanisms of other regional organisations, such as the  African Union  , the  Organisation of American States  and the  Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe  .   The EU will promote the strengthening of existing, and creation of new, regional mechanisms for the protection of human rights defenders.   The EU’s commitment to supporting human rights defenders is complemented by the  European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR)  , which provides financial assistance to organisations supporting human rights activists.   background   Human rights defenders play a key role in:   documenting violence;   providing victims of human rights violations with legal, psychological, medical or other support;   combating the impunity of those responsible for human rights violations; and   raising awareness of human rights and their defenders at national, regional and international levels.   However, human rights defenders are often targets of attacks and threats, which is why it is important to ensure their safety and protection.  For more information, see:   ‘  Human Rights and Democracy  ’ (  European Union External Action Service  )   ‘  What does it take to be a Human Rights Defender?  ’ (  European Union External Action Service  )   key terms    Human rights defenders:  individuals, groups or organisations that promote and protect in a peaceful manner the universally recognised human rights, namely civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, including the rights of individuals belonging to indigenous peoples.   EU missions:  embassies and consulates of EU countries and EU delegations.   main documents   Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union — Title I — Common provisions —  Article 2  (OJ C 202, 7.6.2016, p. 17)   Ensuring protection – European Union Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders  , Council of the EU (Foreign Affairs), 2008
act   Joint communication to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace (  JOIN(2013) 1 final  of 7.2.2013)   summary   To further the European Union’s values of freedom and democracy and enable the digital economy to grow safely, the EU is committed to providing the world’s most secure online environment.   what does the joint communication do  It sets out the EU’s cyber security strategy, providing for:   partnerships with the private sector and non-governmental organisations or interest groups,   concrete action to protect and promote citizens’ rights.   It was published alongside a  proposal for a directive on network and information security  .   key points   Cybersecurity policy within the EU and internationally should be governed by  5 principles  :    1.    the EU’s  core principles  (which must apply equally in the digital and physical worlds);      2.    the protection of fundamental rights, freedom of expression, privacy and personal data;      3.    the right of the general public to safe internet access and an unrestricted flow of information;      4.    democratic and efficient governance, including all sectors of society;      5.    joint responsibility for ensuring security.     The strategy is based on  5 priorities  :   enable systems and domains to manage cyber-attacks or failures,   drastically reduce cybercrime,   develop cyberdefence policy and capabilities related to the  Common Security and Defence Policy  (CSDP),   develop industrial and technological resources for cybersecurity,   establish a coherent international cyberspace policy for the European Union and promote core EU values.   Taking into account the international nature of cyberspace, the strategy requires bodies at EU and national levels to take responsibility, work together and liaise with industry and academia. These bodies include the competent EU and national authorities for:   Network Information Security (  ENISA  /NIS),   Computer Emergency Response Teams (  CERT-EU  /CERT),   law enforcement (  Europol Cybercrime Centre - EC3  and  Eurojust  ),   defence (  European Defence Agency  ).   The strategy also includes engaging in dialogue with international bodies such as the  Council of Europe  ,  NATO  and the  United Nations  .

summary of   Communication (COM(2017) 713 final) — The Future of Food and Farming    Article 39 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)    Article 40 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)   what is the aim of the communication and of articles 39 and 40 tfeu  The  communication  :   aims to stimulate a wide-ranging debate on ways to  simplify and modernise  the  common agricultural policy (CAP)  after 2020.   emphasises the need for  simpler rules  ,  greater flexibility  and a stronger contribution, working alongside other EU policies, to tackling the socio-economic challenges resulting from  climate change  ,  environmental protection  and  sustainable farming  .    Article 39 TFEU  sets out the  CAP’s objectives  which aim to:   increase agricultural productivity by promoting technical progress and by ensuring the rational development of agricultural production and the optimum utilisation of the factors of production, in particular labour;   ensure a fair standard of living for farmers;   stabilise markets;   assure the availability of supplies;   ensure that supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices.    Article 40 TFEU  introduces the  common organisation of agricultural markets  in order to attain the CAP’s objectives. Depending on the product concerned, this common organisation can take several forms:   common rules on  competition  ;   compulsory coordination of the various national market organisations;   a  European market organisation  .   key points   The communication outlines ideas for the future of food and farming, such as:   The EU moves away from the current ‘  one-size-fits-all  ’ approach. Instead, it sets the general EU policy objectives, while individual EU countries decide what the specific targets should be and how to meet them.   Rather than on compliance, attention will be paid to ensuring that funding is focused on results.   Each country draws up a  CAP strategic plan  which the  European Commission  approves to ensure policy coherence across the EU.   Existing rules should be made simpler and bureaucracy reduced.   Support for farmers will continue through the system of direct payments which will be more fairly distributed and better targeted.   The future CAP should:   encourage  smart   *  and  resilient   *  farming, ensuring food security through greater use of modern technologies;   strengthen and contribute to the EU’s wider  environmental, resource efficiency  and  climate goals  ;   support the  social and economic life of rural areas  by providing jobs, attracting new farmers to the profession and encouraging local authorities and agencies to fully develop an area’s potential;   ensure the European public continues to have access to  safe, high quality, affordable and nutritious range of food  .   Other ideas include:   support for   Smart Villages   to develop broadband connections, and sustainable and good quality jobs;   EU-wide financial support to  help new farmers  with their initial capital costs and uncertain income;   improving advisory services and promoting knowledge and innovation in agriculture and rural areas;   commitments to ensure the modernised CAP will contribute to the  United Nations’ sustainable development goals  , further  trade liberalisation  and efforts to  tackle the root causes of migration  , particularly from Africa.   background   The CAP is the oldest EU common policy. Since 1962, it has been reformed several times to adapt to new challenges and the changing European and global environments.  The Commission launched a  public consultation  on the future of the CAP in February 2017. It received over 320,000 replies within the 3-month consultation period. These showed strong support for the policy, but also a wish for it to be simpler, more flexible and more focused on ensuring fair income for farmers and tackling environmental and climate challenges.  The Commission looked to introduce draft legislation to modernise the CAP in the first half of 2018 after it presented its  multiannual budget  proposals for EU spending from 2020 onwards.  For more information, see:    The Future of Food and Farming — for a flexible, fair and sustainable Common Agricultural Policy  — press release (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Smart farming:  ensuring that the EU’s agriculture sector is equipped to address the issues it faces by means of education, research and innovation.   Resilient farming:  ensuring the farming sector is able to adapt to changing circumstances and challenges while maintaining its core functions, including the delivery of their vital goods and services.
act   Council Regulation (EU)  2015/322  of 2 March 2015 on the implementation of the 11th European Development Fund.   summary   The European Development Fund (EDF) is the European Union’s (EU) main instrument for providing development aid to African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and to overseas countries and territories (OCTs) under the  Cotonou Agreement  .   what does this regulation do  It ensures that the EDF funds cooperation activities based on the terms of the Cotonou Agreement*. The primary objective of EU cooperation activities is the  reduction and eventual eradication of poverty  .  Cooperation must also contribute to the following:        —     fostering sustainable and inclusive economic, social and environmental development;            —     consolidating and supporting democracy, the rule of law, good governance, human rights and the relevant principles of international law;            —     implementing a rights-based approach encompassing all human rights.      key points   The EDF is financed by direct contributions from EU countries according to specific contribution shares (‘keys’) and is covered by its own financial rules. It is not part of the EU budget.  The total financial resources of the 11th EDF amount to €30.5 billion for the period 2014-2020.   The European Investment Bank  will make available an additional EUR 2.6 billion in the form of loans from its own resources.  Under the 11th EDF, EU countries' ‘contribution keys’ were aligned with the key used for the  EU budget  (based on gross national income per capita).  The European Commission decides the financial allocations for each ACP country and region on the basis of criteria laid down in the Cotonou Agreement. ACP countries are given specific, tailor-made cooperation based on:        —     their needs;            —     their capacities to generate and access financial resources and absorption capacities;            —     their commitments and performance; and            —     the potential impact of EU assistance.      The  countries most in need  , in particular the least developed countries, low-income countries and countries in crisis, post-crisis, fragile and vulnerable situations, are given priority in the resource allocation process.   when does this regulation apply  From 6 March 2015 until the final date of application of the 11th EDF Internal Agreement.   background   Created in 1957 by the Treaty of Rome and launched in 1959, the EDF is the EU’s main instrument for assistance to the ACP. Each EDF is concluded for a period of several years.  The 10th EDF ran for 6 years from 2008 to 2013 with a budget of €22.7 billion. This represented about 30 % of EU spending on development cooperation aid, with the remainder coming directly from the EU budget. The 9th EDF was initially allocated €13.8 billion for 2000-2007.  The first partnership convention between the EU and ACP was concluded in 1964 with the Yaoundé I Convention. The Cotonou Agreement was concluded for a 20-year period from March 2000 to February 2020. A first revised version entered into force on 1 July 2008. A second revision of the agreement took place on 11th March 2010 in order to adapt to new challenges such as climate change, food security, regional integration, state fragility and aid effectiveness.   key terms    * Cotonou Agreement:  the partnership agreement between the members of the ACP Group of States and the European Union, signed on 23 June 2000 in Cotonou, Bénin. It is the framework for EU’s relations with 79 countries from ACP. Partnership is based on 3 complementary pillars:        —     development cooperation;            —     economic and trade cooperation; and            —     the political dimension.

   ICT standardisation: modernisation and the way forward     ICT standardisation: modernisation and the way forward     Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is a key industrial sector subject to very rapid and complex change. In view of this situation, the European Commission deems it necessary to establish clearer standards for ICT and to adapt legislation to current circumstances.     ACT     Commission White Paper of 3 July 2009 - Modernising ICT Standardisation in the EU: the Way Forward [       COM(2009) 324      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This White Paper presents various proposals aimed at modernising European Information and Communication Technology (ICT) standardisation policy. This modernisation should allow the needs of industry and society to be met more appropriately.      Why modernise ICT standardisation policy?      In order to ensure that quality ICT standards are developed, it is important that these standards and standardisation procedures meet certain requirements. The European Commission proposes to use the criteria established by the World Trade Organization (WTO) in order to define a list of attributes that ICT standards should fulfil. In particular this list should include openness and transparency, as well as standards covering neutrality, maintenance and intellectual property rights.      The use of ICT standards in public procurement      Public procurement is regulated by       Directive 2004/18/EC      which allows technical standards to be used in public procurement.       Decision 87/95      , which lays down EU standardisation policy in the field of ICT, provides guidance for public procurement of ICT systems. This Decision is now considered to be outdated insofar as it only takes into consideration products and not the services and ICT applications that are used today.     The Commission therefore proposes to amend Decision 87/95 and adapt it, as regards public procurement in the field of ICT, to the current needs of the ICT sector.      Fostering synergy between research, innovation and standardisation      Establishing standards in the field of ICT should facilitate the translation of research results into practical applications. In order to do this, the issue of standardisation should be taken into account at an early stage in the research cycle.     The Commission would like to see closer collaboration between European Technology Platforms and standard setting organisations.      Intellectual property rights      ICT interoperability is one of the features of the current technological environment. In this context, taking into account the protection of       intellectual property rights      (IPR) when establishing ICT standards is essential. Establishing standards should not however hinder free competition.     The Commission proposes that standard setting organisations in the field of ICT should implement clear and non-discriminatory policies with respect to IPR which guarantee competition. The Commission also suggests that standard setting organisations consider a declaration of the most restrictive licensing terms, in particular stating maximum royalty rates prior to a standard being adopted.      Integration of fora and consortia      Current European standardisation policy only takes into account standards established by European Standardisation Organisations (ESOs). Increasingly however, ICT standards are established by fora and consortia (e.g. standards relating to Internet protocols established by IETF or web accessibility guidelines produced by W3C). The Commission now wishes to see better cooperation between these ICT fora and consortia and the ESOs.     The Commission also considers it necessary to authorise the use of standards established by fora and consortia in order to fill specific standardisation gaps.      Enhancing dialogue and partnership with stakeholders      Decision 87/95 establishes a Committee: the Senior Officials group on standardisation in the field of Information Technology (SOGITS). This group is responsible for assisting the Commission in implementing the Decision and may extend invitations to experts. However, until now its success has been relatively limited.     The Commission wishes to replace the SOGITS Group by a platform bringing together all stakeholders concerned by ICT standardisation policy. This organisation would be based on the model of the ICT Standard Board (ICTSB) whose function and current composition the Commission wishes to review.      Context      ICT represents a key industrial sector in the 21st century. In 2007, the European ICT industry had a turnover of EUR 670 billion and accounted for over 5 % of employment. European ICT nevertheless requires a clear standardisation framework which will foster competitiveness and innovation.

   Action Plan to Combat Drugs (2000-2004)     Action Plan to Combat Drugs (2000-2004)     To intensify cooperation and collaboration at national and European level, a European action plan to combat drug abuse and drug trafficking has been introduced. Through the plan, the Commission is establishing the general guidelines for Union action to combat drugs and drug abuse.     ACT     Communication of 26 May 1999 from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on a European Union Action Plan to Combat Drugs (2000-2004) [       COM(1999) 239      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Since the mid-1980s, the Member States have stepped up cooperation on combating drug addiction and drug trafficking. Since 1990, European Councils have adopted a variety of action plans and programmes to provide a comprehensive response to this phenomenon. The European Councils in Cardiff (June 1998) and Vienna (December 1998) called on the Council, the Commission and Parliament to draw up a new, comprehensive anti-drug strategy to replace the       1995-1999 Action Plan      . The Commission communication is a follow-up to this request and sets out recent trends in drug abuse and trafficking in the EU and the course the Union's anti-drugs measures should take over the next five years.     The setting up of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (       EMCDDA      ) and the       Europol Drugs Unit      (replaced since 1 July 1999 by the European Police Office (       Europol      )) has led to a better understanding of the drug phenomenon and simplified Member States' cooperation on the collection and exchange of information.     The information provided by these two bodies in 1998 has made it possible to identify a number of trends in consumption and trafficking. The use of cannabis, still the most widely used drug in the EU, has levelled out, while the use of amphetamines and misuse of medicines is on the increase. As regards trafficking, the routes used by the various drugs are well known, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the Balkans often serving as the hub for heroin, cocaine and cannabis. The EU is also a major producer of synthetic drugs.     The Action Plan proposed by the Commission requires a global, multidisciplinary and integrated strategy to fight drugs if it is to be effective. The social and health implications of the drugs problem need to be addressed, as do the links between drug-taking and crime and delinquency. A balanced approach to reducing demand and supply is therefore needed. Furthermore, if the production of drugs is to be reduced, there must be a partnership between producer and consumer countries to provide support for social and economic development in the producer countries.     The Commission would like to see a more systematic assessment, by independent experts, of the measures, policies and strategies adopted by the EU in the fight against drugs. It will carry out a mid-term evaluation of the forthcoming action plan. The data supplied by the EMCDDA and Europol on drug use and trafficking will also make it possible to monitor the situation and if necessary adjust Union policy.     The plan for 2000-2004 identifies a number of priorities:      measures to counter the use and production of cannabis, amphetamines and ecstasy;       the introduction of integrated projects to combat urban delinquency, especially among young people;       measures in the field of health (hepatitis), social exclusion and criminal justice;       preparations for enlargement with participation by applicant countries in EMCDDA and EU drug addiction projects and measures under the Phare Programme.      The Amsterdam Treaty provides a new legal framework for achieving these ambitious objectives. Under the new Article 152 of the EC Treaty, public health must be taken into account in all Community policies and actions. The drugs problem is also listed as a priority for Community action in the field of public health and cooperation in the fields of justice and home affairs (Title VI of the Treaty on European Union), which mentions three possible methods:      direct cooperation between police forces and customs authorities of the Member States or cooperation through Europol;       judicial cooperation;       approximation, where necessary, of rules on criminal matters in the Member States.      Although drugs continue to be an important theme in international cooperation, no new instruments are planned. Multilateral and bilateral activities already under way will continue.     The Action Plan has five general objectives:      to ensure that the fight against drugs continues to be a major priority for EU internal and external action;       to continue the integrated and balanced approach to reducing supply and demand;       to continue the processing of information with the support of the EMCDDA and Europol;       to promote international cooperation, particularly through the United Nations;       to mobilise the necessary resources.      Five specific objectives are also identified:       Information:        A comprehensive strategy has to be based on reliable information in order to assess the scale and nature of drug use on a regular basis (the EMCDDA's REITOX network, cooperation between the EMCDDA and Eurostat) as well as on knowledge obtained from research and assessments of earlier programmes.        Action on demand reduction:        The aim is to reduce drug use by the under-18s and the number of drug-related deaths over a period of five years. This will require measures in the field of public health and education (information campaigns in schools). Research is also needed under the Fifth framework programme to improve understanding of consumption factors and associated health and social consequences and to develop more effective treatment. A number of other areas should be studied as a matter of priority, including the effects of drug use on driving and doping in sport.        Action on reduction of illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances:        On the question of the diversion of precursors and psychotropic substances, monitoring must be carried out on targeted products if it is to be effective. Twenty-two such substances are listed in the 1988 United Nations Convention. Those which are not must be the subject of "special surveillance" in cooperation with industry.On money laundering, the Commission wishes to extend the scope of the         1991 Directive        on this subject. A range of international measures are also being carried out as part of the PHARE and TACIS programmes.Use of the new technologies, and particularly the Internet, must be made safer (an         action plan        was adopted on this subject in January 1999). Although only the national authorities have the power to initiate legal proceedings or impose penalties, they may call on the assistance of Europol if necessary.Special attention will be given to synthetic drugs through legislation and practical cooperation both within Europe and at international level.Finally, a large number of medium and short-term measures are proposed in the         action plan        to establish an area of freedom, security and justice.        Action at international level        This will be based on national and/or regional plans and is guided by a number of principles, including shared responsibility, integrating drugs control into mainstream development and respect for human rights. The regions mainly concerned are the applicant countries, Latin America, the Caribbean and Central Asia (extending to Transcaucasia), the Mediterranean countries (especially Morocco), Africa and Asia (including China). Cooperation with the industrialised countries and in international bodies (such as the G8, for example) will be strengthened with a view to promoting dialogue and introducing integrated and/or regional policies and programmes. Cooperation with international organisations such as the United Nations Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) must be stepped up.        Coordination        The drugs phenomenon affects different areas and is covered by a variety of legal bases. The Commission considers that coordination is essential and must involve all the EU institutions and bodies, especially on the question of drug addiction.      The annex includes an assessment of the 1995-1999 action plan, a table of current trends in drug demand reduction, current development in legislation and practices and a list of budget headings on which actions in the field of drugs can be based.     RELATED ACTS      EVALUATION       Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 22 October 2004 on the results of the final evaluation of the EU Drugs Strategy and Action Plan on Drugs (2000-2004) - Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2000-2004 Action Plan provides for the Commission to undertake mid-term and final evaluations of its implementation. This communication presents the results of the final evaluation and lays the foundation for the future evolution of EU drugs policy on the basis of the lessons learnt from the implementation of current policy.     The communication gives details of the main achievements and identifies areas where further progress is needed.      CONCLUSIONS      The communication concludes       inter alia      that:      around 95% of the actions set out in the Plan have been implemented or are in the process of being implemented;       almost all the Member States have adopted a national drugs strategy or action plan;       taking the evaluation tools used, there is nothing to support the contention that the goal to significantly reduce drug abuse has been achieved or that fewer young people are using drugs; however, there is evidence of an overall levelling-off in the upward trend in drug addiction;       similarly, the available information does not suggest that the availability of drugs has been reduced substantially; none the less, a number of EU-level initiatives have strengthened law enforcement measures against drug trafficking and supply;       a number of important initiatives have also been taken to combat money laundering; in particular, Member States are participating in a number of initiatives to combat the diversion of precursors, such as the European Joint Unit on Precursors (EJUP).       PROPOSALS      The communication sets out the following proposals for the future EU drugs strategy:      it should contain clear and precise objectives and priorities that can be translated into operational indicators and measures in the future Action Plan, with responsibility and deadlines for their implementation being clearly defined;       continued progress should be made on the availability, quality and comparability of information on monitoring the drugs situation;       the objectives of the new strategy and action plans should be reflected in the multi-annual programme consolidating the area of freedom, security and justice;       the primary focus of the work of the Council's Horizontal Drugs Group should be on moving forward and monitoring the implementation of the measures set out in the future EU action plans on drugs; it should also have a leading role in coordinating the work of the other Council groups on drug issues;       the results of the many activities undertaken in the field of drugs should be more widely shared to promote similar activities elsewhere;       this final evaluation should be taken into account in the development of the new EU drugs strategy 2005-2012.      The Commission will present a proposal at the beginning of 2005 for an Action Plan on Drugs 2005-2008. In addition, it will draw up an annual progress review on the implementation of this Plan and will organise an impact assessment in 2008 with a view to proposing a second Action Plan for the period 2009-2012. In 2012 the Commission will organise an overall evaluation of the EU Drugs Strategy and Action Plans.      Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 4 November 2002 on the mid-term evaluation of the EU Action Plan on Drugs (2000-2004) [         COM(2002)599        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      The evaluation covers the five main areas of the Plan: coordination, information and evaluation, demand reduction, prevention of drug use and of drug-related crime, supply reduction and international cooperation. It is based on four main sources of information:      the replies of the Member States to a questionnaire on progress at national level;       the updated follow-up table of the achievements of the Commission, the EMCDDA and Europol;       the evaluation of law enforcement in the Member States and its role in the fight against drugs trafficking;       the initiatives taken at EU level, either by the Commission or by Member States, which have been adopted or which are under examination.       RESULTS OF THE MID-TERM EVALUATION      Following a detailed assessment of each of the five main areas of the plan, the Commission concluded that, despite considerable progress, much work remained to be done, particularly in the following areas:      the issue of synthetic drugs;       the further development of the evaluation of drug policies and drugs activities at national and EU levels on the basis of reliable data (importance of research);       close cooperation with the candidate countries;       more effective coordination of action in third countries (with a particular focus on the main producing and transit countries).      In order to take forward implementation of the EU Action Plan on Drugs, the Commission makes the following proposals:      priorities among the activities set out in the Action Plan should be identified in order to focus on these key activities (e.g. by setting deadlines for implementation);       a steering group, to include representatives from the Commission, the Council Presidency, Europol and the EMCDDA, should be established in 2003 by the Presidency and the Commission; Parliament should also appoint its representative; the group's aim would be to provide guidance and to monitor the preparation of the final assessment;       initiatives in the field of drugs should be primarily focused on achieving the objectives set out in the Action Plan;       the EMCDDA and Europol should compare 2003 data in the field of drugs with data for 1999 with a view to the final evaluation of the Action Plan;       a conference could be organised in 2004 to involve civil society in the future development of EU drugs policy.      The Commission will prepare a communication on the final evaluation of the Action Plan by the end of 2004.      COORDINATION ON DRUGS       Communication of 12 November 2003 from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on coordination on drugs in the European Union [         COM (2003) 681        final - Official Journal C 96, 21.4.2004].      The Commission, wishing to boost coordination on drugs at European Union level, explains what is needed and what is at stake, pointing to the main existing models of coordination and emphasising the key elements of effective interaction. It recommends, in particular, incorporating all aspects of drug-related policy (social and health aspects, law enforcement measures, youth policy), close cooperation between law-enforcement bodies and coordination between them and social and heath services, and systematic evaluation of strategies and activities in this field.      IMPLEMENTATION       Communication of 8 June 2001 from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the implementation of the EU Action Plan on Drugs (2000-2004) [         COM(2001) 301        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      The main purpose of the communication is to suggest measures to facilitate the evaluation of the Action Plan on Drugs, to outline the method which the Commission intends to use for the evaluation, and to present a number of measures already undertaken as part of the Plan. The communication draws on contributions from the EMCDDA and Europol.     For the purpose of assessing the extent to which the activities proposed in the Action Plan have actually been carried out, the Commission proposes a new instrument - a follow-up table - to ensure proper evaluation.     The evaluation of the impact on drugs and drug addiction will partly depend on information supplied by EMCDDA and Europol. These two organisations have already set up two working groups on impact assessment criteria. However, the Commission notes that, because of the lack of reliable and comparable data on the epidemiological and criminal aspects, the mid-term evaluation of the Action Plan (in 2002) will be limited to the extent to which the Action Plan activities have been carried out.     As regards future enlargement, stepping up the fight against drugs in the applicant countries remains a priority for the Commission. It has launched numerous initiatives in recent years, including opening negotiations on the participation of applicant countries in the EMCDDA's REITOX network. The Commission also plans to set up a database which would bring together all of information about projects financed by the Member States or the Commission in the applicant countries, in order to avoid duplication.     The European Union will continue its important activities on the external front. Priority will be given to the main routes used for supplying drugs to the European Union (particularly the cocaine route and the heroin route).     Coordination between all those involved is an essential requirement in the fight against drugs. In line with the provisions of the action plan, the Commission has carried out a study of coordination mechanisms in this field. Its report will be presented shortly. There is a need for better coordination between the Member States and the Commission. The Commission will therefore present proposals at the level of the Council's Horizontal Drugs Group, with a view to the adoption of practical measures.     Last updated: 14.04.2005  
   Framework programme on solidarity and management of migration flows for the period 2007-2013     Framework programme on solidarity and management of migration flows for the period 2007-2013     The framework programme is designed to improve management of migratory flows at the level of the European Union and to strengthen solidarity between Member States. It has four dimensions. The first concerns integrated management of external borders, with the setting up of an External Borders Fund. The second concerns asylum policy, with the prolongation of the European Refugee Fund. The third concerns the social, civic and cultural integration of Non-EU Member Country nationals, with the setting up of a European Integration Fund. The fourth concerns the fight against illegal immigration and the return of Non-EU Member Country nationals residing illegally in the EU, with the setting up of a European Return Fund.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament establishing a framework programme on solidarity and management of migration flows for the period 2007-2013 [       COM(2005) 123      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The framework programme will establish financial solidarity mechanisms covering four areas:      controls and surveillance of external borders;       return of Non-EU Member Country nationals residing illegally in the EU;       integration of legally resident Non-EU Member Country nationals;       asylum.      The communication, which maps out the broad lines of the framework programme, is accompanied by four proposals that constitute the instruments setting up four funds corresponding to each of the four policy areas.     The overall amount envisaged for the framework programme "Solidarity and management of migratory flows" is EUR 5 866 million for the period 2007-2013. The following amounts will also be provided:      EUR 285.1 million for the         FRONTEX Agency        ;       EUR 900 million for the implementation of large-scale information systems;       EUR 62.3 million for the setting up of a European Migration Observatory.        European Refugee Fund (ERF)       This proposal presses ahead with the implementation of the second stage of the ERF, which was launched by a decision of December 2004 and covers the period 2005-2010.     It sets out to harmonise the ERF schedule with those proposed for the other three instruments. Its duration is extended until 2013 and the new provisions will enter into force on 1 January 2008 so as to allow the multiannual programming cycle provided for by the decision of December 2004 to be applied in full. This will result in a third multiannual programme (2011-2013).      External Frontiers Fund      The Hague Programme underlines the need for a fair sharing of responsibility between Member States regarding the management and surveillance of external borders. This proposal is in response to this request and lays down four main policy objectives for burden sharing between the Member States and the European Union.     In order to express the notion of solidarity, the bulk of the allocations to the Member States would be determined on the basis of a distribution key defining the relative share of Member States.      European Integration Fund      This project follows on from pilot integration projects carried out in 2002. These initiatives, known as INTI, have proved very fruitful. This is the reason why the Commission launched the idea of a European Integration Fund at an interministerial conference on integration during the Dutch Presidency.      European Return Fund      In       The Hague Programme      the European Council called for the establishment of a European Return Fund. This proposal is in response to that request.      Background      The framework programme is designed to improve management of migratory flows at European Union level and to strengthen solidarity between Member States. It forms part of the Financial Perspective 2007-2013. Its objective is to ensure multiannual EU programming in different areas (integrated border management and asylum, integration and return policies).     The programme follows on from current programmes (such as the ERF), previous programmes (       Argo      and       Odysseus      ) and preparatory actions (such as the INTI).     RELATED ACTS      Commission Decision         2008/22/EC        of 19 December 2007 laying down rules for the implementation of Decision No         573/2007/EC        of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European Refugee Fund for the period 2008 to 2013 as part of the General programme "Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows" as regards Member States' management and control systems, the rules for administrative and financial management and the eligibility of expenditure on projects co-financed by the Fund [Official Journal L 17 of 10.1.2008]      This decision provides a whole range of additional information on the decisions establishing the European Refugee Fund, the External Borders Fund, the European Return Fund and the European Fund for the Integration of Non-EU Member Country Nationals. It gives details relating to the implementation of these decisions, particularly as regards designated authorities, information to be provided by the Member States to the Commission, reporting of irregularities and personal data.

summary of   Communication (COM(2012) 22 final — Trade, growth and development — Tailoring trade and investment policy for those countries most in need    EU strategy on ‘Aid for Trade’: enhancing EU support for trade-related needs in developing countries   what is the aim of the communication and the strategy   The communication suggests actions to help  least-developed countries  (LDCs), and other countries most in need, to gain the benefits of trade for inclusive growth and  sustainable development  .   The strategy on ‘  Aid for Trade  ’  *  (AfT) aims to improve the integration of developing countries and LDCs into the world trading system.   The strategy was designed to be in line with the objectives of the  United Nations  (UN)  Millennium Development Goals  , since replaced by the  Sustainable Development Goals  for 2030.   key points   The communication highlights the role of the following trade and development instruments for the benefit of developing countries and LDCs:   the  generalised scheme of preferences (GSP)  , which allows developing countries to pay lower or no duties on their exports to the EU. A revised GSP, which has a greater focus on least-developed countries, entered into force in 2014;   the boosting of bilateral and regional relations with developing countries, such as  free trade agreements  with countries in Asia, Latin America, Europe’s Eastern neighbourhood and the southern Mediterranean;   promoting  foreign direct investment  in developing countries and LDCs;   assistance to small traders in developing countries and LDCs to help them better access the European Union (EU) market via, for example, the  Export Helpdesk  ;   emphasising the importance of  good governance  in developing countries; it seeks to   stimulate trade and investment   ensure that the poorest people also benefit from the economic growth resulting from trade and   secure the sustainability of their development.     The  strategy  sets out a series of  priorities  :    boosting the overall AfT  provided by the EU under its development aid commitments;    increasing the impact  of resources provided by the EU and EU countries to developing countries and LDCs by improving their collaboration and coordination;   encouraging  regional integration  between the  African, Caribbean and Pacific States  (ACP) and focusing action on poverty reduction;    reinforcing progress monitoring  . For this purpose, the  European Commission  produces an  annual monitoring report on EU AfT  .    Financing:    The  European Development Fund (EDF)  for ACP countries.   The  Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI)  for other developing countries.   The  Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA II)  where it covers developing countries, such as Turkey, which is the largest recipient of EU AfT.    Additional points:   The use of trade as a tool for inclusive growth and sustainable development is also highlighted in the 2011 communication ‘  Increasing the Impact of EU Development Policy: an Agenda for Change  ’; and emphasised further in the 2012 communication ‘  Trade, growth and development — Tailoring trade and investment policy for those countries most in need  ’.   background    Many developing countries face an array of obstacles when it comes to international trade, such as poor infrastructure, poor trade diversification, inefficient customs procedures or excessive red tape. As developing countries now account for over 50% of global trade, there is much to be gained from overcoming these obstacles: from improved business environments to global poverty reduction.   The strategy falls under the framework of the  Doha Development Agenda  , adopted by the  World Trade Organisation  .   For more information, see:    ‘Aid for Trade’  on the European Commission's website.     * key terms     Aid for Trade (AfT):  aid that helps partner countries take advantage of opportunities created by unilateral, bilateral or multilateral trade agreements.   main documents    EU Strategy on Aid for Trade  : Enhancing EU support for trade-related needs in developing countries — Conclusions of the Council and of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States meeting within the Council, 29 October 2007  Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee — Trade, growth and development — Tailoring trade and investment policy for those countries most in need (  COM(2012) 22 final  , 27.1.2012)
   A broad-based innovation strategy for the EU     A broad-based innovation strategy for the EU     In response to a request from the European Council, this Communication sets out a broad-based innovation strategy for Europe, following on from the Communication "More Research and Innovation - Investing for growth and employment" and the recommendations in the report "Creating an Innovative Europe". The Commission says the European Union (EU) must become an innovation-based society. The main objective is to lay down a framework for promoting all types of innovation and encouraging the development of innovation-friendly lead markets. The EU has exceptional innovation potential, however this potential is under-exploited and the European regulatory and economic framework is not conducive enough to innovation.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 13 September 2006 "Putting knowledge into practice: A broad-based innovation strategy for the EU" [       COM(2006) 502      final Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     To be able to compete, Europe must become more inventive, innovate more and react better to consumers' needs and preferences. A comprehensive strategy is proposed to achieve this.     The European Union has already taken significant steps:      the         Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs        of 2005 sets out policies and reforms to make Europe's regulatory and economic framework more innovation-friendly;       the Commission         Communication        of October 2005 "         More Research and Innovation        " sets out a programme of 19 fields of action for the EU and the Member States;       the         National Reform Programmes        , based on the         Integrated Guidelines        of the 2005 Lisbon Strategy, encourage the Member States to take targeted measures to promote innovation, using the Structural Funds.      In spite of these initiatives, the EU economy is still not the innovative world economy that it should be. The report "Creating an Innovative Europe" (the Aho report) recommends urgent action to better exploit the EU's innovation potential. According to the report, the business environment must be made more innovation-friendly. The Commission also thinks that innovation must be part of the core societal values and that citizens should not fear it but understand that it works for the benefit of all of society.     Against this background, the Communication is designed to:      provide a framework for discussions on innovation at national and European level;       identify new areas for action;       introduce a strategy to facilitate the creation and marketing of new innovative products and services in promising areas.       A more innovative European Union       Education      is essential for the creation of an innovation-oriented society. The EU and its Member States must therefore facilitate the modernisation and restructuring of their education systems so that they can provide the skills required for innovation, in particular entrepreneurial skills as well as literacy, scientific and mathematical competence, languages and digital literacy.     The EU lacks       appropriate skills      , in particular in the field of science and engineering, and the absolute number of science and technology graduates is falling. This must therefore be rectified so as not to undermine the future capacity of Europe to innovate.     Transnational and structural       mobility      (between universities and industry) is also important to enable       researchers      to acquire new knowledge and find new applications. An       open and competitive labour market      for researchers must therefore be created.     Barriers hampering the EU's innovation potential persist in the internal market. They affect:      goods and services;       consumers seeking access to them;       the mobility of workers; and       the availability of venture capital.      The service sector offers a major opportunity for innovation which must be exploited (the sector accounts for more than two thirds of GDP and employment). The creation of a real       internal market for services      and support for the funding and creation of innovative SMEs in the service sector should enable this opportunity to be seized.     The       regulatory environment      must be improved. Innovation calls for predictable, flexible, simple and effective regulation that reinforces consumer confidence, protects intellectual property and provides open and interoperable standards. The worldwide success of European business depends on the rapid adoption of such standards. As regards the protection of intellectual property, the Commission sees the adoption of a       Community patent      which is effective and affordable for business as the most important step. In the meantime, implementation of the London Protocol will help to improve the situation for business as regards intellectual property rights (IPRs). Better enforcement of IPRs on foreign markets is also crucial.     All the public and private stakeholders (business, the public sector and consumers) must be involved in the innovation process. Cooperation between them must be encouraged, in particular in the following forms:       clusters         *        in which businesses form part of a whole and interact with one another. Among other things they enhance productivity, promote research and become a focus for developing skills. The Community instruments support cluster policy because they promote innovation. Major transnational European cooperation, across national borders, should help to generate world-class European clusters;        knowledge transfer        between the public research base and industry must be improved;        strategic partnerships between business and universities        . These partnerships must be strengthened to bridge the cultural gap between university research and business needs;       the         European Institute of Technology (EIT)        , which the Commission would like to see set up to form an integrated partnership of science, business and education for developing a new model for innovation. Students, researchers and businesses will work together in knowledge and innovation communities, in particular to develop know-how in key areas and enhance research and innovation management skills.      Innovation and research require major financial support. The national targets for research could raise the level of research and development investment across the EU if met. Some Community measures are also designed to provide better funding for research and innovation:      the         Seventh Framework Programme        which will boost the funding for collaborative research in the period 2007-2013;        Joint Technology Initiatives (JTIs)        , which will provide a new funding framework for implementing RTD (research and technological development) agendas in those sectors determining industrial competitiveness;       earmarking a         large proportion of the EUR 308 billion from the Structural Funds        for investment in knowledge and innovation;       the         Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP)        , providing in particular for an increase of 60% in the financial instruments to support entrepreneurship and innovation;       the         Risk-Sharing Financial Facility (RSFF)        , which will support private investment in high-risk RTD and demonstration projects by means of loans and guarantees;       the         JEREMIE Initiative        (Joint European Resources for Micro-to-Medium Enterprises), which will help the Member States to develop financial instruments in favour of SMEs;       the         new state aid guidelines        for venture capital, which will enable the Member States to better target state aid on market deficiencies which hamper the provision of venture capital and prevent sufficient funding for research and innovation activities;       the         new framework for state aid        for R&D (research and development) and innovation, which will, in particular, enable the Member States to channel their spending into aid for young innovative businesses, innovation advisory and support services, the loan of qualified personnel, process and organisational innovation, and clusters;        tax incentives        for R&D and innovation.      The public sector itself must adopt innovative approaches and exploit new technologies in public administration, to lead the way in creating a more innovative society.      Lead markets      The EU must promote the emergence of       lead markets      to facilitate the marketing of innovative products and services in promising areas. The emergence of such markets is fuelled by the strong consumer demand for innovative products and services. The idea is to identify those sectors in which the removal of barriers will promote the creation of new markets. The stakeholders, in particular the European Initiative       INNOVA      and the Technology Platforms, will help to identify and remove specific obstacles to the emergence of innovation-friendly markets. Various areas are conducive to the emergence of lead markets, for example eco-innovation and construction, internal security and defence, transport, space applications and health.      Better European governance for innovation      Structural change to promote innovation must be managed by       political leadership      . The Member States must continue to recognise and support innovation as a key priority within the Partnership for Growth and Jobs. The Competitiveness Council is requested to regularly assess the impact of national innovation policies on competitiveness.     An       improved governance structure for innovation      is required to put in place the policies recommended in this Communication. It is essential to establish strong innovation systems in all Member States, building on innovation drivers such as education and knowledge transfer. National coordinating mechanisms established under the Lisbon process should be used by the Member States to monitor effective implementation of their innovation strategies. In the context of the Treaty-based multilateral surveillance, the governance structure of the renewed Lisbon Strategy provides a forum for policy discussions and the exchange of innovation best practice at Community level. The Commission's 2007 annual report will outline the progress achieved, based on the various thematic discussions on innovation in the Council in 2006. Lastly, integrated guidelines should be adopted to guide the process over a three-year cycle, and the Commission will assess the Member States' reforms and policies in the field of innovation.      Roadmap      Ten actions are prioritised under the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs:      an increase in the Member States' public spending on         education        and innovation promotion via the education system and the modernisation of universities;       setting up a         European Institute of Technology        , to be operational by 2009;       development and implementation of a strategy by the Community and the Member States to create an         open European labour market for researchers        ;       promotion of         knowledge transfer        between universities, public research organisations and industry;       mobilisation of the EU's         cohesion policy        for the period 2007-2013 in support of innovation, including the earmarking of an ambitious proportion of the available funding;       adoption by the Commission of a new framework for         state aid        for research, development and innovation by the end of 2006, enabling state aid to be re-oriented and targeted at these objectives;       presentation by the Commission of a new         patent strategy        and preparation of a more comprehensive         IPR (intellectual property rights) strategy        ;       development of an initiative on "copyright levies" to provide a legal framework for         copyright        which is more conducive to the development of new products and services;       introduction of a strategy in 2007 to facilitate the emergence of         lead markets        ;       publication by the end of 2006 of a         handbook        on how public procurement can stimulate innovation.        Key terms used in the act         Clusters: business groupings in the same sector of activity.       Last updated: 24.04.2007  
summary of   Regulation (EC) No 595/2009 on type-approval of motor vehicles and engines (with respect to emissions from heavy-duty vehicles and access to vehicle repair and maintenance information)   what is the aim of the regulation   It defines the rules for type-approval of motor vehicles, engines and replacement parts for heavy-duty vehicles (lorries, buses and coaches) with respect to their emission performance. It also establishes rules on:   in-service conformity of vehicles and engines;   durability of pollution-control devices;   on-board diagnostic (OBD) systems;   accessibility of vehicle OBD and vehicle repair and maintenance information;   measurement of fuel consumption and CO  2  emissions.     It repeals Directives  80/1269/EEC  ,  2005/55/EC  and  2005/78/EC  with effect from 31 December 2013.   Regulation (EU)  2018/858  (see  summary  ), which applies from  1 September 2020  , amends Regulation (EC) No 595/2009 by removing the references in it regarding access to  vehicle OBD and vehicle repair and maintenance information  .   key points    Scope   This regulation applies to motor vehicles of categories M  1  , M  2  , N  1  and N  2  with a reference mass exceeding 2,610 kg and to all motor vehicles of categories M  3  and N  3  as defined in Annex II of Directive  2007/46/EC  (see  summary  ).   Manufacturer obligations   Manufacturers must:   be able to demonstrate that all new vehicles, engines or spare parts sold, registered or put into service in the EU have been type-approved in accordance with this regulation;   implement technical measures to guarantee effective limitation of exhaust-pipe emissions throughout the normal life of the vehicles under normal conditions of use.    Requirements and tests   Manufacturers must equip their vehicles or engines with components that ensure compliance with the emission limits laid down in Annex I of this regulation under conditions specified by the  European Commission  in this regulation and in the implementing acts.   Access to information    Manufacturers must:   guarantee  independent operators  (i.e. businesses which are independent from authorised dealers and repairers of a given vehicle brand) access to information on OBD systems and on diagnostic equipment, tools or software;   provide a  standardised, secure and remote facility  to enable independent repairers to complete operations which involve access to the vehicle security system.     The information should be made available on  manufacturers' websites  , or, if this is not feasible, in another appropriate format.   It should be noted, however, as of  1 September 2020  , all rules relating to  vehicle repair and maintenance information  will be found in  Chapter XIV  of Regulation (EU) 2018/858.    Timetable   National authorities must no longer grant EU or national type-approval for vehicles that do not comply with this regulation as from 31 December 2012. They must prohibit the registration of new vehicles that do not comply with this regulation as from 31 December 2013.   Financial incentives    Countries may grant financial incentives for the  purchase of motor vehicles produced in series  which comply with this regulation until 31 December 2013.  Retrofitting measures  may also be considered either to adapt in-use motor vehicles or for scrapping.   The amount of the financial incentives must be equal to the additional cost of the technical measures introduced to ensure compliance of the vehicle with emission limits.    Implementing legislation    Implementing acts  contain measures to implement Regulation (EC) No 595/2009:   Commission Regulation (EU) No  582/2011  sets out the  specific technical requirements  for the approval of heavy-duty vehicles with regard to emissions and access to vehicle repair and maintenance information.   Commission Regulation (EU)  2017/2400  (see  summary  ) complements the legal rules established by Regulation (EU) No 582/2011. It lays down the rules for:    certifying truck components  with an impact on CO  2  emissions and the fuel consumption of vehicles;   issuing  licences to perform simulations  to determine CO  2  emissions and fuel consumption of new vehicles to be sold, registered or put into service in the EU;    operating simulation tools  and  declaring the CO  2  emissions and fuel consumption values  that they determine.     from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 7 August 2009. However, some of the amendments to Directive 2007/46/EC included in Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 595/2009 have applied since 31 December 2013.   background   The  Seventh Environment Action Programme  highlights the need to reduce air pollution. This regulation contributes to its objectives in terms of air quality by establishing a system which constrains the automobile industry to limit the emissions from the vehicles that it produces.  For more information, see:    Reducing CO  2  emissions from Heavy-Duty Vehicles  (  European Commission  ).   main documents   Regulation (EC) No  595/2009  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2009 on type-approval of motor vehicles and engines with respect to emissions from heavy-duty vehicles (Euro VI) and on access to vehicle repair and maintenance information and amending Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 and Directive 2007/46/EC and repealing Directives 80/1269/EEC, 2005/55/EC and 2005/78/EC (OJ L 188, 18.7.2009, pp. 1-13)  Successive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 595/2009 have been incorporated into the original text.

   Common organisation of the market in olive oil and table olives     Common organisation of the market in olive oil and table olives     This Regulation sets up a common organisation of the market in olive oil and table olives. The support scheme for these products is covered by the "       Mediterranean package      " which is part of the major reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP) of June 2003 with its provisions for the hop, cotton, olive and tobacco sectors. It remains in force until 30 June 2008.     ACT     Council Regulation (EC) No       865/2004      on the common organisation of the market in olive oil and table olives and amending Regulation (EEC) No       827/68      .     SUMMARY     As from 1 July 2008, products falling under the scope of this Regulation will be covered by the       common organisation of agricultural markets      .     This Regulation is part of the "       Mediterranean package      " and contains far-reaching amendments to the common organisation of the market in olive oil and table olives.     It provides for a system of intervention within the framework of the internal market and certain support measures for European products when they are traded on the world markets.      Scope      This common organisation of the market covers:      olive oil and its fractions;       fresh olives and olives which have undergone processing such as chilling, cooking, pickling;       oil-cake and other olive residues.       Single payment      The common organisation of the market in olive oil and table olives has undergone drastic change in that it has partly changed over to the       single farm payment      scheme. This scheme will apply to the common organisation of the market in olive oil and table olives for the 2005-06 marketing year.      Marketing year      The marketing year starts on 1 July each year and ends on 30 June of the following year. However, the 2005/06 marketing year began on 1 November 2005.      INTERNAL MARKET       Marketing standards      Olive oil and other oils obtained from olive oil may be subject to marketing standards. These standards apply in particular to quality grading, packaging and presentation.      Intervention      In the event of a serious disturbance of the market in the European Union or some of its regions, the Commission may authorise storage. The storage mechanism is used in particular when, for a long period of time, the average price recorded on the market is less than:      EUR 1 779 per tonne for extra virgin olive oil         *        ;       EUR 1 710 per tonne for virgin olive oil         *        ;       EUR 1 524 per tonne for lampante olive oil         *        having 2 degrees of free acidity (this amount will be reduced by EUR 36.70 per tonne for each additional degree of acidity).       Operators' organisations      Professional or operators' organisations may draw up work programmes for the purpose of improving the market in olive oil and olives with regard to product quality, environmental impact, information and administrative management.     Funding for these initiatives ranges from 50% to 100% of the maximum amounts for       direct aid      . Member States may finance up to 50% of the costs not covered by Community funding.      TRADE WITH THIRD COUNTRIES       Issuing of import licences      Imports of certain products are subject to the presentation of import licences issued by Member States. Export licences may also become necessary to counter certain market developments.      Common Customs Tariff      The Common Customs Tariff applies to all products involved. However, if the market price significantly exceeds the average prices for a period of at least three months, certain derogations may enter into force.      Barriers to trade      Charges having an effect equivalent to customs duty and quantitative restrictions on imports or equivalent measures are normally prohibited in trade with third countries. The use of inward processing arrangements may be prohibited.      Safeguard measures      If there is a risk that imports will cause disturbances in the market, safeguard measures may be adopted for all products, provided the Community's international obligations are also met.      OTHER PROVISIONS       The price of other vegetable oils      Member States may not increase the price of other vegetable oils so as to ensure an outlet for nationally produced olive oil.      Communication      The Member States and the Commission are to exchange any necessary information concerning the implementation of the Regulation and the respect of international obligations relating to olive oil and olives.      Committee procedures      The Commission will be assisted in its implementation of the Regulation by a Management Committee for Olive Oil and Table Olives (       FR      ), made up of representatives from the Member States and chaired by a member of the Commission staff.     This common organisation of the market replaces the one relating to       oils and fats      .      Background      The reform of the common organisation of the market in olive oil and table olives was negotiated as part of the “Mediterranean package” (       hops      ,       cotton      ,       tobacco      ), but became the subject of a separate Regulation. In a second phase (April 2004) these products were integrated into the major CAP reform of June 2003, with the approval of the changeover from the system of direct payments (where aid was given per hectare, per unit of quantity or per animal) to the single farm payment scheme.     In 2007, this common organisation of the market was subsumed under the single common organisation of the market (l67001), which replaced the 21 individual systems in place for various sectors and simplified the legislative framework for the       common agriculture policy      .       Key terms of the act         Extra virgin olive oil: virgin olive oil having a maximum free acidity, in terms of oleic acid, of 0.8 grammes per 100 grammes.         Virgin olive oil: virgin olive oil having a maximum free acidity, in terms of oleic acid, of 2 grammes per 100 grammes.         Lampante olive oil: virgin olive oil having a maximum free acidity, in terms of oleic acid, of more than 2 grammes per 100 grammes.

act   Commission  Regulation (EU) No 316/2014  of 21 March 2014 on the application of Article 101(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to categories of technology transfer agreements.   summary   Under  intellectual property  law, holders of intellectual property rights are granted certain exclusive rights. These permit them to prevent unauthorised use of their intellectual property as well as to exploit their property, in particular by licensing it to third parties. Technology transfer agreements concern the  licensing of technology  and may be bilateral or multilateral (‘patent pools’*).  In March 2014, the European Commission adopted a Technology Transfer Block Exemption Regulation (TTBER), replacing a  2004 text  . It clarifies how EU competition law (in this case,  Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU  ) applies to certain categories of licensing agreements and the criteria used to assess these agreements. Like its predecessors, it is accompanied by guidelines which provide guidance on the application of the rules.   Scope and exemptions   The TTBER exempts licensing agreements between companies that have  limited market power  (i.e. market share of under 20 % for agreements between competitors and 30 % for agreements between non-competitors), and that  fulfil certain conditions  . These are deemed to have no anti-competitive effects or that, if they do, the positive effects outweigh the negative ones and thus do not contravene EU  antitrust rules  .  The TTBER only applies to research and development (R & D) agreements if the specific block exemption regulations (BERs) on  R & D agreements  and on  specialisation agreements*  are not applicable.  The TTBER applies only to  bilateral agreements  ; the guidelines also cover  patent pools  .   Main changes introduced:    a new  test  to determine whether certain clauses in a technology transfer agreement (in particular concerning purchases of raw material or equipment from a licensor or the use of the licensor’s trademark) are exempted from Article 101 of the TFEU, together with the technology transfer agreement itself;    passive sales restrictions*  between licensees are added to the list of ‘hardcore’ restrictions listed in Article 4 (practices deemed so serious that they, together with the rest of the agreement in which they are found, are excluded from the safe harbour of a BER) and can never be exempted by the TTBER;   all  exclusive grant-back obligations*  will fall outside the  TTBER safe harbour  (non-exclusive grant-back obligations however remain covered);    termination clauses  allowing the licensor to terminate the license agreement if the other party challenges the validity of the licensed technology will fall outside the TTBER safe harbour.    Application   The new rules apply not only to agreements concluded after its entry into force (1 May 2014). Agreements under the previous regime had to be adapted to the new rules by  30 April 2015  .   background   Following the COVID-19 outbreak and introducing measures to cope with the impact of the crisis, the European Commission adopted:   Communication from the Commission — Temporary Framework for assessing antitrust issues related to business cooperation in response to situations of urgency stemming from the current COVID-19 outbreak   key terms    *Technology transfer agreement  : an agreement governing the transfer of skills, technology and techniques between two or more parties.   * Block exemption  : under these regulations, the European Commission can declare specific categories of State aid compatible with the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU if they fulfil certain conditions. This exempts them from the requirement of prior notification and Commission approval.   * Patent pools  : an agreement between two or more patent owners to license one or more of their patents to one another or to third parties.   * Specialisation agreements  : these aim to promote cooperation between firms in the area of specialisation in the production of goods and the supply of services.   * Passive sales restrictions  : passive selling is when a party responds to unsolicited requests from individual customers.   * Grant-back obligations  : in a licensing agreement, a licensee may be required to disclose and transfer all improvements made (including related know-how acquired) in the licensed technology during the licensing period.

   Plan D for Democracy, Dialogue and Debate     Plan D for Democracy, Dialogue and Debate     On 13 October 2005 the European Commission launched its Plan D for Democracy, Dialogue and Debate as a foundation for a debate on the future of the European Union (EU). Plan D seeks to foster communication and debate on the activities of the EU by addressing the need to listen to citizens' expectations.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. "The Commission's contribution to the period of reflection and beyond: Plan-D for Democracy, Dialogue and Debate" [       COM(2005) 494      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The European Commission's       Plan D      for Democracy, Dialogue and Debate sets out a process aimed at encouraging wider debate on the future of the EU, between the EU institutions and citizens.      Objectives      A debate on the future of Europe should address the needs and expectations of citizens in order to maintain trust and involvement in representative democracy.       Plan D      is therefore about dialogue, debate and listening to citizens' needs and expectations. It also seeks to encourage communication on the activities of the EU by addressing target audiences, (for example young people), and using mass media, like television and the internet, the latter as an interactive forum for political debate. A specific Eurobarometer survey on the future of Europe will be presented by the European Commission in order to learn from the concerns expressed by citizens.      Plan D      should result in a new consensus on the European project and basically addresses two issues:      assisting national debates on the future of Europe ;       presenting initiatives to         strengthen dialogue, public debate and citizen participation        .       Assisting national debates on the future of Europe      National debates should focus on examining and discussing the added value and benefits for citizens of concrete achievements and projects of the EU.     The European Commission emphasises its wish to assist Member States in the organisation of events aimed at raising the profile of citizen participation in these Europe-wide debates. Co-operation with other EU institutions and bodies as well as national, regional and local parliaments plays an important role in this respect.      Initiatives to strengthen dialogue, public debate and citizen's participation       Plan D      proposes 13 specific EU initiatives and actions in order to strengthen and stimulate dialogue, public debate and citizen's participation. The European Commission is to play a significant role in these initiatives, in partnership with the other European institutions and bodies.     Specific EU actions include visits by commissioners to Member States and national parliaments, support for citizens' projects, a drive for more openness over Council meetings, the creation of a network of "European Goodwill Ambassadors" to raise the profile of the European debate, as well as support for projects to increase voter participation.      Feedback process      A feedback process on the results of the national debates will take place in 2006 in order to let citizens' participation have a direct impact on the political agenda of the EU. The feedback will take the form of a set of conclusions and an overall synthesis of the outcome of national debates, as well as the organisation of a European Conference on the future of Europe on 9 May 2006.      Background      After the rejection of the European Constitution by French and Dutch voters in June 2005, the Heads of State and Government called for a "period of reflection" in order to enable Member States to initiate national debates on the future of Europe. Plan D seeks to facilitate this process of national debate by putting in place a framework for dialogue and debate.     Plan D will be implemented in combination with an       Action Plan (        pdf        ),      adopted by the Commission on 20 July 2005, to improve communication about the future of Europe       .

   Parts and characteristics of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors     Parts and characteristics of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors     This Directive defines the legal framework intended to ensure compliance with safety rules in the design and construction of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors. It thus contributes to the free circulation of this category of products in the internal market.     ACT     Directive       2009/63/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on certain parts and characteristics of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors (codified version) (Text with EEA relevance).     SUMMARY     This Directive lays down technical prescriptions concerning the design and construction of agricultural or forestry tractors. These prescriptions concern:      the maximum permissible laden mass;       the location and fitting of the rear registration plates;       fuel tanks;       ballast weights;       audible warning devices;       permissible sound levels;       exhaust systems (silencers).       Definition      A tractor (agricultural or forestry) is specially designed to tow, push, carry or power certain tools, machinery or trailers intended for agricultural or forestry use. The term includes any motor vehicle fitted with wheels or endless tracks and having at least two axles.     A tractor may be equipped to carry a load and passengers.     This Directive shall apply to tractors which are equipped with pneumatic tyres and have a maximum design speed of between 6 and 40 km/h.      Granting of EC type-approval      Member States shall grant EC type-approval (which certifies that a type of vehicle, system or equipment satisfies the technical prescriptions required for its entry into service) or national type-approval if tractors satisfy all of the above prescriptions. Failing this, Member States may consider the certificates provided as not valid and may refuse the registration, sale or entry into service of the vehicle.     This Directive repeals Directive       74/151/EC      .

act    ruling of the european court of justice    Case C-131/12  : Judgment of the Court (Grand Chamber) of 13 May 2014 - Google Spain SL, Google Inc. v Agencia Española de Protección de Datos (AEPD), Mario Costeja González. Reference for a preliminary ruling: Audiencia Nacional - Spain. Personal data - Protection of individuals with regard to the processing of such data - Directive 95/46/EC - Articles 2, 4, 12 and 14 - Material and territorial scope - Internet search engines - Processing of data contained on websites - Searching for, indexing and storage of such data - Responsibility of the operator of the search engine - Establishment on the territory of a Member State - Extent of that operator’s obligations and of the data subject’s rights - Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union - Articles 7 and 8 (  OJ C 212 of 7.7.2014, pp. 4-5  ).   summary    what does the ruling do  European Union (EU)  legislation  on personal data protection is designed to balance two aims: to respect the fundamental right to protect personal data and to remove obstacles from the free flow of data.  The right to data protection needs to be reconciled with other rights, such as freedom of expression and media freedom.  The European Court of Justice gave a landmark ruling on 13 May 2014, in a case involving Google. It sets out ways the specific aspects of the right to data protection, such as the right to erasure, should be exercised. The ruling empowers individuals to take control of their personal data.   key points   The Court stated that an internet search engine operator is responsible for processing the personal data which appear on web pages published by other sources. Operating a search engine is a different activity to that of publishing content on a website, and search results can undermine a person’s right to privacy. Thus, the operator acts as a processor of personal data and must comply with legislation that protects individuals in this regard (  Directive 95/46/EC  ).  The Court ruled that the search engine operator could, in some circumstances, be obliged to remove links to certain web pages from the list of results that appear when a search is conducted for a particular name. That obligation may exist even if the person’s name or information has not been erased from the website.  According to the Court, the right of data subjects to be excluded from results displayed following a search made on the basis of their name applies where the information is inaccurate, inadequate, irrelevant, no longer relevant or excessive for the purposes of data processing.  The assessment of individual requests for removal, made on a case-by-case basis by search engine operators, must balance the interests of the person involved and the public interest to have access to the information via name-based search queries.  Different factors must be taken into account when deciding whether the public interest prevails over an individual’s interests, in particular the role that the individual plays in public life. The ruling does not give the all-clear to people or organisations to have search results removed from the web simply because they find them inconvenient.  Independent national data protection authorities oversee the assessments carried out by search engine operators.   background   In 2010, Mario Costeja González, a Spanish citizen, requested that Google remove or conceal in search results the personal data on him printed in the newspaper  La Vanguardia  in January and March 1998. These related to social security debts. He maintained the proceedings had been resolved for several years and that reference to them had become irrelevant.  The case was referred to the Court of Justice by a Spanish court.

   Overhaul for EU Solidarity Fund     Overhaul for EU Solidarity Fund     Thanks to an overhaul of its special emergency fund - the EU Solidarity Fund - the European Union is now able to provide assistance for current and future members who suffer major disasters. The Commission is proposing a new Regulation that will broaden the scope and improve the operation of the Fund. These changes are a necessary response to growing threats from events such as acts of terrorism, epidemics and industrial disasters.     PROPOSAL     Proposal for a European Parliament and Council Regulation of 6 April 2005 establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund [       COM(2005) 108      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The Regulation proposed by the Commission aims to equip the EU to respond appropriately to a range of major disasters, including       public health emergencies      . Set to enter into force in January 2007, it will replace the legislation governing the current version of the EU Solidarity Fund (EUSF) (       Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002      ).     The fund will now be able to channel emergency financial assistance to Member States and those countries currently negotiating EU membership. The use of the Fund to assist countries that are not (yet) Member States is based on a specific provision in the Treaty of Nice governing economic and financial cooperation with non-EU countries.      Scope of the Fund      The EU will provide financial assistance in cases where the extent of the damage caused by a disaster is such that it hampers a country's ability to respond effectively.     The current Regulation proposal broadens the scope of EUSF assistance, which has so far been limited to natural disasters. From now on, the EU will also be able to react to industrial and technological disasters, public health emergencies and       acts of terrorism      .     The extent of a disaster will be determined according to:      a quantitative criterion, when the amount of direct damage is estimated to be either 1 billion or more (in 2007) or 0.5 % of the affected country's gross national income. This new threshold makes more cases eligible for aid from the Fund. Regional and local disasters causing damage at a level below this threshold are the responsibility of the Member State concerned, although they may be eligible for assistance from other Community funds;       a political criterion, which will allow the Commission to propose the Fund be used for emergencies in cases where the material damage alone would not normally qualify for assistance. This is particularly useful for dealing with the consequences of acts of terrorism and epidemics.      Having a single fund focussing solely on large-scale disasters will ensure the aid is as effective as possible.      Emergency assistance      EUSF aid will be granted to finance emergency measures by public authorities or bodies in Member States.     These include:      restoring essential infrastructure for power generation, water supplies and sewage, telecommunications, transport, health and education;       immediate medical assistance and measures to protect against imminent health threats, mainly by providing drugs, medical products and vaccines;       providing temporary accommodation and immediate disaster-relief measures for victims;       setting up emergency preventive systems;       emergency measures to protect the local culture and environment;       emergency clean-up operations in the disaster area;       medical, psychological and social assistance for direct victims of terrorism and their families      To receive aid, eligible countries must send a request to the Commission within ten weeks of the disaster.     The Commission will determine the appropriate amount of aid, which can never be more than 50 % of the total cost of the eligible operations, and ask the budgetary authority to release these funds. They can be paid as soon as the amounts have been entered in the Community budget and an implementation agreement concluded between the beneficiary country and the Commission.     There is also a new fast-track relief mechanism by which an advance of 5 % of the estimated amount (no more than EUR 5 million) can be paid for the most urgent measures.     Before 1 July every year, the Commission will present a report to the Parliament and the Council setting out the activities of the Solidarity Fund.

act   Directive  2014/24/EU  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on  public procurement  and repealing Directive 2004/18/EC.  Directive  2014/25/EU  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on procurement by entities operating in the  water, energy, transport and postal services sectors  and repealing Directive 2004/17/EC  Directive  2014/23/EU  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on the award of  concession contracts   summary   The transition to e-procurement is part of the modernisation of European rules on public purchasing. A package of three legislative texts was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in April 2014, and these texts enabled the realisation of this transition.   what is e-procurement  e-Procurement is the use by public sector bodies of electronic means to purchase supplies and services or to launch calls for tenders for public works.  Increased use of e-procurement in Europe enables:   the simplification of the functioning of procurement;   a reduction in the workload and costs;   increased participation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);   the emergence of better quality and lower prices.   a clear, simplified new legal framework   A new legal framework was adopted in April 2014 with a package of three new directives whose essential aims are:   to make e-procurement compulsory in certain phases of the procedure and for central purchasing bodies (which centralise orders in the name of the contracting authority); these measures should apply from April 2016 and should be implemented for all contracting authorities in the European Union (EU) from  October 2018  ;   to limit the technical barriers to cross-border submissions for public contracts.   The directives establish a clear legal framework which includes aspects in relation to the possible use of electronic signatures. In addition, the directives aim:   to strengthen the role of the  e-Certis  information system on the different certificates and attestations requested in procurement procedures in the 28 EU countries;   to provide for exemptions concerning the use of electronic means.   In addition, the directive on awarding concession contracts provides for a simplified system which makes e-procurement optional, even though e-notification is being made obligatory.   Context   In the  Single Market Act  , the Commission expressed its wish to modernise the EU legal framework relating to public procurement contracts. The economic value of this sector is considerable and the introduction of electronic processes will improve the effectiveness of public procurement contracts.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 273/2004 on drug precursors   what is the aim of the regulation   It implements the EU’s obligations under the  United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances  (1988) which requires measures to be taken to monitor the placing on the market of drug precursors  *  .   It lays down measures to control and monitor the trade of drug precursors within the EU.   It was amended by Regulation (EU) No  1258/2013  in particular to clarify certain terms used in the text, notably ‘scheduled substance’  *  , ‘user’  *  and ‘operator’  *  .   It is complemented by Regulation (EC) No  111/2005  (see  summary  ) covering the trade of drug precursors with non-EU countries.   Current status: three  delegated acts  (Regulations (EU)  2015/1011  , (EU)  2016/1443  and (EU)  2018/729  ) amending the regulation, as well as one  implementing act  (Regulation (EU)  2015/1013  ) have been adopted.   key points    The regulation distinguishes between  scheduled  and  non-scheduled   *   substances  .   There are  3 categories of scheduled substances  in  Annex I  of the regulation:    category 1: the most sensitive substances  , from which illicit drugs can be produced most easily (for example, 1-phenyl-2-propanone, ephedrine, piperonal);    category 2: less sensitive substances  (  subcategory 2A  : acetic anhydride;  subcategory 2B  : phenylacetic acid, anthranilic acid, piperidine and potassium permanganate);    category 3: bulk chemicals  which can have different types of uses in the manufacturing process (for example, acetone, hydrochloric acid).      Obligations of operators     Operators  wishing to place on the market  category 1 and 2 substances  must:   appoint an  officer  responsible for the trade in scheduled substances;   notify or update the  national competent authorities  of the details of the officer.     They must document and label all transactions and keep records for  3 years  .    Licence for category 1 substances    Operators and users must obtain a  licence  from the competent authorities of the EU country in which they are based before they may possess or place on the market  category 1  substances. The competent authorities may grant special licences to pharmacies, dispensaries of veterinary medicine, certain types of public authorities or the armed forces.   An operator holding a licence may only supply category 1 substances to operators or users who also hold a licence and have signed a  customer declaration  (see below).   Before granting a licence, the competent authorities must check the applicant’s competence and integrity.   The licence may be suspended or revoked by the authorities where there are reasonable grounds for believing that the holder is no longer a fit and proper person to hold a licence, or that the conditions under which the licence was granted are no longer fulfilled.    Registration for category 2 substances     Operators  must obtain registration from the competent authorities of the EU country in which they are established before placing on the market  category 2 substances  .   From 1 July 2015,  users  must obtain a registration from the authorities of the EU country in which they are established before possessing  subcategory 2A  substances. The authorities may grant special registrations to pharmacies, dispensaries of veterinary medicine, certain types of public authorities or the armed forces.   Any operator holding a registration may only supply  subcategory 2A  substances to other operators or users who also hold a registration  and  have signed a  customer declaration  (see below).    Detailed rules  on the  award of licences and registrations  are set out in  Regulation (EU) 2015/1011  .   Customer declaration    All operators who supply a customer with a category 1 or 2 substance must obtain a  declaration from the customer  which shows the  specific use or uses  of the scheduled substances. A separate declaration is required for each scheduled substance.   An operator supplying  category 1  substances must stamp and date a copy of the declaration, certifying it to be a true copy of the original. This copy must always accompany the substances being moved within the EU and be presented on request to the authorities.    Notification of the authorities     Operators  must:   notify the competent authorities immediately of any circumstances, such as unusual orders or transactions which suggest that substances might be diverted for the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances;   provide the competent authorities with relevant information in summary form about their transactions involving scheduled substances;   not disclose any personal data collected other than to the competent authorities.      EU countries’ competent authorities — powers and obligations    EU countries  must adopt measures  to enable their competent authorities to perform their control and monitoring duties. They  may also adopt measures  to enable their competent authorities to control and monitor suspicious transactions involving  non-scheduled substances  . In particular, these measures may include:   to obtain information on any orders for, or operations involving,  scheduled and non-scheduled substances  ,   to enter operators’ and users’ business premises to obtain evidence of irregularities,   where necessary, to detain and seize consignments that fail to comply with this regulation or to prevent the use of non-scheduled substances for the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances.     They must ensure competent authorities respect  confidential  business information and introduce and enforce  penalties  for infringing the rules.    European database    The regulation creates a  European database on drug precursors  . It serves to:   simplify the procedure for EU countries to report seizures and stopped shipments;   maintain a list of EU licensed or registered operators and users legally trading or using drug precursors;   enable operators to provide competent authorities with information in summary form about their transactions involving scheduled substances.      Implementing and delegated acts     Regulation (EU) 2015/1013  sets out rules on the licensing and registration of operators and users and their listing in the European database on drug precursors, the provision by operators of information required to monitor trade and authorisation of exports and imports in the field of drug precursors.    Regulation (EU) 2015/1011:    lays down conditions for granting licences and registrations;   determines cases where a licence or registration is not required;   establishes the criteria to demonstrate the legal purpose of a transaction;   determines the information required to monitor trade; and   specifies the requirements concerning the information to be provided on implementing the monitoring measures as regards trade in drug precursors.      Regulations (EU) 2016/1443  and  (EU) 2018/729  extend the list of category 1 substances.    Repeal   The regulation repeals Directive  92/109/EEC  , Directives  93/46/EEC  ,  2001/8/EC  and  2003/101/EC  and Regulations (EC) No  1485/96  and (EC) No  1533/2000  .   from when does the regulation apply   Regulation (EC) No 273/2004 has applied since 18 August 2005.   Amending Regulation (EU) No 1258/2013 has applied since 30 December 2013.   background   For more information, see:    Drug precursors control  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Drug precursor:  chemicals that are primarily used for the legitimate (legal) production of a wide range of products including medicines, plastics, and cosmetics. These substance may also be misused for illegal/illicit purposes, such as the production of methamphetamines, heroin or cocaine.   Scheduled substance:  any substance listed in Annex I of this regulation and is identified as having been used for the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances.   User:  a natural or legal person other than an operator (see next entry) who possesses a scheduled substance and is engaged in the processing, formulation, consumption, storage, keeping, treatment, filling into containers, transfer from one container to another, mixing, transformation or any other utilisation of scheduled substances.   Operator:  any natural or legal person engaged in the placing on the market of scheduled substances.   Non-scheduled substance:  any substance which, although not listed in Annex I of this regulation, is identified as having been used for the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances.

The       November 1998 Report      stressed that Poland had made progress in meeting the short-term priorities set by the Accession Partnership, particularly with regard to the restructuring of industry, but it also insisted on the need to continue to work towards the actual implementation of the restructuring programme for the steel industry.     The       October 1999 Report      indicated that the industrial policy adopted for the period 1999 to 2000 was based on the same principles as EU policy. However, there were areas where policy and practice had been divergent. There were delays in the transposition of legislation on technical standards, product safety and competition rules. Although Poland was continuing with the privatisation of industry, some sectors, in particular the steel industry, would probably continue to experience a number of difficulties. The results for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), however, were generally satisfactory and Poland had achieved a good level of conformity between its legislation and the Community acquis.     The       November 2000 Report      indicated that Poland had achieved much in the way of creating an appropriate legal environment in which businesses can operate, as reflected in the flow of foreign direct investment and by the rapid development of the private sector. Policies were usually well defined, but their implementation had been limited. Polish industry was still not very competitive. Further efforts were required in terms of innovation and privatisation, and to adjust Poland's regulatory environment to that of the Community. Privatisation of State-owned enterprises had played a very important role in the Polish economy by speeding up the restructuring process.     The       November 2001 Report      stressed that little progress has been made by Poland in the field of industrial policy. Greater importance has been attached to promoting investment. Privatisation and restructuring has continued. Significant efforts have, on the other hand, been made to implement a general policy in favour of SMEs. In addition to an increase in the budgetary allocation, there was also progress in terms of access to finance and improving the business environment.     The       October 2002 Report      stated that Poland had continued to make progress in the field of industrial policy and a policy in favour of SMEs.     The       November 2003 Report      considers that Poland is able to implement the acquis in the field of industrial policy and SME policy as of accession. Efforts still need to be made in the area of privatisation and restructuring.      COMMUNITY                  ACQUIS      EC industrial policy seeks to enhance competitiveness, thus achieving rising living standards and high rates of employment. Its aim is to encourage an environment favourable to initiative, to the development of undertakings throughout the Community and to industrial cooperation, and to foster better exploitation of the industrial potential of innovation, research and technological development policies. EC industrial policy combines instruments from a number of Community policies, and includes both instruments related to the operation of markets (product specification and market access, trade policy, State aid and competition policy) and measures related to industry's capacity to adapt to change (stable macro-economic environment, technology, training etc.).     In order to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union, the industry of applicant countries needs to have achieved a certain level of competitiveness by the time of accession. The applicant countries need to be seen as pursuing policies aimed at open and competitive markets along the lines set out in Article 157 (ex Article 130) of the EC Treaty. Cooperation between the EC and the candidate countries in the fields of industrial cooperation, investment, industrial standardisation and conformity assessment as provided for in the Europe Agreement is also an important indicator of development in the right direction.      EVALUATION      The development of       industrial policy      speeded up in 2002.     In terms of industrial strategy, a medium-term strategy for 2002-2005 has been drawn up by the government. The government also wants to improve the business environment and promote investment. An anti-crisis programme aimed at reducing unemployment and boosting economic growth was adopted in July 2002.     There have been developments with respect to restructuring and privatisation, although the pace of progress remains slow. Poland should, above all, ensure that the implementation of the restructuring policy conforms to the competition and State aid acquis. It is also urged to impart a new impetus to the privatisation of the remaining sectors and companies. The necessary administrative structures in this area should be reinforced.     Poland has made a lot of progress since the Commission's 1997 opinion and restructuring is underway. This chapter has been provisionally closed, no transitional arrangements have been requested and Poland has met its commitments (see the 2002 Report). Poland needs to make further progress in aligning its legislation with the acquis and in completing the restructuring process.     Poland has adopted the medium-term strategy for       SMEs      , which is mainly aimed at promoting entrepreneurship. Access to finance has been improved with the anti-crisis package. Poland adopted the European Charter for Small Enterprises in April 2002. Efforts have been made to facilitate the implementation of the policy in favour of SMEs, mainly through the merger of the Polish Agency for Enterprise Development and the Polish Agency for Regional Development.     The budget resources allocated to SMEs fell from 18 million euros in 2001 to 14 million euros in 2002. Other than that, there were few significant changes in the business environment for SMEs. Programmes in this field will need to be implemented effectively. The representation of the business community also needs to be strengthened.     Poland has made efforts since the 1997 opinion to introduce an SME policy which is close to the acquis. This chapter has been provisionally closed, no transitional arrangements have been requested and Poland has met its commitments (see the 2002 Report). Work will need to be carried out on improving the administrative structure and on ensuring the allocation of sufficient budgetary resources.     Poland has been participating, since December 1998, in the third multiannual programme for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the European Union (1997 to 2000) (1).     See also     (1) Decision       No 2/98      of the Association Council between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Poland, of the other part, of 5 November 1998 adopting the terms and conditions for the participation of Poland in the Community programme in the field of small and medium-sized enterprises.

   Green Paper on Modernising Labour Law     Green Paper on Modernising Labour Law     The aim of this Green Paper is to initiate a public debate in the European Union (EU) on the modernisation of labour law in the light of trends in European labour markets. They must become more flexible and guarantee optimum security. Labour law has an essential role to play in this regard. Promoting debate on this issue would allow the implementation of a suitable, proactive regulatory framework. Managing innovation and change well means that labour markets must take on board three main aspects: flexibility, job security and segmentation.     ACT     Commission Green Paper of 22 November 2006 entitled "Modernising labour law to meet the challenges of the 21st century" [       COM(2006) 708      - not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     In this Green Paper, the Commission identifies the main challenges regarding the gap between the existing legal frameworks and the realities of the labour market.     The aim is to involve the Member States, the social partners and other interested parties in an open debate, in order to look at how labour law can help to promote flexibility in conjunction with security, regardless of the type of employment contract.     The Commission plans to organise a public consultation over a four-month period based on the questions asked in this Green Paper. A follow-up communication at the end of the public consultation will be adopted by the Commission in 2007.     The Commission acts as a catalyst to support the action of the Member States, since protection of working conditions depends mainly on national legislation. At EU level, the social acquis supports and complements the action of the Member States.      Developments in European labour markets      Labour markets in Europe are changing primarily in line with rapid technological progress, more intensive competition in the face of globalisation and the development of consumer demand. This is leading to changes in the organisation of work and working time, pay and the number of workers employed in various stages of the production cycle.     This change has led to a diversification in types of employment contracts, with new categories of workers (such as those hired through temporary agencies) being created. The relationship between the law and collective labour agreements is thus developing in parallel. These collective agreements can be used to adapt the legal principles to the specific economic situations and circumstances of particular sectors.     At Community level, the EU has legislated in order to ensure that the new forms of more flexible working are associated with certain minimum social rights for all workers, in terms of both       part-time work      and       fixed-term work      . On the other hand, no common position has been adopted by the Council on a proposal for a directive on working conditions for       temporary workers hired through agencies      .      Proliferation of atypical forms of contract      These contracts include fixed-term and part-time contracts, on-call contracts, zero-hour contracts, contracts for workers hired through temporary employment agencies, and freelance contracts.     Freelance workers choose to work independently, despite a lower level of social protection, because it offers them more direct control over their conditions of employment and pay. The proportion of total employment represented by workers recruited on atypical contracts has risen from more than 36% in 2001 to almost 40% in EU-25 in 2005. Freelance workers represent 15% of the total workforce. Fixed-term work has risen from 12% of total employment in 1998 to more than 14% of total employment in EU-25 in 2005.     This greater diversity of contracts has certain negative effects. A succession of short-term, low-quality jobs with insufficient social protection can lead some people into a vulnerable position. The Commission would like to point out that the risk of vulnerability on the labour market affects primarily women, older people and young people recruited on the basis of atypical contracts.      Modernisation of labour law: questions for discussion      This Green Paper is intended to promote discussion on various issues associated with the modernisation of labour law, such as:       employment transition        involving the move from one status to another. The chances of entering the labour market, staying there and making progress vary considerably. Employment protection legislation and the rules on contracts at national level both have a significant impact on transitions between employment statuses, in particular as regards the long-term unemployed or those working in insecure jobs;        legal uncertainty        associated mainly with these forms of atypical employment. The phenomenon of disguised employment, when an employee is not considered as such in order to hide his real legal situation and avoid certain social costs, is widespread. The lack of legal clarity regarding the definition of freelance workers, for example, may lead to gaps in the application of the law. The idea of "economically dependent work" covers situations coming under neither the concept of regular employment, nor that of freelance work. There is no employment contract drawn up in such a case. Even if these workers are not in a situation of vulnerability, they remain economically dependent on a single customer, employer or principal for their income and may not fall within the scope of labour legislation;        temporary agency work        is a three-way relationship between a company, a worker and an agency. The complexity of these relationships is compounded when these workers are involved in long subcontracting chains;        working time        , subject to Community harmonisation, is also influenced by developments on the labour markets. The Directive on certain aspects of the         organisation of working time        had still not been adopted by the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) by the end of 2006;        the mobility of workers        in the light of the different definitions of a "worker". The mobility of workers is being jeopardised because the EU leaves it to the Member States to define the term. The Commission takes the view that having to refer constantly to national rather than Community law in this regard could weaken protection for workers;        undeclared work        is a persistent and worrying aspect of today's labour markets. As the main factor in social dumping, it is responsible not only for the exploitation of workers but also for distorting competition. In a         Resolution        adopted in 2003, the Council called on the Member States to resolve this problem by means of preventive measures and penalties, as well as by concluding partnerships between the social partners and the public authorities at national level.

summary of   Directive 2005/89/EC — measures to safeguard security of electricity supply and infrastructure investment   what is the aim of the directive  It aims to safeguard the security of electricity supply to ensure:   the proper functioning of the EU’s internal market for electricity;   an adequate level of interconnection between EU countries;   an adequate level of generation capacity; and   a balance between supply and demand.   key points    Subject matter and scope   EU countries must:   define general, transparent and non-discriminatory policies on security of electricity supply compatible with the requirements of a competitive single market for electricity; and   define and publish the role and responsibilities of competent authorities and different players in the market.   When adopting policy implementation measures, they must take certain elements into account, in particular the need to:   ensure the continuity of electricity supplies;   study the internal market and the possibilities for cross-border cooperation in relation to security of electricity supply;   reduce the long-term effects of the growth in electricity demand;   introduce a degree of diversity in electricity generation in order to ensure a reasonable balance between different primary fuels;   promote energy efficiency and the use of new technologies;   continuously renew transmission and distribution networks to maintain performance.    Operational network security    Transmission system operators  *  must set  minimum rules and obligations  to ensure the continuous operation of the transmission and, where appropriate, the distribution network under foreseeable circumstances. EU countries may require transmission system operators to submit these rules and obligations to the competent authorities for approval. EU countries must ensure that transmission system operators and, where appropriate, distribution system operators  *  , comply with these rules.   System operators must set and meet  quality of supply and network security performance objectives  . Curtailment of supply in emergency situations must be based on  predefined criteria  and the relevant measures taken in consultation with other transmission system operators concerned.    Balancing supply and demand    The directive includes specific measures necessary to maintain the  balance between electricity demand and available generation capacity  , to avoid EU countries taking more interventionist measures which are incompatible with competition.   EU countries need to have a  clear policy  in place to maintain the balance between supply and demand. In particular, they need to:   encourage the establishment of wholesale markets;   require network operators to ensure that an appropriate level of generation reserve capacity is maintained;   facilitate the development of new generation capacity; or   encourage energy conservation and technology for demand management in real time.      Network investment   Investment is crucial for competition and the future security of electricity supply in the EU. EU countries must set in place systems for providing  information  to operators which facilitate investment.   Reports    EU countries or their competent authorities, in cooperation with transmission network operators, must prepare reports on security of supply, as required by Directive 2009/72/EC —  the internal market in electricity  .   These reports must contain information on:   operational network security, projected balance of supply and demand;   prospects for security of supply within the medium term; and   investment intentions of transmission system operators as regards provision of cross-border interconnection capacity.     On the basis of this information, the  European Commission  prepares a report and sends it to the EU countries, the competent authorities and the  Agency for cooperation between EU energy regulators  .   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 24 February 2006 and had to become law in the EU countries by 24 February 2008.   background   For more information, see:    Security of electricity supply  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Transmission system operator:  an organisation which is responsible for the transport of energy at national or regional level using fixed infrastructure.   Distribution system operator:  an organisation responsible for providing and operating low, medium and high voltage networks for regional distribution of electricity as well as for supply of lower-level distribution systems and directly connected customers.
   IMI Joint Undertaking     IMI Joint Undertaking     The European Union (EU) is launching a Joint Technology Initiative (JTI) in the pharmaceuticals sector. In 2008, the European initiative led to the creation of a Joint Undertaking (henceforth referred to as the “IMI Joint Undertaking”) for the period up to 31 December 2017. This undertaking is intended to facilitate private investment, knowledge transfer and the involvement of small and medium-sized enterprises in the field of research into developing safer and more effective innovative medicines.     ACT     Council Regulation (EC) No       73/2008      of 20 December 2007 setting up the Joint Undertaking for the implementation of the Joint Technology Initiative on Innovative Medicines.     SUMMARY     The IMI Joint Undertaking implements the Joint Technology Initiative (JTI) on Innovative Medicines, with a view to the development of a competitive, innovation-based pharmaceuticals sector. This public-private partnership aims to support investments in this field.     The IMI Joint Undertaking is a Community body possessing legal personality. Its headquarters are in Brussels. This undertaking has been set up for a period up to 31 December 2017. Its founding members are the       European Commission      and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations       (EFPIA)      .     Any legal entity directly or indirectly supporting research and development in a Member State or in a country associated with the       7th Framework Programme      (7th FP) may become a member of the IMI Joint Undertaking.      Objectives      The Joint Undertaking aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the medicine development process so that the pharmaceutical sector produces safer and more effective innovative treatments. The objectives of the Joint Undertaking are thus to contribute to the implementation of the 7th FP and to support pharmaceutical research and development in the Member States and countries associated with the 7th FP. The participation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and cooperation with the private sector and the academic world are encouraged.     In addition, the Joint Undertaking aims to ensure complementarity with other activities of the 7th FP and to establish a public-private partnership with a view to increasing research investment and fostering cooperation between the public and private sectors.      Projects and activities      The IMI Joint Undertaking supports prospective research activities, based on projects selected following open and competitive calls for project proposals, independent evaluation and the conclusion of grant agreements and project agreements.     The participating research-based pharmaceutical companies that are members of EFPIA are not eligible to receive financial support from the IMI Joint Undertaking for any activity.      Operation      The       bodies of the IMI Joint Undertaking      are as follows:      the         Governing Board        is composed of representatives of each of the members of the Joint Undertaking. It is responsible for operations and for overseeing the implementation of activities. It meets at least twice a year;       the         Executive Director        represents the IMI Joint Undertaking from a legal point of view. He or she is also the chief executive responsible for the day-to-day management of the Undertaking in accordance with the decisions taken by the Governing Board;       the         Scientific Committee        is the advisory body to the Governing Board, with responsibilities including advising on the scientific priorities for the annual implementation plan proposal.      The IMI Joint Undertaking is supported by two       external advisory bodies      :      the         IMI States Representatives Group        consists of one representative of each Member State and of each country associated with the Framework Programme. It advises on the annual scientific priorities. Furthermore, it also informs the IMI Joint Undertaking on relevant activities ongoing at national level;       the         Stakeholder Forum        is convened at least once a year by the Executive Director. It is informed on the activities of the IMI Joint Undertaking and provides comments.      The       financial resources      of the Joint Undertaking include members' financial contributions, revenue generated by the IMI Joint Undertaking and any other financial contributions, resources and revenues.     The research activities are funded through non-monetary contributions by the research-based pharmaceutical companies that are members of EFPIA, contributions from members and a Community financial contribution under the 7th FP. This financial commitment on the part of the Community is limited to a maximum of EUR 1 000 million.      Context      Under the 7th Community FP, the EU provides for the establishment of long-term public-private partnerships in the form of JTIs. These JTIs result from the work of European Technology Platforms set up under the 6th FP and implemented through Joint Undertakings.     In addition to the IMI, five other JTIs are planned in the sectors of spaceborne computer systems (       ARTEMIS      ), nanotechnologies (       ENIAC      ), aeronautics and air transport       (Clean Sky)      , hydrogen and fuel cells (FUEL CELL) and Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (       GMES      ).

act   Directive  2006/115/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on rental right and lending right and on certain rights related to copyright in the field of intellectual property (codified version).   summary   EU countries must introduce laws granting the right to authorise or prohibit the rental and lending of originals and copies of copyright works.   Rental means making available for use, for a limited period of time and for direct or indirect economic or commercial advantage.   Lending means making available for use, for a limited period of time and not for direct or indirect economic or commercial advantage, when it is made through establishments which are accessible to the public.    Owners of right   The holders of rental and lending rights are the authors, including the principal directors of films, performers, phonogram producers or film producers. The transfer of the rights of performers appearing in films is governed by special rules.   Termination or transfer of right   Where an author or performer has transferred or assigned his rental right concerning a phonogram or an original or copy of a film, he retains the right to be paid an equitable amount for its rental. This right cannot be waived. However, its administration may be delegated to collecting societies representing authors or performing artists.   Derogation to lending right   EU countries may derogate from the exclusive lending right, provided that at least authors obtain payment for such lending. EU countries are free to determine this payment taking account of their cultural promotion objectives.   Neighbouring rights to copyright   As regards rights related to copyright, EU countries must ensure that performers and broadcasting organisations are granted exclusive rights of fixation. EU countries must ensure that performers have the exclusive right of broadcasting and communicating to the public for in respect of their live performances. The broadcasting or communication to the public of a phonogram published for commercial purposes entitles performers and producers to remuneration. Broadcasting organisations have the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit the rebroadcasting of their broadcasts, as well as the communication to the public of their broadcasts if it takes place in public areas and an entrance fee is paid.  EU countries must ensure that performers phonogram producers, producers of the first fixations of films and broadcasting organisations have an exclusive right to make available to the public, by sale or otherwise, fixations of their performances, their phonograms, the original and copies of their films and fixations of their broadcasts. This distribution right is exhausted within the EU where the first sale of these objects is made either by the right holder or with his consent.  EU countries may provide for limitations to related rights in respect of private use, use of short excerpts or certain other uses.  Protection of copyright-related rights under the directive must in no way affect the protection of copyright.

act   Decision  No 555/2014/EU  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on the participation of the Union in a European metrology programme for innovation and research (EMPIR) jointly undertaken by several Member States   summary   EMPIR, which follows up on the European metrology research programme (EMRP), is co-funded by the European Union’s (EU)  Horizon 2020 programme  and the national budgets of the participating countries. The EU participates in this joint programme on the basis of  Article 185  of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (public-public partnership).   Objectives   EMPIR is aimed at supporting the creation of an integrated European metrology research system that is active at the regional, national, European and international levels.  A further goal is to provide appropriate and integrated metrology solutions supporting competitiveness, as well as measurement technologies addressing societal challenges (e.g. health, environment and energy).   Focus   EMPIR includes activities on:        —     innovation and industrial exploitation;            —     research for standards;            —     standardisation and regulatory purposes;            —     capacity building.       Participation and funding   Participation in EMPIR projects takes place in line with Horizon 2020  rules for participation and dissemination  (Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013) and the specific derogations contained in this EMPIR decision.  A  list  of Euramet national metrology institutes (NMIs) and designated institutes (DIs) eligible to participate in EMPIR projects is provided on the  EMPIR participant portal  .   Implementation   Euramet, the European regional metrology organisation, has been designated by the participating countries to implement EMPIR. Euramet organises the calls for proposals, the peer-review evaluation and the selection and monitoring of projects, as well as the allocation of the EU contribution.  EMPIR is implemented on the basis of annual work plans. Financial support mainly takes the form of grants to selected projects.  EURAMET invites interested individuals or organisations from the metrology research community and users to suggest potential research topics before identifying the topics for each call for proposal.   Budget   The EU’s financial contribution to the programme is up to €300 million. This covers the period 2014-2024. This contribution is equivalent to that paid by the participating countries to EMPIR projects, excluding the contributions of the participating countries to administrative costs exceeding 5 % of the EMPIR budget.  The contribution of the participating countries consists of payments made through institutional funding from the NMIs in EU and  European free trade association countries  , as well as from the DIs participating in EMPIR.

   Africa and Europe: strengthening transport cooperation     Africa and Europe: strengthening transport cooperation     This communication supports the idea of connecting the trans-European transport networks with the African transport networks. The Commission encourages the strengthening of cooperation and the exchange of experiences between the European Union (EU) and the African Union (AU) to establish a safer and more effective transport system.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and to the Council of 24 June 2009 – “Partnership between the European Union and Africa – Connecting Africa and Europe: working towards strengthening transport cooperation” [       COM(2009) 301      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The communication promotes reflection upon how cooperation and the exchange of experiences can be improved to encourage the African Union (AU) to establish a safer and more effective transport system, including the extension of trans-European transport networks (TEN-T) towards Africa. The communication is therefore linked to the       Euro-African partnership for infrastructure      adopted in 2007. Within this partnership regional and national transport, water, energy, and telecommunications networks are interconnected throughout Africa.     The proposed measures are to be applied through existing instruments and cooperation between the European Union (EU) and Africa, in particular the       Cotonou agreement      , the       European Development Fund      , and the       European Neighbourhood Policy      .      The need for an EU-African transport cooperation      As the principle means of providing physical access to employment, health care and education, transport is essential to development and to the well-being of both rural and urban communities.       The costs of transport in Africa are some of the highest globally      and are particularly high in landlocked African countries; due in part to weak infrastructures, excessive administrative procedures, lack of appropriate governance and ineffective safety regulations.     An effective transport network is       particularly important for landlocked countries      . African transport networks must be developed when necessary for trade flow passing from ports towards these landlocked countries. By facilitating and improving transport flows between the EU and Africa, transport costs can be lowered whilst the sustainability and reliability of the transports services is improved. To achieve a genuine Euro-African transport network, there needs to be a       coordinated approach      with regards to the       planning and implementation of infrastructure      as well as an enhanced cooperation in the two principle modes of transport: air and maritime transport.      Aviation sector      The measures proposed by the Commission are designed to       increase efficiency and long-term growth within the field of African air transport      .     The AU encourages structured dialogue both between African organisations and between regional economic communities. This dialogue would develop the following areas:      air safety;       security;       modernisation of economic regulations;       environmental limits.       Maritime sector      Cooperation between the EU and the AU is needed to       improve efficiency of African ports      . The Commission proposes three ways for this to happen:      simplify regulatory aspects of customs and documentary procedures;       develop port infrastructure;       apply international standards (the international ship and port facilities security code – ISPS) to ensure port security.      In regard to environmental aspects, the Commission also suggest establishing efficient port installations to easier process waste from vessels in compliance with international conventions.      Development of a safer and more effective transport system      Issues of security and safety affect all modes of transport in both Europe and Africa.     Within       maritime transport      , it is important that countries in north and north-west Africa commit to combat the use by criminal organisations of overloaded small boats to transport illegal immigrants. This practice puts at risk the lives of thousands of people. Another issue is that of piracy, which currently represents an obstacle to the development of trade due to the lack of security in ports and along coastlines. The Commission therefore proposes that the EU:      assists in the administrative implementation of maritime regulations;       strengthens cooperation within its integrated maritime policy with Africa to encourage a heightened maritime surveillance;       promotes a more effective exchange of information with the relevant national authorities.      The Commission suggests that the opening up to       air traffic      from Africa should be accompanied by the reorganisation of air space and the network of air routes to ensure greater economic and environmental efficiency and safety.      Road      is the principle mode of transport in Africa, in particular with regard to access to rural areas. The Commission therefore proposes guidelines in the field of road safety to be developed within national and regional administration:      create appropriate mechanism to promote the exchange of best practice;       encourage the allocation of European funds meant for the road network to specific measures designed to improve road safety;       promote the inclusion of road safety aspects in social impact studies for road investment.      The EU supports European cities in establishing integrated strategies for       urban transport      by means of the       CIVITAS      programme, within which cities are able to exchange ideas and good practice. The Commission proposes that this programme be extended to include African cities so that they can also benefit from these ideas and experiences.

   Reform of the EU State aid rules on Services of General Economic Interest     Reform of the EU State aid rules on Services of General Economic Interest     This communication aims to launch the political debate on the upcoming revision of the State aid package on Services of General Economic Interest (SGEI).     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 23 March 2011 – “Reform of the EU State Aid Rules on Services of General Economic Interest” [       COM(2011) 146      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY      Context      The package on State aid for Services of General Economic Interest (SGEI) is set to be revised. The current package includes a number of measures adopted in 2005, in particular the       SGEI Decision      and the       SGEI Framework      , in which the Commission clarified the application of Articles 106 and 107 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) (on State aid) to compensation for SGEI.     In its communication       “Towards a Single Market Act”      , the Commission undertook to adopt, by 2011, a communication and a series of measures on services of general interest. The Commission has emphasised that the EU and its member countries must ensure that public services are easier to operate at the appropriate level, adhere to clear financing rules, are of the highest quality and are accessible to everyone. EU competition rules only apply to those services of general interest that are “economic” in nature.      Review of the SGEI State aid rules      The overall objective of the proposed reform of the State aid rules for SGEI is to increase the contribution that SGEI can make to the wider EU economic recovery. EU countries need to guarantee certain services at affordable conditions to their citizens, such as hospitals, education, social services, communications and transport.     In accordance with the requirements of the SGEI Decision and the SGEI Framework, the Commission has conducted a wide consultation. This included asking EU countries to report on the application of the current package on SGEI as well as launching a public consultation. Overall the consultation process concluded that the introduction of the current package on SGEI was generally welcomed and that the existing legal instruments have made a positive contribution to the overall objective of legal certainty. The consultation also, however, demonstrated the need for improvement; in particular, the need for clearer, simpler, more proportionate and more effective instruments to ensure an easier application of the rules. To achieve this, the Commission is considering basing the upcoming reform on the two       key principles      of clarification and a diversified and proportionate approach.     To ensure an improved       clarity      , the Commission is considering providing further guidance on core issues in the field of State aid rules for SGEI. Insofar as concepts are defined by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) as interpreted by the Courts, the Commission’s role is limited to providing guidance on how it understands the TFEU and the case law. The Commission considers giving guidance, inter alia, on:      the distinction between economic and non-economic activities under State aid rules and the qualification of certain entities as undertakings;       the limits that State aid rules impose on EU countries when defining an economic activity as an SGEI;       the conditions under which compensation for certain SGEI provided at local level affects trade between EU countries, thereby falling within the scope of State aid rules;       the requirements which public authorities have to follow under State aid rules when they entrust an undertaking with the performance of an SGEI;       the conditions under which compensation for SGEI does not involve State aid because the tender selects the provider at the least cost for the community or because the price charged is in line with that of an efficient and "well-run" undertaking (these two alternatives derive from the European Court of Justice’s         Altmark        judgment);       how to increase convergence between the application of State aid and public procurement rules;       the interplay between the rules of the package and other sector specific SGEI rules.      The current package on SGEI already distinguishes different levels of scrutiny. In a       diversified and proportionate approach      , the Commission is planning to differentiate to an even larger extent between different types of services depending on the extent to which State aid in these economic sectors poses a serious risk of distorting competition. This would involve:       simplification        of the application of the State aid rules for certain types of social services organised by local communities, which are particular in their financing structure and objectives and which only have a minor impact on intra-EU trade;       an increased emphasis on         efficiency        of large-scale commercial services entrusted with public service obligations, by taking into account the efficiency and quality levels of the SGEI provider in the compensation granted.

act   Council Decision  2007/436/EC  , Euratom of 7 June 2007 on the system of the European Communities’ own resources   summary   The operation of the European Union (EU) relies on a balanced budget that is financed entirely by own resources. The own resources ceiling is maintained at 1.23 % of all the Member States’ gross national income (GNI).  There are three categories of own resources: traditional own resources, the own resource based on value added tax (VAT) and the own resource based on gross national income (GNI). Other revenue sources include taxes paid by officials, fines imposed on firms by the Union and interest on late payments.   Traditional own resources   Traditional own resources consist of customs duties and levies on sugar production within the Union. Member States may retain, by way of collection costs, 25 % of the amounts raised.   VAT resource   A uniform rate of 0.30 % is collected on the harmonised VAT base of each Member State. The VAT base is limited to 50 % of each country’s gross national income (GNI). The aim of this rule is to prevent poorer Member States from having to pay a disproportionate amount.   Resource based on GNI   A uniform percentage is taken on the gross national income (GNI) of each EU Member State. This is used to finance the part of the EU budget that is not covered by the other own resources and other revenue sources. The aim is to balance revenue and expenditure.   Corrections in favour of certain Member States   Corrections are based on the principle whereby any Member State sustaining a budgetary burden which is excessive in relation to its relative prosperity is likely to benefit from a correction when the time comes.  The countries currently benefiting from this type of measure are the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, Netherlands and Sweden.   Collection of own resources   The method for collecting own resources is determined by national provisions that are examined regularly by the Commission. The Member States inform the Commission of any anomalies having a financial impact with respect to collection.   Modification to the EU system of own resources   In June 2011, the Commission submitted a draft decision of the Council on the system of resources of the European Union for 2014-20. The decision, which was adopted by the Council in May 2014, will only enter into force when ratified by all Member States. However, once in force, it will apply retroactively with effect from 1 January 2014.

   Hiring of vehicles for the carriage of goods     Hiring of vehicles for the carriage of goods     This Directive allows the use of vehicles hired by undertakings established on the territory of another Member State. Among other requirements, such vehicles must comply with the laws of the Member State of origin and be driven by the personnel of the undertaking using them. The Directive does not affect the Member States' obligations concerning the time-limits for transposition into national law.     ACT     Directive       2006/1/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 January 2006 on the use of vehicles hired without drivers for the carriage of goods by road [Official Journal L 33 of 4.2.2006].     SUMMARY     From a macroeconomic point of view, the use of hired vehicles       *      permits an optimum allocation of resources by limiting the wasteful use of factors of production.     From a microeconomic point of view, this possibility brings an element of flexibility to the organisation of transport and thus increases the productivity of the undertakings concerned.     Each Member State must allow the use within its territory of vehicles       *      hired by undertakings established on the territory of another Member State, provided that:      the vehicle has been registered or put into circulation in compliance with the laws in the latter Member State;       the contract relates solely to the hiring of a vehicle without a driver and is not accompanied by a service contract concluded with the same undertaking covering driving or accompanying personnel;       the hired vehicle is at the sole disposal of the undertaking using it during the period of the hire contract;       the hired vehicle is driven by personnel of the undertaking using it.

   Workers' mobility: facilitating the acquisition and preservation of supplementary pension rights     Workers' mobility: facilitating the acquisition and preservation of supplementary pension rights     This proposal is designed to reduce the obstacles both to freedom of movement between the Member States and to occupational mobility within a Member State by optimising the conditions for acquiring supplementary pension rights and harmonising the rules governing dormant pension rights and the transfer of acquired rights. A further aim of the proposed directive is to improve the information given to workers on how mobility may affect supplementary pension rights.     PROPOSAL     Implementing the Community Lisbon Programme: proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on improving the portability of supplementary pension rights.     SUMMARY     This proposal for a directive provides for four main measures to protect the supplementary pension rights       *      of workers moving within the European Union (EU).     In the event of adoption, this directive will not apply to:      supplementary pension schemes which, as at the date of entry into force of the Directive, will no longer be open to new members;       supplementary pension schemes that are subject to measures intended to preserve or restore their financial situation;       insolvency protection systems, compensation arrangement schemes or national reserve funds.       Conditions governing acquisition      The Member States are to take the necessary steps to ensure that:      where active scheme membership is made conditional upon a period of employment, this period shall not exceed one year;       where a minimum age is stipulated for the accrual by an active scheme member of acquired rights, this age shall not exceed 21 years;       where an acquisition period is applied, this shall under no circumstances exceed one year for active scheme members over the age of 25, or five years for active scheme members below that age;       where an outgoing worker has not yet acquired pension rights when the employment relationship is terminated, the supplementary pension scheme         *        shall reimburse the contributions paid by the outgoing worker, or paid on the worker's behalf in accordance with national law or collective agreements or contracts.       Preservation of dormant pension rights      The Member States are to take measures to:      guarantee that pension rights acquired by outgoing workers may be preserved in the supplementary scheme where they acquired them;       ensure that dormant pension rights         *        or their values are treated in line with the value of the rights of active scheme members.       Information      This proposal supplements Directive       2003/41/EC      on the activities and       supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision as regards information      . The aim is to ensure that every potentially outgoing worker, whether or not a member of a scheme, will receive the necessary information on how terminating an employment relationship could affect supplementary pension rights.     Active scheme members who so request may receive information concerning:      the conditions for acquiring supplementary pension rights;       the consequences of the application of these conditions when the employment relationship is terminated;       the value of their acquired rights or an evaluation of their acquired pension rights going back a maximum of 12 months from the date of the request;       the conditions concerning the future treatment of dormant pension rights.      Deferred beneficiaries who so request may receive information concerning:      the value of their dormant rights         *        or an evaluation going back no further than 12 months from the request;       the conditions concerning the future treatment of dormant pension rights.       Minimum requirements      This proposal provides for the principle of non-regression.     Accordingly, the Member States may adopt or retain more favourable provisions than those laid down in the proposal.     The implementation of the directive may in no case lead to a diminishing of rights concerning the acquisition and preservation of supplementary pensions.      Implementation      The Member States must adopt the necessary laws, regulations and administrative provisions, or ensure that they are put in place by the social partners, within two years after adoption of this Directive at the latest.     Given the diversity of supplementary pension schemes, the Member States may be granted an extended period of five years (beyond the initial two-year transposition deadline) for transposing certain provisions which might be too restrictive in the short term.      Report      With effect from the year following the two-year deadline for adoption of this directive, the Commission shall draw up, every five years, a report based on the information sent by the Member States.      Background      The revised Lisbon Strategy and the Social Agenda (2006-2010) underline the importance of mobility for improving the adaptability of workers and businesses and increasing labour-market flexibility. Faced with the problem of an ageing population, the Member States are placing greater emphasis on supplementary pension schemes to cover the risks of old age. It is thus becoming particularly important to reduce the obstacles to mobility which stem from these schemes.     A first step in this direction was taken in 1998 with the adoption of a       directive      on safeguarding supplementary pension rights, aimed mainly at guaranteeing the right to equal treatment for people moving from one country to another.     The present proposal for a directive is designed to supplement the 1998 text. It has been preceded by two rounds of consultation of the social partners, with the Pensions Forum being closely involved.       Key terms used in the act         Supplementary pension: pension provided for by the rules of a supplementary pension scheme established in conformity with national legislation and practice.         Supplementary pension scheme: any occupational retirement pension scheme established in conformity with national legislation and practice, which is linked to an employment relationship and is intended to provide a supplementary pension for employed or self-employed persons.         Dormant pension rights: acquired pension rights which are retained under the scheme in which they have been accrued by a deferred beneficiary.         Value of dormant rights: capital value of the pension rights calculated in accordance with national law and practice.

summary of   Regulation (EU) No 995/2010 on the obligations of operators who place timber and timber products on the market   what is the aim of the regulation  It prohibits illegally harvested timber from being placed on the EU market, and sets out preconditions for the marketing of timber and timber products in the EU.   key points    The regulation requires ‘operators’ who place timber products on the EU market for the first time to exercise ‘due diligence’  *  to ensure they supply products made of legally harvested timber. To this end, operators must use a due diligence system.   Operators may set up their own due diligence systems or use one created by a monitoring organisation.   Monitoring organisations are recognised as such by the European Commission. Their role is to assist operators comply with the requirements of the regulation.   To facilitate the traceability of timber products, all traders who buy and sell timber on the market must keep records of their suppliers and customers.   The regulation, which applies both to EU-harvested and imported timber, covers a wide range of timber products that are listed in the annex and are in accordance with the  Union Customs Code  .   The regulation considers timber/timber products to be legally harvested if they have a  Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade  (FLEGT) licence (established with Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005), or a  CITES  permit (Regulation (EC) No 338/97).    Monitoring of implementation and access to information   At the latest by 30 April of each year, countries covered by the regulation must make available to the public and the  European Commission  information on the application of this regulation during the previous calendar year. The Commission will also make available to the public a EU-wide overview on the basis of the data submitted by all EU countries.  By 3 December 2021 and every 5 years thereafter, the Commission must review the functioning and effectiveness of this regulation on the basis of the information received each year and the experience with its application.   background   Illegal logging  *  is a pervasive environmental, economic and social problem that contributes to climate change, the loss of biodiversity, lost revenue, conflicts (sometimes armed) over land and resources, and corruption.  For more information, see:    Illegal logging  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Due diligence:  a  risk management exercise  to minimise the risk of illegally harvested timber (or products containing it) being offered for sale on the EU market.   Illegal logging:  the harvesting of timber in violation of the laws of the country of harvest.
summary of   Directive 2005/35/EC on ship-source pollution and on the introduction of penalties for infringements   summary    what does this directive do   It creates rules that are applicable EU-wide on the imposition of penalties in the event of discharges of oil or other polluting substances from ships sailing in its waters.   key points    The current legislation states that ship-source polluting discharges constitute  in principle a criminal offence  . According to the directive, this relates to discharges of oil or other polluting substances from vessels. Minor discharges are not automatically considered as offences, except where repeated discharges lead to a deterioration in water quality.   The  persons responsible  for discharging polluting substances may be subject to criminal penalties, if they have acted with intent, recklessly* or with serious negligence. The act of inciting or aiding and abetting a person to discharge a polluting substance may also lead to criminal penalties.   The directive applies to all types of vessels, irrespective of their flag.    Polluting discharges  are forbidden in:   the internal waters, including ports, of an EU country;   the territorial waters of an EU country;   straits used for international navigation subject to the right of transit passage, as laid down in the  1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  ;   the exclusive economic zone (EEZ)* of an EU country;   the high seas.      Exceptions    This regime does not apply to discharges from warships or other ships owned or operated by a state and used only on government non-commercial service.   Exceptions to the ban on discharges of polluting substances may be applied where human safety or that of the ship is in danger.    Legal persons   Directive  2009/123/EC  amended Directive 2005/35/EC to improve rules on ship-source pollution and to ensure that those responsible for discharges of polluting substances are subject to adequate penalties. It requires EU countries to introduce rules on the liability of legal persons under private law* such as companies.   Companies may be subject to criminal penalties if an individual in a leading position within the company has committed a criminal offence for their benefit, whether this person has acted either individually or as part of the company.   The company is also responsible for offences committed by an individual through oversight, specifically through a lack of supervision or control.   The liability of the company must not exclude criminal proceedings against the individuals involved.    Applying penalties   Directive 2009/123/EC also requires EU countries’ national authorities to ensure that effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties are applied, including for minor cases. They must cooperate when a vessel is found guilty of illegal discharging in their area of responsibility before the vessels calls at the port of another EU country.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 1 October 2005. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 1 April 2007.   background   The sinking of the Prestige in November 2002 and of the Erika in December 1999 highlighted the need to tighten the net in relation to ship-source pollution. However, accidents are not the main source of pollution: most of it is the result of deliberate discharges (tank-cleaning operations and waste oil disposal).  These rules incorporate into EU law parts of the  1973 International Convention on the Prevention of Pollution from Ships  and its 1978 Protocol (known as the Marpol Convention). This makes it possible to harmonise application of the rules of this convention.   key terms    * Reckless action  : action taken with the knowledge that it is likely to result in damage.   * Exclusive economic zone (EEZ)  : it is generally understood to arise when a country assumes jurisdiction over the exploration and exploitation of marine resources off its coast. This section is normally considered to be a band extending 200 miles from the shore.   * Legal persons under private law  : all legal entities, such as companies, with the exception of states, public bodies and international public organisations.   acts   Directive  2005/35/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on ship-source pollution and on the introduction of penalties for infringements (OJ L 255, 30.9.2005, pp. 11–21).  Successive amendments to Directive 2005/35/CE have been incorporated in the basic text. This  consolidated version  is of documentary value only.
summary of   Regulation (EU) 2019/2023 laying down ecodesign requirements for household washing machines and household washer-dryers    Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/2014 on energy labelling of household washing machines and household washer-dryers   what is the aim of the regulations  Household washing machines and washer dryers are subject to new and revised  ecodesign   *  requirements and  energy labelling   *  rules. Ecodesign and energy labelling go hand-in-hand providing European consumers with valuable information to enable them to make an informed choice and eventually increase the market for more energy efficient products.  Regulation (EU) 2019/2023 sets out ecodesign requirements, pursuant to Directive 2009/125/EC, for the sale or putting into service of electric mains-operated household  washing machines and washer dryers  . It amends Regulation (EC) No  1275/2008  and repeals Regulation (EU) No  1015/2010  as of 1 March 2021.  Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/2014 sets out rules on the labelling of, and supply of additional product information on, the same appliances. It supplements Regulation (EU)  2017/1369  and repeals Delegated Regulation (EU) No  1061/2010  and Commission Directive  96/60/EC  .   key points    Regulation (EU) 2019/2023    Does not apply to household washing machines with a capacity of less than 2 kg and household washer-dryers with a capacity of 2 kg or less.   Sets out  the ecodesign requirements  in Annex II, which cover:   programme requirements, including rules on providing an ‘eco 40-60’ programme and (for washer-dryers) a wash & dry cycle. The eco 40-60 programme must be set as the default programme where possible, or made available for direct selection without the need for any other selection such as a specific temperature or load. The indications ‘normal’, ‘daily’, ‘regular’ and ‘standard’ must not be used in programme names either alone or in combination with other information;   wash and dry cycle;   energy efficiency;   functional requirements (washing efficiency and rinsing effectiveness);   requirements on duration;   water consumption;   low power modes (off mode and stand-by mode);   resource efficiency, including availability of spare parts, access to repair and maintenance information, material recovery and recycling;   information for installers and end-users.     Sets out the  conformity assessment  procedure: national authorities must apply the verification procedures laid down in Annex IV when carrying out market surveillance checks, and the measurement methods and calculations that must be followed, in Annex III.   Sets out in Annex V indicative  benchmarks  based on the best-performing products and technologies available for such appliances in terms of their water and energy consumption, washing efficiency and airborne acoustical noise emissions.   The  European Commission  must review the regulation in the light of technological progress and assess a number of aspects, such as requirements for reducing microplastics,  6 years  after its entry into force.    Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/2014   Sets out the  energy efficiency class, the spin-drying efficiency class and the acoustic airborne noise emission class  which are based on an index in Annex II.  This  delegated act  sets out obligations on  suppliers  , including to ensure that:   each household washing machine and household washer-dryer is supplied with a printed label in the format as set out in Annex III and, for a multi-drum household washing machine or a multi-drum household washer-dryer, in accordance with Annex X;   the parameters of the product information sheet (Annex V) and of the technical documentation (Annex VI) are entered into the product database;   an electronic label in the format and containing the information as set out in Annex III is made available to dealers for each model of household washing machine and of household washer-dryer.   Sets out obligations on  dealers  , including to ensure that:   each appliance on sale bears a clearly visible label provided by suppliers in line with Annex III;   in the event of distance selling, the label and product information sheet comply with Annexes VII and VIII.    Internet hosting platforms  must ensure that the electronic label and electronic product information sheet provided by the dealer are clearly displayed, according to Annex VIII, on all such appliances sold directly through the site.   National authorities  apply the verification procedure laid down in Annex IX when carrying out market surveillance checks.  The Commission must review these regulations in the light of technological progress 6 years after the entry into force including the possibility of addressing circular economy objectives.   From when do the regulations apply?   They both apply from 1 March 2021.   background   Directive  2009/125/EC  establishes a framework to set  ecodesign requirements for energy-related products  . It tasks the Commission to set these for products which are widely sold and traded in the EU and have a significant environmental impact.  Regulation (EU)  2017/1369  establishes a framework to set  energy labelling requirements  for energy-related products to enable consumers to choose more efficient products to reduce their energy consumption.  The  WEEE Directive  set requirements on e.g. recovery and recycling of  waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE)  to reduce the negative environmental effects resulting from the generation and management of WEEE and from resource use.

   Keep Europe moving - Sustainable mobility for our continent. Mid-term review of the 2001 White Paper     Keep Europe moving - Sustainable mobility for our continent. Mid-term review of the 2001 White Paper     This Communication draws up a mid-term review of European transport strategy, set out in the 2001 White Paper. The Commission reaffirms the main principles that guide its policy. It draws attention to the changes in the context since 2001 and the need to find new solutions to problems encountered within this new framework. Enlargement, the acceleration of globalisation, international commitments on global warming, the geopolitical context of the growth in oil prices and security fears have influenced the sector and resulted in calls for new solutions     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 22 June 2006 on the mid-term review of the Transport White Paper, "Keep Europe moving - Sustainable mobility for our continent, published in 2001. Mid-term review of the Transport White Paper, published in 2001 by the European Commission" [       COM(2006) 314      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The 2001       White Paper      proposed almost 60 measures designed to implement a transport system capable of restoring the balance between different modes, revitalising the railways, promoting sea and waterway transport and controlling the increase in air transport. The White Paper was providing a response to the sustainable development strategy adopted by the Göteborg European Council in June 2001.     This communication reaffirms the principles of 2001, which guide European transport policy by responding to the economic, social and environmental needs of society. This sector provides 7% of GDP in the EU and 5% of jobs. The mobility of goods and citizens, apart from being a right, also creates cohesion and is an essential element of the competitiveness of European industry and services.      Transport policy objectives      This communication provides an opportunity for an overview of the different sectors, in order to identify new solutions in a changing context.     Transport policy is at the heart of the Lisbon agenda for growth and jobs. The policy therefore has long term objectives which seek to balance economic growth, social welfare and environmental protection in all policy choices. It is therefore necessary to:       divorce mobility from its side effects        , which are congestion, accidents and pollution;        optimise the potential        of each mode of transport. Some modes, including waterborne transport, do not reach their full capacity;        promote green propulsion and encourage the use of more environmentally friendly        , energy efficient and safer transport;        promote co-modality        , i.e. the efficient use of different modes of transport on their own and in combinations, resulting in an optimal use of resources.      The Commission also wishes to adapt rail and waterborne transport in line with the principles of the internal market. Efficiency gains supported by EU policies should therefore make these modes of transport more competitive, particularly with regard to road transport.     In order to succeed in meeting these objectives, this communication identifies       four pillars      for transport policy, namely:      the mobility of people and businesses throughout the Union;       environmental protection, the security of energy supply, promoting minimum labour standards and protecting passengers and citizens;       innovation, which supports the implementation of the two previous objectives by making sector activity more efficient and sustainable;       action on the world stage so that other countries can share in these objectives.       The changing context      The text does, however, emphasise that the political context of transport in the EU has changed:       enlargement has given the EU a continental dimension        . Europe is more diverse and each Member State finds itself in different and sometimes even contrasting situations, which include congestion in the West and accessibility problems in the East. This diversity requires differentiated solutions;        the transport industry has changed        . Consolidation is taking place at the European level, especially in the aviation and maritime sectors. In addition, globalisation has led to the creation of large logistics companies with worldwide operations. European transport policy must take this new situation into account;        transport is fast becoming a high-technology industry        . Research and innovation have a fundamental role to play. Some of the most pressing and promising areas include: intelligent transport systems involving communication, navigation and automation, engine technology with increased fuel efficiency and the promotion of alternative fuels;        international environmental commitments        , including those under the Kyoto Protocol, must be integrated into transport policy;        transport policy must continue to attain the objectives of the European energy policy        : transport accounts for 30% of total energy consumption in the EU, with oil dependency reaching 98%. High oil prices influence the sector and promote improved energy efficiency;        the international context has changed        . The threat of terrorism has impacted on the transport sector. At the same time, economic globalisation has affected trade flows and increased demand, particularly in emerging economies;        European governance is evolving        . The basic legal framework of the internal market has largely been established, and much now rests on its effective implementation in the field. The Commission is also seeking to simplify the rules.       A new challenge      Therefore, while the most pressing challenges identified in 2001 were the imbalance between different modes of transport and congestion, the situation has developed subsequently. Road congestion has escalated and is now costing the EU 1% of GDP. There has also been a sustained increase in air traffic and its impact on the environment. Greenhouse gases and global warming are now prominent issues. Overall, domestic transport accounts for 21% of greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions have risen by around 23% since 1990, threatening the achievement of Kyoto targets.     The measures envisaged by the Commission in 2001 will therefore be inadequate for achieving the objectives established at the outset, hence the need for a broader, more flexible instrument for action. In order to devise and evaluate future policies, the Commission wants to promote a debate on transport scenarios with a 20 to 40-year timescale, in order to develop a universal approach to sustainable transport.     FIRST PILLAR: MOBILITY      Road transport      Although international road transport has been liberalised, at national level it is still largely protected. The Commission wishes to establish common rules relating to professional qualifications and working conditions, which vary greatly by Member State. Moreover, the impact on competition regarding differences in fuel-tax levels between Member States are important factors that will influence future development. Therefore, the Commission wishes to narrow the excessive differences in fuel-tax levels.      Rail transport      After the liberalisation of freight transport, whose legal framework is due for completion in 2007, the third package has to open up international passenger transport. The Commission wishes to:      propose measures on access to the market and the profession;       address the issue of excessive differences in excise duty levels;       implement the acquis with the support of regulatory bodies in Member States;       step up efforts to remove technical and operational barriers to international traffic;       establish a network dedicated to rail freight within the political framework of         transport logistics        ;       organise rail-market monitoring using a scoreboard mechanism.       Air transport      The restructuring and integration of the air industry's internal market are at a very advanced stage and customers benefit from the internal market's development. The Commission nonetheless wishes to:      enlarge the internal market and extend its positive contributions to external aviation relations;       complete the creation of the single European sky in order to increase the efficiency of EU air transport;       invest to increase airport capacity, whilst clarifying regulations relating to charges;       reduce environmental effects caused by the rapid rise in traffic.       Maritime transport      The Commission identifies the maritime sector as an alternative to overland transport, particularly because it has considerable potential over short distances, as illustrated by the concept of "       motorways of the sea      ". The development of maritime transport should, however, face up to two key challenges:       the creation of an internal shipping space        . Due to international regulations, sea journeys from one Member State to another are considered as external. Therefore, the Commission wishes to organise a consultation to draw up a strategy for the creation of a "common European maritime space";        the expansion of port capacity        . In order to deal with the estimated growth in maritime transport, investment in ports should increased, in order to improve and extend services, with the help of competition and the introduction of clear rules for public sector contributions.       Transport by waterway      The Commission emphasises river transport's potential, which could be enhanced through its integration into co-modal logistics chains. The       NAIADES      programme sets out an action plan that promotes the sector, which the Commission wishes to implement.     SECOND PILLAR: PROTECTION      Employment and working conditions      Transport is a major employer, providing more than 10 million jobs in the Union. However, in some sectors, such as rail and road transport, shortages of qualified personnel have come to light. The Commission therefore wishes to focus on training and encouraging more young people to choose jobs in the transport profession.     The Commission proposes to examine rules on working conditions due to significant variations in labour costs. The Commission also wishes to establish talks with a view to applying the International Labour Organization Convention in the maritime sector.     The Commission divides the concept of protection into the following categories:       passenger rights        : The Commission notes that passenger rights have been consolidated in recent years, but considers that national authorities have to improve their follow-up of complaints. It therefore hopes to examine ways of promoting an improved quality of service and the assurance of basic passenger rights in all modes of transport, particularly for passengers with reduced mobility;        safety        : the Commission also emphasises the progress that has been made in this area, especially with the creation of a blacklist of dangerous airlines. The Commission wishes to finalise safety rules with the third maritime legislative package as well as road rules with the CARS 21 initiative and         eSafety        forum;        security        : the Commission wishes to refine the acquis of measures established in the wake of 11 September 2001 attacks, which revealed that transport is both a target and an instrument of terrorism. It will, therefore, propose amendments and broaden the scope of safety rules to include land and intermodal transport as well as critical infrastructures;        urban transport        is confronted with a specific problem; city dwellers suffer the consequences of their own mobility more than anyone else. The Commission announces the publication of a Green Paper on this issue.      THIRD PILLAR: INNOVATION     The Commission wishes to assimilate innovation across the board in transport policy in order to hasten the development of relevant solutions. Intelligent safety features, new means of communication and traffic management could all aid the mobility and integration of European networks. EU companies could also win new markets owing to their excellence in the field of transport technologies.      Energy      The transport sector uses a great deal of energy, accounting for 71% of EU oil consumption: 60% by road transport and approximately 9% by air transport. The remaining 2% is used by rail and inland navigation. Rail transport uses 75% electricity and 25% fossil fuels. The text recommends the promotion of improved energy efficiency on a European scale as well as supporting research, demonstration and market introduction of promising new technology.      Infrastructure      Some areas in the "mid-West" of the EU are affected by congestion and pollution. By 2020, 60 big airports are expected to be over congested and a similar trend is observed in ports. It will therefore be necessary to build new infrastructures or to improve existing ones. The implementation of co-modal logistics chains is another solution.      Mobilising sources of financing      The total cost of the 30 priority trans-European transport network (TEN-T) projects, recorded in 2004, is estimated at around 250 billion. However, the public financing capacities of the Member States remain constrained. Similarly, the financial perspective for the period 2007-13 provide only a limited increase in the budget available for the TENs. The EU should therefore focus its co-financing on the critical border-crossing sections and the main bottlenecks. New types of financial engineering should also be developed.      Intelligent mobility      It is becoming increasingly common to charge for the use of transport infrastructure, as demonstrated in London or on specific motorways. The EU has adopted a Directive establishing a framework for toll motorways. These tariff systems aim to finance infrastructure, whilst helping to optimise traffic. The Commission has to propose, no later than 2008, a universal, transparent and comprehensible model for the assessment of all external costs, which must serve as the basis for calculations of infrastructure charges. The Commission also calls for a process of reflection, which encompasses the other modes of transport, in order to identify how intelligent charging can help improve the functioning of the sector.     Logistics is another issue that the Commission wishes to focus on, by drawing up a strategic framework, followed by a consultation leading to an action plan.     Furthermore, the Commission states that all modes of transport must have sophisticated means of communication, navigation and automation, relying in particular on the       Galileo      system. In this respect, the       Intelligent Car      and       SESAR      programmes are used for air transport, ERTMS for the rail industry and       RIS      for waterborne transport. In addition, the Commission wishes to develop similar initiatives in the maritime sector (e-maritime programme).     FOURTH PILLAR: RELATIONS WITH THIRD COUNTRIES     The Commission would like its policy to be part of a broader relationship with non-member countries, as the transport sector is inherently connected to international issues. Furthermore, the convergence of EU and international standards opens export markets for European technology. EU transport companies are often hampered by the maintenance of import or investment barriers in non-member countries. The Commission therefore envisages developing cooperation policies and industrial dialogue with its main trading partners and regional groupings, in particular by concluding agreements. It also wishes to draw up a strategic framework for extending the main axes of the internal transport market and creating a network with neighbouring countries that so desire.

   Safe active implantable medical devices     Safe active implantable medical devices     SUMMARY OF:      Directive 90/385/EEC on the approximation of the laws relating to active implantable medical devices      WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?      As part of the         European Union        (EU) regulatory framework on medical devices         *        , it seeks to harmonise national legislation on active implantable medical devices         *        . This ensures universally high safety standards for patients, giving the public confidence in the system. It enables the products to be placed on the market in any EU country.      KEY POINTS      The devices must be designed and manufactured in a way that poses no risk to patients, medical personnel or others in contact with them.       Every device must bear standard information, where possible by using generally recognised symbols, on its sterile pack and sales packaging.       Devices meeting all the requirements bear the         CE marking        and may be placed on the market throughout the EU.       National authorities must take off the market any defective devices which it is found could harm patients, users or others.       The legislation does not apply to medicines for human use, human blood or transplants, or tissues or cells of human or animal origin.       In 2013, the Commission adopted an implementing act, Implementing Regulation (EU) No         920/2013        on         designating and supervising notified bodies        under Directive 90/385/EEC and Council Directive         93/42/EEC        on medical devices (see         summary        ). This regulation was subsequently amended by Regulation (EU)         2020/666        following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, in spring 2020.       Regulation (EU)         2017/745        (see         summary        ) originally partly repealed Directive 90/385/EEC from 26 May 2020. However, following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to take the pressure off national authorities, notified bodies, manufacturers and other actors to allow them to focus fully on urgent priorities related to the coronavirus crisis, amending Regulation (EU)         2020/561        postponed the date of application for most rules under the medical devices regulation by 1 year — until 26 May 2021.      FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?     It has applied since 3 July 1990 and had to become law in the EU countries by 1 July 1991. It will be repealed as from 26 May 2021.     BACKGROUND     For more information, see:       Medical devices — Sector — Overview        (         European Commission        )        Medical devices — Sector — Current directives        (         European Commission        ).

   Strengthening the European disaster response capacity     Strengthening the European disaster response capacity     The European Union (EU) is to adopt a new strategy for the management of natural or man-made disasters. The strategy will enable the EU to improve the coordination of its response and the use of existing instruments.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council of 26 October 2010 - Towards a stronger European disaster response: the role of civil protection and humanitarian assistance (Text with EEA relevance) [       COM(2010) 600      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The Commission presents a series of proposals to strengthen the European Union’s       response capacity      in the event of natural or man-made disasters. The EU delivers its assistance to the victims of disasters occurring both in EU member countries and throughout the world.     The new strategy therefore aims to facilitate the mobilisation of skills and resources in the area of       civil protection      and       humanitarian assistance      .     These proposals are based on two new provisions of the Lisbon Treaty: Article 196 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) which enables the EU to improve European disaster coordination and Article 122 of the TFEU which provides for the establishment of a solidarity fund.      Coherence of the response      The new strategy is based on the bringing together of humanitarian assistance and civil protection services. In this context, a new       European Emergency Response Centre      is to be set up within the Commission’s       Directorate General ECHO      . It is to operate in liaison with the civil protection and humanitarian assistance authorities in EU countries, and in coordination with the       European External Action Service      (EEAS) and EU Delegations in the event of responses in third countries.     The Commission also supports improved       coordination with the United Nations      (UN), in particular through information exchange. The quality of this information exchange is to be ensured by establishing several levels of focal points down to local level, online communication tools such as the       CECIS system      and the provision of real-time information.      Efficiency of the response      The strategy aims to improve the efficiency of the response by:       planning        and advance mapping of resources and capacities in order to ensure immediate deployment;        pre-positioning of relief assets        , through the establishment of an international logistics network maximising the use of local resources;        needs assessment        , in the disaster relief phase and then in preparing for the rehabilitation operations;       the         efficiency        and         cost-effectiveness of logistics operations        , through coordination units at European level;       the         coordination of transport        , by using the private and military sectors and international organisations but also by increasing the options for European co-financing;       the         use of military assets        , in particular by coordinating responses within the Commission.      The Commission also proposes to increase the       visibility of the EU’s response      by means of a new communication strategy.

summary of   Directive 2014/17/EU –rules on home loans   what is the aim of the directive  Known as ‘the Mortgage Credit Directive’, it aims to ensure that all consumers who take out a mortgage to purchase a property are adequately informed and protected against the risks.   key points    The directive applies to all loans made to consumers for the purpose of buying a home, including loans that are guaranteed by a mortgage or by another comparable security.   It provides for better information to consumers on available mortgage products including:   an obligation on lenders to provide consumers with a standardised information sheet (  European Standardised Information Sheet  - ESIS) which allows them to shop around to identify the right product for them;   inclusion in the ESIS of worst-case scenarios regarding variable interest and foreign currency loans so as to alert consumers of potential interest rate variations;   a guaranteed period of reflection or a right of withdrawal for borrowers prior to being bound by the credit agreement;   new EU-wide standards to assess the credit worthiness of mortgage applicants so as to ensure that borrowers can meet their repayment obligations.     The directive establishes business conduct principles.   These ensure that lenders and credit intermediaries (i.e. persons or companies providing information and assistance to consumers looking for a mortgage loan) act honestly and transparently in the consumer’s interests.   Lenders and intermediaries must ensure that their staff have up-to-date knowledge on loan agreements and that customers are provided with all the necessary information before signing any agreement.     Consumers have a general right to repay their loans early, thus benefiting from a reduction in the total remaining cost of the mortgage. In such cases, EU countries may entitle lenders to fair compensation for any costs directly and exclusively linked to early repayment.   The directive establishes an EU passport regime for credit intermediaries. This means that in principle once authorised in one EU country, a credit intermediary is allowed to provide services throughout the EU.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 20 March 2014. EU countries had to incorporate it in national law by 21 March 2016.   background   For more information, see:    Mortgage credit  (  European Commission  ).
   Reducing administrative costs     Reducing administrative costs     The European Commission has set itself the objective of alleviating the bureaucratic constraints with which the business sector is faced. In order to achieve this, it proposes reducing administrative costs by 25% within five years. A reduction of this kind should create a 1.5% increase in GDP, i.e. almost EUR 150 billion.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions "Action programme for reducing administrative burdens in the European Union" [       COM(2007) 23      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     In order to achieve the objectives of the       revised Lisbon Strategy      and the "Better lawmaking" programme, the Commission realised that the administrative costs       *      borne by the business sector needed to be reduced. Companies need to devote a lot of time to meeting certain requirements to provide information, rather than spending this time on their main activities.     The administrative costs stem from the obligations to provide information which are set out in the legislation. The programme to reduce administrative costs is based on these obligations to provide information. In fact, it is easier to compare obligations to provide information than entire pieces of legislation. The measures to reduce administrative costs are limited to simplifying the requirements to provide information and do not change the fundamental principles of the basic legislation.     The administrative costs result from international law, Community law, national law or regional law. International law and a certain proportion of Community law need to be transposed into national law. It is therefore a shared responsibility which will call for sustained partnership between the EU institutions and the Member States.      Measuring administrative costs at EU level      The present action programme uses an EU administrative cost model. This model is based on the SCM method (Standard Cost Method) and includes a number of variants. The SCM was developed by the Netherlands. It seeks to identify information requirements contained in the regulations which require companies to make certain pieces of information available to the public authorities or third parties. It also involves evaluating the internal and external resources used by companies to produce the information required.     The SCM method is applied by a network of 17 Member States. However, the Commission felt that it was necessary to develop a true European administrative cost model (EU SCM). The EU SCM is based on the SCM but differs from it with regard to the range of groups to which information requirements apply. This group is bigger and includes companies, the voluntary sector, the public authorities and members of the public. The main innovation of the EU SCM model is therefore the fact that it evaluates overregulation       *      .     The aim of the action programme is to measure the administrative costs imposed by Community legislation by November 2008 at the latest. The measuring of administrative costs at EU level must meet three objectives:      accurately identify all the information obligations which are derived from legislative acts. The programme for reducing administrative costs is based on the information requirements and not on the legislative texts as a whole. The information requirements must be classified clearly at Community and national levels;       harmonise the information requirements which need to be measured. A minimum level of harmonisation is necessary in order to compare the data from the Member States and establish joint reduction targets. Several parameters should be harmonised, including the following: the classifications by origin of information requirements, the standardised cost ratios, the type of administrative activities concerned and the populations affected, the definition of an "efficient business" and the entities concerned. For practical reasons, harmonisation should focus initially only on the measures aimed at companies;       select the information requirements which need to be measured. For practical reasons, the Commission proposes measuring only Community regulations and directives and the provisions adopted in order to transpose them into national law. The Commission also proposes that only those information requirements in the following priority areas be measured: company law, pharmaceutical legislation, working environment/employment relations, tax law (VAT), statistics, agriculture and agricultural subsidises, food safety, transport, fisheries, financial services, environment, cohesion policy and public procurement. The Commission plans to deal as a matter of priority with those areas in which administrative costs are the highest.       Establishing a Community strategy to reduce administrative burdens      The Commission proposes first of all that the overall objective should be to reduce administrative costs by 25% throughout the EU. This objective should be achieved within five years.     In order to pursue this objective, the Commission plans to reduce certain charges in areas in which action can be taken immediately. A few minor changes to the existing legislation would make it possible to achieve significant results quickly and easily. The Commission has identified 11 sectors in which administrative burdens could be reduced by EUR 1.3 billion.     The Member States should also take decisions which would allow them to reduce costs since a significant proportion of these costs stems directly from national and regional legislation.     In order to meet these objectives, the Commission proposes drawing up the following common principles in order to reduce administrative burdens:      reduce the frequency of reporting requirements to the minimum levels necessary;       review whether the same information requirement is not requested several times;       encourage web-based reporting;       limit the constraints imposed on small and medium-sized enterprises by introducing thresholds for information requirements;       target those operators which are most likely to incur administrative costs in certain sectors;       reduce or eliminate information requirements where these relate to legislative requirements which have since been dropped or modified;       provide clarification of complex pieces of legislation which may slow down business activities.       Organisation      The Commission specifies the organisational structure of the programme. It will, for example, call in external consultants to measure the administrative costs associated with Community legislation. It will work closely with the Member States in order to implement the programme.      Next steps      The Commission calls on the Member States to complete their measurement exercise by 2009 and to set targets for reducing administrative burdens at national level by October 2008 at the latest.     It proposes to the European Parliament and the Council that they adopt measures on priority areas as soon as possible.     Lastly, it will report regularly on the progress achieved in implementing the programme.       Key terms used in the act         Administrative costs: costs incurred by enterprises, the voluntary sector, public authorities and citizens in meeting legal obligations to provide information on their action (or production), either to public authorities or to private parties.         Overregulation: overregulation occurs when an authority transposes a piece of legislation by creating or expanding the requirements for which provision was originally made.

   Agreements with the countries of the Western Balkans on the facilitation of the issuance of visas     Agreements with the countries of the Western Balkans on the facilitation of the issuance of visas     The agreements concluded between the European Union (EU) and the countries of the Western Balkans on facilitating the issuance of visas are intended to simplify and speed up the procedures for issuing visas to nationals of these Western Balkan countries. These agreements are, in principle, coupled with readmission agreements.     ACT      Council Decision         2007/821/EC        of 8 November 2007 on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Albania on the facilitation of the issuance of visas.       Council Decision         2007/822/EC        of 8 November 2007 on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and Bosnia and Herzegovina on the facilitation of the issuance of visas.       Council Decision         2007/823/EC        of 8 November on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Montenegro on the facilitation of the issuance of visas.       Council Decision         2007/824/EC        of 8 November 2007 on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on the facilitation of the issuance of visas.       Council Decision         2007/825/EC        of 8 November 2007 on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Serbia on the facilitation of the issuance of visas.      SUMMARY     The agreements concluded with Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ("partner countries") are intended to facilitate the issuance of short-stay visas to citizens of these countries for stays of       up to 90 days      per period of 180 days.     When applying for such short-stay visas, citizens of these partner countries benefit from       simplified document requirements      for justifying the purpose of their journey to the European Union (EU). The documentary evidence to be presented consists of formal documents, such as a written request from the host organisation or other certificate, depending on the category of the applicant (business people, drivers for international transportation services, journalists, students, persons travelling for tourism or for medical reasons, representatives of civil society organisations, etc.).     EU countries’ diplomatic missions and consular posts may issue       multiple-entry visas      that are valid for up to five years to: members of the governments, parliaments, constitutional courts and supreme courts of partner countries; permanent members of official delegations; spouses and children under the age of 21 visiting citizens of partner countries legally residing in the territory of an EU country. The categories of persons who benefit from simplified document requirements may also be granted multiple-entry visas with a maximum validity period of one year. However, the person concerned must have obtained and used at least one visa during the previous year and have valid reasons for requesting a multiple-entry visa. If such a person has made use of the one-year multiple-entry visa during the previous two years, s/he may be granted a multiple-entry visa that is valid a minimum of two and a maximum of five years.     The       standard fee      for processing visa applications of partner countries’ citizens is 35 euros. This is waived for certain categories of persons, including close relatives, members of official delegations, students, disabled persons, children under the age of six, journalists, pensioners and drivers for international transportation services.     Visas are issued within       10 days      of the receipt of the application. This may be extended to up to 30 days when further scrutiny of the application is needed or may be reduced to 3 days or even less in emergencies.      Background      The participants at the EU-Western Balkans Summit held in Thessaloniki on 21 June 2003 ("Thessaloniki Agenda") agreed on the principle of liberalisation of the visa regime and began negotiations with a view to concluding the necessary agreements. This process, coupled with discussions on the conclusion of       readmission agreements      , resulted on 8 November 2007 in the adoption of a series of Council decisions, one for each of the partner countries, establishing the conclusion of agreements based on Article 62, taken in conjunction with Article 300, of the Treaty establishing the European Community (now Articles 77 and 218 respectively of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union).

act   Regulation (EU) No  254/2014  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on a multiannual consumer programme for the years 2014-20 and repealing Decision No 1926/2006/EC   summary    what is the european consumer centres network  The European Consumer Centres Network (ECC-Net) is made up of 30 offices, one in each EU country, Norway and Iceland. It provides free advice to EU consumers, either online or on the spot.   key points    Objectives    inform citizens of their rights under European and national consumer legislation,   give advice on how to deal with a consumer complaint,   help find amicable solutions to complaints lodged with traders by people buying something abroad, either while travelling or online,   redirect members of the public to an appropriate body if the Network cannot help.   ECC-Net cannot help EU residents who have a problem with a trader in their own country.  Centres are staffed by legal experts. They provide assistance on many consumer issues, including :   online shopping,   air passengers’ rights,   problems with car rentals,   various types of internet fraud,   timeshares / holiday clubs.    Funding   ECC-Net is funded through the  EU 2014-2020 multiannual consumer programme  , which is designed to provide a high level of consumer protection and to empower consumers through information and education.  A  2015 European Commission report  on 10 years of the ECC-Net found it had 650,000 direct client contacts, with annual contacts doubling between 2005 and 2014. The report highlighted the ECC-Net’s important role in applying the EU’s consumer protection laws, while also noting continuing difficulties for consumers, particularly as regards the developing Digital Single Market.   background   The ECC-Net’s role in amicably resolving complaints with traders is backed by EU legislation adopted in 2013. Directive 2013/11/EU on  alternative dispute resolution  and the Regulation (EU) No 524/2013 on  online dispute resolution  help consumers and traders to solve disputes without going to court, in a quick, low-cost and simple way.

act    Regulation (EU) No 598/2014  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on the establishment of rules and procedures with regard to the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions at Union airports within a balanced approach and repealing Directive 2002/30/EC.   summary   Regulation (EU) No 598/2014 aims to improve the noise environment around EU airports in order to ensure greater compatibility between aviation activities and residential areas, in particular in the case of night flights. The rules are based on the principles of the Balanced approach to noise management agreed by the  International Civil Aviation Organisation  (ICAO), the United Nations' body dealing with international civil aviation.  An operating restriction can take various forms, like setting a noise or a movement limit, introducing a non-addition rule (no additional movements or operations in general, or from a specific type of aircraft) or adopting a curfew for a period of night.   Scope   The rules apply only to larger airports with more than 50 000 civil aircraft movements per year. They cover civilian aircraft but exclude military, customs and police movements. The setting of specific noise thresholds, however, remains the preserve of national and local authorities.   Competent authorities   EU countries each appoint competent authorities which take charge of the procedures to be followed for the adoption of operating restrictions. These must be independent of any party that might have a conflict of interest.   Right of review   Before introducing operating restrictions, competent authorities have to give  6 months' notice  to the other Member States, the European Commission and interested parties. The Commission may, within 3 months of receiving the notice, examine the case. If it considers the procedures do not respect the rules, it notifies the competent authority which must, in turn, inform it of the action it intends to take.   Health aspects   EU legislation regarding the impacts of noise on human health (  Directive 2002/49/EC  ) must be taken into account when any decision is taken on noise reduction objectives.   Noise performance information   Decisions on operating restrictions must be taken  based on individual aircraft noise performance data  provided by the operators. This information will be centralised in a  database  and made available to competent authorities, airlines, air navigation service providers, airports and airport users.   Assessment of noise and information for residents   Competent authorities must ensure the  regular monitoring of noise levels  at airports for which they are responsible. If from their evaluation it emerges that operation restrictions could be a cost-effective measure to mitigate noise, a  consultation process  needs to be organised rapidly and interested parties have 3 months to submit their views before the adoption of restrictions.  Authorities must also ensure that information on operating restrictions is promptly and freely available to local residents and local authorities.   Phasing-out of noisy aircraft   Noise mitigation measures may include the withdrawal of, or extra restrictions upon, the noisier aircraft among those permitted by ICAO rules. Authorities will decide on the annual rate for reducing the number of movements by such aircraft for each operator at a given airport, up to a maximum of 25 %.  Regulation (EU) No 598/2014 repeals  Directive 2002/30/EC  with effect from 13 June 2016.

   Road safety: Road Safety Action Programme (2003-2010)     Road safety: Road Safety Action Programme (2003-2010)     Of all modes of transport, transport by road is the most dangerous and the most costly in terms of human lives. For this reason, the Road Safety Action Programme (2003-2010) proposes a series of measures such as stepping up checks on road traffic, deploying new road safety technologies, improving road infrastructure and measures to improve users' behaviour. The ultimate objective is to halve the number of people killed on the roads by 2010.     ACT     Communication from the Commission on the European Road Safety Action Programme. Halving the number of road accident victims in the European Union by 2010: a shared responsibility [       COM(2003) 311      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     1 300 000 accidents a year cause more than 40 000 deaths and 1 700 000 injuries on the roads. The direct and indirect cost has been estimated at 160 billion euros, i.e. 2% of the EU's GNP. Certain groups of the population or categories of road user are particularly vulnerable: young people aged between 15 and 24 (10 000 killed each year), pedestrians (7 000) and cyclists (1 800).     In its       White Paper      on European transport policy, the Commission therefore proposed that the European Union should set itself the target of halving the number of road deaths by 2010. All Member States are faced with the same road safety problems, namely excessive speed, drinking and driving, failure to wear a seat belt, the insufficient protection provided by vehicles, the existence of accident black spots, non-compliance with driving and rest times by commercial drivers and poor visibility. The forthcoming enlargement to include countries with a poor level of road safety is an additional challenge.     The main areas of action outlined in this communication are the following:      Encouraging road users to improve their behaviour       Objective      : to encourage road users to improve their behaviour through stricter compliance with the existing legislation, while harmonising the penalties at EU level, having continuous training for private and commercial drivers, improving police checks and promoting education and road user awareness campaigns.     The failure of drivers to comply with basic road safety legislation is the main cause of serious accidents. The Commission will give priority to education and awareness campaigns aimed at encouraging the use of crash helmets and seat belts and discouraging speeding and alcohol consumption. At the same time, the Commission will take action to amend the Directive on       driving licences      in order to set minimum requirements as regards driving ability.      Main measures      : to encourage the general use of crash helmets by cyclists and by all two-wheel motor vehicle users, continue specific work on young drivers, harmonise the penalties for international hauliers, establish the appropriate classification and labelling of medicines which affect driving ability, and develop best practice guidelines as regards police checks, etc.      Making use of technical progress       Objective      : to make vehicles safer through the harmonisation of passive safety measures (such as mandatory fitting of seat belts) and support for technical progress.     Given that car occupants account for 57% of fatal accident victims, it is necessary that technical progress in vehicle safety is maintained. In view of this, the Commission will continue to support EuroNCAP (the European New Car Assessment Programme) to ensure that new cars are tested in accordance with harmonised testing protocols and to inform and raise awareness among consumers.     The       eSafety      initiative launched in 2002 by the Commission and the motor vehicle industry aims to formulate recommendations and propose a number of actions at EU level. In parallel with this, research activities in the field of road safety must be strengthened, particularly within the context of the       Sixth Research Framework Programme      .      Main measures      : to introduce universal anchorage systems for child restraint devices, improve cars to reduce the severity of accidents involving pedestrians and cyclists, eliminate blind spots in heavy goods vehicles, facilitate the movement of persons with reduced mobility, and improve motorcycle safety, etc.      Encouraging the improvement of road infrastructure       Objective      : to improve road infrastructure by identifying and eliminating accident black spots.     Road infrastructure improvements can contribute towards reducing the frequency and seriousness of road traffic accidents. The early detection of abnormal traffic conditions and the transmission of relevant data to drivers can help to improve road safety. In the context of the development of the 'intelligent road', the entry into service in 2008 of the       Galileo      European satellite positioning system will enable navigation and guidance systems to be developed and make it possible to provide traffic information and to monitor vehicles carrying hazardous goods.     The Commission will submit a proposal for a framework Directive on road infrastructure safety with a view to introducing a system for the harmonised management of accident black spots and road safety audits for roads on the trans-European network (TEN).      Main measures      : to propose a Directive on road infrastructure safety, draw up technical guidelines concerning audit methods, urban safety management and speed-moderation techniques, draw up good practice guidelines for level-crossings, carry out research and demonstration projects on 'intelligent roads', carry out safety impact assessments of new projects, improve safety levels in       tunnels      , etc.      Safe commercial goods and passenger transport       Objective      : to reduce the number of accidents involving heavy goods vehicles and regulate the training of commercial drivers and compliance with driving and rest periods.     In view of the growth of heavy goods traffic, it is necessary to continue to improve the safety of the trans-European road network. Driving heavy goods vehicles is one of the most dangerous professions, and commercial drivers also have a right to a safe working environment in line with the standards on working conditions.      Main measures      : to tighten legislation on commercial drivers' working conditions, install digital tachographs in commercial vehicles, adapt to technical progress the Community legislation concerning the carriage of hazardous goods, make the wearing of seatbelts compulsory in coaches and heavy goods vehicles, improve protection in vehicles regularly used for the carriage of children, etc.      Emergency services and care for road accident victims       Objective      : to examine best practice with regard to post-accident medical care.     The improvement of the response to and care in the event of road accidents could save several thousand lives in the EU. The emergency number 112 allows telephone network operators to provide the emergency services with information to trace emergency calls in the event of an accident. Detailed information on injury severity is also needed for a better understanding of the potential for reducing injuries and for measuring the performance of the emergency medical services.      Main measures      : to carry out demonstration projects involving the whole chain of emergency service provision and study best practices in post-accident care.      Accident data collection, analysis and dissemination       Objective      : to improve the collection and analysis of data on accidents so as to identify the priority fields of action.     Although accidents are random events, it is necessary to understand their causes, circumstances and consequences, so that they can be managed and prevented or mitigated. Thorough independent investigations should be carried out at national level in accordance with a European methodology. The results should be communicated to a committee of independent experts who will be responsible for improving the legislation and adapting the methodology to technical developments.     One example is the       CARE      database, made up of police reports, which should be developed in the interests of achieving greater transparency. The Commission aims to set up a European road safety observatory within the Commission.      Main measures      : to develop and expand the CARE database, assess and improve systems for linking hospital data and national road accident statistics, set up a European road safety observatory, establish a European methodology for independent road accident investigations, set up a group of independent experts, etc.      A European Road Safety Charter      The Commission intends to mobilise all parties concerned: transport companies, vehicle and parts manufacturers, insurance companies, infrastructure operators, local and regional authorities by inviting them to subscribe to a European Road Safety Charter. Each signatory must give specific commitments which will be publicised, and their compliance with them will be monitored.

   Tobacco     Tobacco     The common organisation of markets in tobacco stabilises prices and ensures a fair standard of living for farmers in this sector. Following the entry into force of the       Mediterranean package      , from 2006 this Regulation will no longer apply to the support system for this sector.     ACT     Council Regulation (EEC) No       2075/92      of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in raw tobacco [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     From 1 July 2008, products covered by this Regulation are governed by the common organisation of agricultural markets.     The Community rules introduce a common organisation of the market in raw tobacco, which makes it possible to stabilise the markets and ensure a fair standard of living for farmers by establishing a premium system, measures for production guidance and limitation, and arrangements for trade with third countries.     However, since 1 January 2006, the system of premiums and the measures designed to contain production in this Regulation have no longer been in force. Also, the “Mediterranean” package contains       specific measures for this product      and also for hops, cotton and olive oil.      Scope      The common organisation of the market in raw tobacco covers raw or non-manufactured tobacco and tobacco refuse falling within CN heading 2401.      Premium system      The Council fixes the uniform amount of premiums per kilogram of tobacco for each group of tobacco varieties. To receive a premium, the tobacco must meet certain quality standards, come from a production area specified for the variety concerned, and be delivered in leaf form by the producer to the premises of the first processor under a cultivation contract. The premium comprises a fixed and a variable component paid to individual producers or to groups of producers. Specific aid is granted to groups of producers.     The premium system will expire as of the end of the 2005 harvest. From 1 January 2006, for harvests from 2006 to 2009, at least 40 % of the “tobacco” component of the national ceiling will be decoupled from tobacco production. Up to 60 % of this threshold is available for aid coupled to raw tobacco production. The implementing rules have been adopted. From 2010, there will be no provision for aid coupled to raw tobacco production.      System of production limitation      The maximum guarantee threshold is set at 402 953 tonnes of raw tobacco and production is subject to a quota system. The Council allocates the quotas among Member States, which in turn allocate them to groups of producers or to individual producers. No premiums are paid in excess of the quotas allocated. However, if the quotas are exceeded, premiums are allocated to the surplus quantities, subject to a limit of 10 % of the quota allocated to the producer and provided that the surpluses are deducted from the quota for the following harvest. The Commission may authorise Member States to transfer guarantee threshold quantities from one group of varieties to another, subject to budgetary neutrality.     The production limitation system will expire as of the end of the 2005 harvest. From 1 January 2006, for harvests from 2006 to 2009, expenditure will be limited by envelopes fixed by each producer Member State.      Production orientation      The       Community Tobacco Fund      : this finances in particular the following:      educational and information activities, which aim to improve public awareness of the harmful effects of tobacco consumption;       conversion measures, which aim to help raw tobacco producers to switch production to other crops or other job-creating economic activities. Studies in this field may also receive financing.      For the 2005 harvest, the Community Tobacco Fund is financed by a 3 % deduction from the premium. For the 2006 and 2007 harvests, the deduction will amount to 4 % and 5 % respectively of aid coupled to production.     From the end of 2010, €484 million in the form of additional Community support will be available for tobacco-producing regions under rural development programmes.      Trade with third countries      The collection of any charge with an effect equivalent to a customs duty, and the application of any quantitative restriction or measure with equivalent effect are prohibited in trade with third countries.     The rates of duties under the Common Customs Tariff apply to tobacco sector products.     Protective measures may be adopted if the Community market is threatened with disturbance as a result of imports or exports.      Other provisions       Control measures.      Member States are to take all necessary action to ensure and verify compliance with Community provisions concerning raw tobacco.      Comitology.      There is a Tobacco Management Committee, composed of representatives of the Member States and chaired by a representative of the European Commission.

act   Council Decision  2005/387/JHA  of 10 May 2005 on the information exchange, risk-assessment and control of new psychoactive substances.   summary   The decision establishes a mechanism for a rapid exchange of information on new psychoactive substances. It repeals  Joint Action 97/396/JHA  , which concerned only new synthetic drugs.  The decision takes note of the information on the suspected adverse reactions to be notified under the pharmacovigilance system established by Title IX of  Directive 2001/83/CE  . It also provides for an assessment of the risks which these new psychoactive substances contain, so that supervisory measures may be applied.  It applies to substances not currently listed in any of the schedules to the 1961 United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, which may pose a comparable threat to public health as the substances listed in Schedule I or II or IV thereof, and the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances, which may pose a comparable threat to public health as the substances listed in Schedule I or II or IV thereof.  Each European Union (EU) country shall ensure that its Europol National Unit and its representative in the European Information Network on Drugs and Drug Addiction (Reitox) provide information on the manufacture, traffic and use of new psychoactive substances and of preparations containing new psychoactive substances.   Europol  and the  European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction  (EMCDDA) collect the information received from EU countries through a reporting form and communicate this information immediately to each other and to the Europol national units, the EU countries’ representatives in the Reitox network, the European Commission and the  European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products  (EMEA).  If necessary, in light of the information supplied by EU countries, Europol and the EMCDDA may submit a joint report containing, among other things, information on the involvement of organised crime in the manufacture or trafficking of the new psychoactive substance, a first indication of the risks associated with the new psychoactive substance, including the health and social risks, and the characteristics of users, the date of notification of the new psychoactive substance to the EMCDDA or to Europol, etc.  The EMEA informs Europol and the EMCDDA whether in the EU or in any EU country:   the new psychoactive substance has obtained a marketing authorisation;   the substance is the subject of an application for a marketing authorisation;   a marketing authorisation that had been granted in respect of the new psychoactive substance has been suspended.   The Council, taking into account the advice of Europol and the EMCDDA, may request an assessment of the health and social risks caused by the use of, the manufacture of, and traffic in, a new psychoactive substance, the involvement of organised crime and the possible consequences of control measures.  The risk assessment report includes the physical and chemical description of the new psychoactive substance, the health and social risks associated with the new psychoactive substance and the chemical precursors that are used for the manufacture of the substance, etc.  No risk assessment is carried out on a new psychoactive substance in the absence of a Europol/EMCDDA joint report or where the new psychoactive substance concerned is at an advanced stage of assessment within the United Nations system, namely once the WHO expert committee on drug dependence has published its critical review together with a written recommendation. No assessment is carried out if the new psychoactive substance is used to manufacture a medicinal product that is the subject of an authorisation or an authorisation request. There is no assessment either if the new psychoactive substance is used to manufacture a medicinal product for which a marketing authorisation has been suspended.  Within six weeks from the date on which it received the risk assessment report, the Commission will present to the Council an initiative to have the new psychoactive substance subjected to control measures. If the Commission deems that it is not necessary to undertake this initiative, it may be presented to the Council by one or more EU countries.  If the Council decides to submit a new psychoactive substance to control measures, EU countries will endeavour to take the necessary measures to submit the new psychotropic drug to control measures and criminal penalties as provided under their legislation by virtue of their obligations under the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances and the 1961 United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.  The EMCDDA and Europol report annually to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the efficacy and achievements of the system created by this decision.  EU countries and the EMEA ensure an appropriate exchange of information between the mechanism set up by means of this decision and the pharmacovigilance systems as defined and established under Title VII of  Directive 2001/82/EC  and Title IX of Directive 2001/83/EC.

The regulation has been amended three times by:   amending Regulation (EU, Euratom)  2018/1046  — the EU’s  financial regulation  (see  summary  ) which sets out the rules for drawing up and implementing the EU budget; and   amending Regulation (EU)  2020/460  , adopted following the COVID-19 outbreak, which contains specific measures to mobilise investments in EU countries’ healthcare systems and in other sectors of their economies (   Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative   ), and   amending Regulation (EU)  2020/558  , adopted following the COVID-19 outbreak, and containing exceptional flexibility for the use of the  European Structural and Investments Funds (ESI Funds)  .     key points    Eligibility   All regions in EU countries are eligible but the aid granted depends on EU priorities and the type of region.   Key themes   The ERDF concentrates its investments on  4 key themes  :   innovation and research;   information and communication technologies (ICT);   support for  small and medium-sized enterprises  (SMEs);   promoting a low-carbon economy.    Types of investment    in  SMEs  to create and safeguard sustainable jobs,   in all types of enterprise in the fields of innovation and research, the low-carbon economy, as well as ICT where SMEs are involved,   in infrastructure providing basic services in  energy, environment, transport, and ICT  , but also in  social, health and educational infrastructure  ,    working capital in SMEs  where necessary as a temporary measure to provide an effective response to a  public health crisis  (following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic), and   in the development of  endogenous potential  .    Overall budget   The budget for 2014-2020 is over €185 billion.   Policy and budget priorities    The 4 key themes listed above are very significant for the allocation of ERDF funding which varies depending on the category of region.   The regions are defined in terms of their GDP expressed as a percentage of an EU average:    more developed regions:  GDP more than 90%    transition regions:  GDP 75%-90%    less developed regions:  GDP less than 75%     In more developed regions, (transition regions), (less developed regions), at least 80% (60%) (50%) of total ERDF funds in each country must be allocated to 2 or more of the 4 key themes, namely  innovation and research  ,  SMEs  ,  ICT  and a  low-carbon economy  ; because of its importance, at least 20% (15%) (12%) of total ERDF funds in each country must be channelled specifically towards  low-carbon economy  projects.   A minimum of 5% of ERDF funding is earmarked for  sustainable urban development  . An urban development network is to be set up at EU level to promote networking and exchange of experience on sustainable urban development.    Implementation    ERDF is implemented at  national level  by means of 7-year programmes as part of a  Partnership Agreement  between the EU country and the EU which involves the 5 European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds):   ERDF,    European Social Fund (ESF)  ,    Cohesion Fund  ,    European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF)  and    European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD)  .     This agreement is prepared by each EU country with the involvement of partners representing regional and local public authorities, as well as a wide range of social, economic, environmental and other interests.    Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative   The Coronavirus Investment Initiative, introduced by Regulation (EU) 2020/460, offers EU countries access to  €37 billion  from the ESI Funds to  strengthen health systems  and support  small and medium-sized enterprises  ,  short-time working schemes  and  community-based services  .   Coronavirus special measures: more flexibility in the use of ESI fund   Amending Regulation (EU) 2020/558 allows EU countries to transfer resources between the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund, between the different categories of regions and between the 3 funds’ specific priority areas.  From 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021, cohesion policy programmes related to COVID-19 can be financed exceptionally through 100% EU funding during the accounting year. The measures also simplify programme approval to speed up implementation, make financial instruments easier to use and simplify audits.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 21 December 2013.   background   For more information, see:    European Regional Development Fund  (  European Commission  )    Cohesion policy action against coronavirus  (  European Commission  ).
act    Regulation (EU) No 1381/2013  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing a rights, equality and citizenship programme for the period 2014 to 2020.   summary   The main goal of this programme is to further develop an EU area where equality and people’s rights are promoted, protected and implemented in the same way. Its focus is funding projects that will bring results with  added value for Europe  , including transnational projects, national projects and small-scale projects.  The programme has several specific objectives:   to  support the implementation of the principle of non-discrimination  based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, and to respect the non-discrimination principle in the  EU Charter of Fundamental Rights  ;   to prevent and combat  racism, xenophobia, homophobia  and other forms of intolerance;   to promote and protect the  rights of persons with disabilities  ;   to promote  equality between women and men  and to advance gender mainstreaming;   to  prevent and combat all forms of violence against children, young people and women, as well as violence against other groups at risk  , and to protect victims of such violence;   to promote and protect  children’s rights  ;   to  supportmaximumprotection of privacy  and personal data;   to support the exercise of   EU citizenship rights   ;   to enable EU  consumers or entrepreneurs  to enjoy their full EU rights, having regard to the projects funded under the  consumer programme  .    Types of projects   To meet its objectives, the programme will fund a variety of different projects. These include the collection of data and statistics; studies, researches, analyses and surveys; training activities; mutual learning, cooperation, awareness-raising and dissemination activities; support for main actors, such as non-governmental organisations (NGOs) with projects that bring European added value in rights, equality and citizenship.   Who can participate?   The programme is open to all organisations legally established in the EU. It can also be open to organisations legally established in the  European Free Trade Association  (EFTA), and in EU candidate countries, potential candidates and countries joining the EU, if the relevant conditions are met. Profit-making organisations can only join if they work with a non-profit or public organisation.  The programme is based on annual work programmes and has a total budget of  €439.473 million  . Its implementation will be regularly monitored and evaluated.  The new programme succeeds the  fundamental rights and citizenship  and the  Daphne III  programmes, and two sections - Anti-discrimination and diversity and Gender equality - of the programme for employment and social solidarity (  Progress  ) from 2007-13.

   The European Union and the United Nations: The choice of multilateralism     The European Union and the United Nations: The choice of multilateralism     The European Union (EU) must increase its participation in the governance system and activities of the United Nations (UN). Cooperation within the international community is an essential precondition for meeting global challenges, such as combating poverty and climate change.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 10 September 2003 - The European Union and the United Nations: the choice of multilateralism [       COM(2003) 526      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This Communication examines the means available to the European Union (EU) to contribute towards the continuous improvement of global governance, through the United Nations’ (UN)       *      governance system.     The EU therefore renews its support for the UN’s multilateral governance system       *      as an instrument for adopting concrete solutions at a global level, to the benefit of sustainable development, poverty reduction, peace and security, in particular.      Effectiveness of multilateral governance      The EU must increase its contribution with a view to adopting and applying multilateral policies and instruments. The EU’s influence could be a determining factor in the implementation of global commitments by its Member States and third country partners.     In addition, the EU must take a more active role in the institutional reform process of the UN in order to increase the effectiveness of the system, to adapt it to the development of multilateral reports, and to promote the international policy of development assistance.     Similarly, an improvement in coordination and cooperation at international level should facilitate the monitoring of commitments and strengthen actions for peace, security and       human rights      .     Lastly, European external policy supports the capacity-building of developing countries to meet their international commitments. In particular, the EU integrates the objectives of sustainable development, trade assistance, the promotion of decent working standards, and combating terrorism, drug trafficking and organised crime into its external policy programmes.      Effectiveness of collaboration      The Commission presents a set of guidelines for greater partnership between the EU and the UN, in order to:      increase policy dialogue, through increasing high-level meetings and cooperation with UN agencies;       strengthen EU representation within the UN;       increase financial cooperation and the EU’s financial contribution to UN operations;       conclude strategic partnerships with UN agencies, funds and programmes in the areas of development assistance and humanitarian aid;       conduct a strategic dialogue on coordinating humanitarian aid activities.      Political and technical cooperation must also be increased in the area of peace and security, whether for       conflict prevention      , crisis management or post-crisis reconstruction. This partnership must be systematically extended to the competent regional organisations (such as the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe).      Promoting the values and interests of the EU      The EU contributes substantially to the development of policies adopted within the UN. However, it is still necessary to improve the coordination of its Member States’ positions, to ensure that the objectives of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) are consistent with the positions of the UN Security Council, and also to increase the role of EU delegations to the UN.     In order to increase the influence of the EU within the UN governance system, the Commission recommends:      coordinating the Member States’ positions and participating in the decision-making process as soon as possible, particularly regarding international social policy, health, human rights, development cooperation and humanitarian aid;       improving coordination and the EU’s dialogue with countries or groups of countries affected by specific issues;       ensuring that European policies are compatible with international policies, and ensuring that effective European representation is in place with regard to the work of the UN on subjects which affect the EU.        Key terms         United Nations governance system: a concept defined by the Commission as applying to the main bodies of the UN (the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and their subsidiary bodies, the Security Council and the Secretariat), and the programmes, funds and specialised institutions of the United Nations, including the Bretton Woods institutions (the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund).         Multilateral governance: a method of organisation of international relations, involving more than two States.

   Cross-border cooperation (CBC) 2007-2013     Cross-border cooperation (CBC) 2007-2013     Cross-border cooperation (CBC) with the European Union's (EU) neighbouring countries aims at promoting a coherent and integrated approach to regional development, dealing with common challenges, guaranteeing effectiveness and security at the external borders and encouraging local cooperation. The strategy paper for the period 2007-2013 and the regional indicative programme for the period 2007-2010 set out the details of implementation (programmes, beneficiaries, financial allocations).     ACT     European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument -       Cross-border cooperation strategy paper 2007-2013, Indicative Programme 2007-2010      .     SUMMARY     Cross-border cooperation (CBC) is a priority of the       European Neighbourhood Policy      (ENP) and of the strategic partnership with Russia. It focuses on the Member States and the countries benefiting from the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (       ENPI      ). It concerns both land and maritime borders, even if geographical eligibility is defined by the ENPI.     The CBC concerns Eastern Europe, the southern Caucasus and the Southern Mediterranean specifically Algeria, Armenia, the Palestinian Authority, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Moldova, Syria, Tunisia, Ukraine and Russia.      Objectives and programmes      Despite their differences and socio-economic disparities, frontier regions face several common challenges. These constitute the priorities and key objectives of the CBC, namely:       to promote harmonious economic and social development in regions located on either side of common frontiers.        Special attention is given to local trade and investments, the promotion of joint enterprises, tourism, investments in local infrastructure and cooperation in the energy, transport and communications sectors;        to deal with common challenges in areas such as the environment, public health and prevention and fight against organised crime.        Actions include joint planning and surveillance activities, improved management of natural resources, fisheries resources and waste. The water pollution issue is essential within the context of shared sea basins, i.e. the Baltic, Black and Mediterranean Seas. Actions also include measures to encourage cooperation in the surveillance and treatment of communicable diseases and increased cooperation in the fight against corruption, illegal immigration and human trafficking;        to guarantee secure and efficient borders        by improving operations and procedures for managing borders, strengthening the security of the international logistics chain or even by improving infrastructures and equipment at borders;        to promote local people-to people actions        at cross-border level by improving civil society contacts. Educational, social and cultural cooperation can play an essential role in promoting democracy and EU values.      The CBC covers two       categories of programmes      , i.e. programmes concerning:       Land borders and sea routes        for regions located along important land borders or sea routes. These programmes can involve two or more countries. Nine programmes have been drawn up for land borders and concern the following: Kolartic/Russia, Karelia/Russia, South-East Finland/Russia, Estonia/Latvia/Russia, Lithuania/Poland/Russia, Hungary/Slovakia/Romania/Ukraine. Three programmes have been drawn up for sea routes: the Spain/Morocco and Italy/Tunisia programmes and the CBC Atlantic programme;        sea basins        for regions located at the external frontiers of the EU, along one of the three sea basins (Baltic, Black and Mediterranean Seas).      The initiatives can be based on existing infrastructures such as intergovernmental cross-border cooperation committees (Finland and Russia organise such meetings on a regular basis, as do Poland and Ukraine), intergovernmental regional cooperation bodies (       Council of the Baltic Sea States      ,       Black Sea Economic Cooperation      , etc.) or other associations and networks created to promote regional or border cooperation (       Eurocities      ,       Euroregions      , etc.).      Arrangements      The partners draw up joint programmes at local, regional and national level which they propose to the Commission. They are responsible not only for detailed programming but also for the management and implementation of these programmes. Political and institutional willingness to achieve and embrace the objectives is therefore essential to guarantee the effectiveness of CBC. Involvement and participation of civil society in these programmes are also of fundamental importance.      Funding      is ensured by the ENPI for beneficiary countries and by the European Regional Development Fund (       ERDF      ) for Member States. Funding for the period 2007-2010 amounts to 583.28 million (ENPI-ERDF). For the period 2011-2013, it will amount to 535.15 million. A mid-term evaluation, scheduled for 2010, will allow adaptation and re-evaluation of resources, if necessary.     The following three types of       results      are expected:      the results of the programme as a whole, such as the achievement of objectives, ways of improving coordination, the effectiveness of contributions;       results associated with the implementation of key objectives such as sustainable economic and social development, strengthening of administrative practices, identification of challenges and a suitable and effective response to these challenges;       the specific results of the programmes drawn up by partners such as long-term cooperation links, strengthening of networks and enhanced commitment.      In order to measure the impact, the partners will set out       indicators      as programmes are being drawn up. Indicators are programme-specific for each of the objectives relating to regional trade, social development, statistics or border operations or cooperation opportunities created. Other indicators are general, such as the number of partners, the number of CBC projects implemented successfully, etc.      Background      CBC pursues cross-border cooperation programmes launched under previous programmes (       Tacis      ,       MEDA      ,       Phare      ,       Interreg      ). On the basis of the lessons learnt from those programmes, CBC, under the ENPI, assigns more responsibility to the players involved by decentralising programing, management and implementation. In this way, CBC supplements the achievement of ENP objectives at bilateral level.

summary of   Communication (COM(2010) 2020 final) – Europe 2020: A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth   what is the aim of the europe 2020 strategy  The Europe 2020 strategy aims to ensure that the economic revival of the European Union (EU) following the economic and financial crisis is supported by a series of reforms in order to build solid foundations for growth and job creation by 2020. While addressing the structural weaknesses of the EU’s economy and economic and social issues, the strategy also takes account of the longer-term challenges of globalisation, pressure on resources and ageing.   key points    The Europe 2020 strategy should enable the EU to  achieve growth  that is:    smart  , through the development of knowledge and innovation;    sustainable  , based on a greener, more resource efficient and more competitive economy;    inclusive  , aimed at strengthening employment and social and territorial cohesion.     The EU has set itself five major  targets for this ambition to be achieved by 2020  :   increasing the employment rate of the population aged 20-64 to at least 75 %;   investing 3 % of gross domestic product in research and development;   reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20 %, increasing the share of renewable energies to 20 % and increasing energy efficiency by 20 %;   reducing the school drop-out rate to less than 10 % and increasing the proportion of tertiary degrees to at least 40 %;   reducing the number of people threatened by poverty or social exclusion by 20 million.     The Europe 2020 strategy targets are also supported by  7flagship initiatives  at European level and in EU countries: the  Innovation Union  ;  Youth on the move  ; the  Digital Agenda for Europe  ; a  Resource-efficient Europe  ; an  industrial policy for the globalisation era  ; the  agenda for new skills and jobs  ; and the  European Platform against Poverty  .   At European level, the single market, the  EU budget  and the European external policy are additional levers in achieving the targets of the Europe 2020 strategy.    Implementation of the strategy under the European Semester    The Europe 2020 strategy is implemented through broad economic policy guidelines of EU countries and the EU (  Council recommendation (EU) 2015/1184  ) and guidelines for employment policies of EU countries (  Council Decision (EU) 2015/1848  ).   The EU countries have been invited to translate the Europe 2020 targets into national targets. Every year, in April, they publish their national reform programmes in which they set out the actions undertaken to achieve these national targets.   The  European Commission  is responsible for  monitoring progress  . It presents an annual growth review, assesses the reform agendas of EU countries and submits  specific recommendations for each country  .
summary of   Regulation (EU) 2018/643 on rail transport statistics   what is the aim of the regulation   It applies to all railways in the EU.   It establishes common rules for producing EU-wide rail transport statistics.   It  recasts  and repeals Regulation (EC) No  91/2003  which had been substantially amended several times.   key points    EU countries  :   must report statistics for all rail transport on their territory and break these down by country if the service is international;   may exclude from the statistics railways which   operate within industrial zones or harbours   provide local tourist services, such as historical steam trains;     coordinate the data sources used and ensure the quality of the statistics;   send the statistics to  Eurostat, the EU’s statistical office  .   The  statistics required  cover:   quarterly and annual data on goods and passengers carried, including per kilometre;   an annual breakdown by region every 5 years of goods and passengers transported;   traffic flows every 5 years on the number of goods and passenger trains;   detailed classification of the different types of goods, including dangerous items.   The  national information  collected by a public or private body may come from:   compulsory surveys;   administrative or regulatory data;   statistical estimation procedures;   professional rail organisations;    ad hoc  studies.    Eurostat  :   sends out the statistics based on the data it receives;   develops and publishes methodology to help national authorities collect quality data.   The  European Commission  :   presents a report to the  European Parliament  and the  Council  by 31 December 2020 — and then every 4 years — on the legislation’s implementation;   has the renewable 5-year power from 13 December 2016 to use  delegated acts  , in line with  Article 290  of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, to adapt technical definitions in the light of new developments;   is assisted by the  European Statistical System Committee  .   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 22 May 2018. Regulation (EU) 2018/643  revised  and replaced Regulation (EC) No  91/2003  (and its subsequent amendments).   background   The Commission needs rail statistics to monitor and develop the  common transport policy  , including  trans-European networks  , and if necessary, to act to improve rail transport safety.  Common concepts and standards ensure national statistics are comparable and help avoid duplication.
summary of   Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the Governance of the Energy Union   what is the aim of the regulation   It aims to ensure that the EU’s  Energy Union Strategy  is implemented in a coordinated and coherent manner across its 5 dimensions.   More broadly, it also aims to ensure that the Energy Union achieves its objectives, in particular the targets of the  2030 policy framework for climate and energy  and of the  Paris Agreement on climate change  .   It repeals Regulation (EU) No  525/2013  on the monitoring and reporting mechanism for greenhouse gas emissions.   key points    The Energy Union strategy  has 5 dimensions:    energy security  ;    internal energy market  ;    energy efficiency  ;    decarbonisation  ;    research, innovation and competitiveness  .   The regulation has a number of key features:   it requires EU countries to produce a  national integrated energy and climate plan  for the period 2021 to 2030 by 1 January 2019, and then every 10 years for the following 10-year periods;   it establishes a  consultation process  between the  European Commission  and EU countries, and regional cooperation between EU countries, before the plans are finalised, and then every 10 years for the following 10-year periods. For the period to 2030, the plans need to be updated by 30 June 2024;   it requires EU countries to prepare and report to the Commission  long-term low-emission strategies  with a  50-year perspective  , in view of contributing to broader sustainable development goals and the long-term goal set by the Paris Agreement;   it requires EU countries to produce  biennial progress reports  on the implementation of the plans from 2021 onwards across the 5 dimensions of the Energy Union, to track progress;   it requires the Commission to  monitor and assess EU countries’ progress  towards the targets, objectives and contributions set in their national plans;   it sets out the requirements for  national and EU inventory systems  for greenhouse gas emissions, policies, measures and projections.     Delegated acts     The Commission has the power to adopt delegated acts to amend the general framework for the integrated national energy and climate plans template for the purpose of adapting the template to amendments to the EU’s Energy and Climate policy framework that are directly and specifically related to the EU’s contributions under the  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  and the Paris Agreement, take account of changes in the global warming potentials and internationally agreed inventory guidelines, and set substantive requirements for the EU inventory system and set up the registries.   Delegated Regulation (EU)  2020/1044  supplements Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 with regard to values for global warming potentials and the greenhouse gas inventory guidelines, and with regard to the EU’s inventory system. It also repeals Delegated Regulation (EU) No  666/2014  from 1 January 2021.   Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1044 applies to reports submitted by EU countries for 2021 onwards.   EU countries and the Commission will use the global warming potentials listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2020/1044 for the purpose of determining and reporting greenhouse gas inventories data.     from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 24 December 2018.   background   For more information, see:    Energy Union  (  European Commission  ).
   A coherent framework of indicators and benchmarks for monitoring the Lisbon objectives     A coherent framework of indicators and benchmarks for monitoring the Lisbon objectives     The purpose of the framework of indicators and benchmarks proposed in this communication is to monitor the Lisbon objectives in education and training. Progress in this field will be evaluated in the context of the aim of making European education and training systems a world quality reference by 2010.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 21 February 2007 – “A coherent framework of indicators and benchmarks for monitoring progress towards the Lisbon objectives in education and training” [       COM(2007) 61      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Indicators and benchmarks are needed to monitor the progress that is essential to the Lisbon process. The current framework is based on the       Education and Training 2010      programme and consists of a set of 20 essential indicators (the “core indicators”), which are supported by context indicators, and five benchmarks.     This framework facilitates the sharing of experiences and best practice and makes it possible to:      provide statistical underpinning for key policy messages;       analyse progress towards the Lisbon objectives, at both European Union (EU) and national level;       identify examples of good performance that can be disseminated in EU countries;       compare EU performance with that of non-EU countries, such as the USA and Japan.       FRAMEWORK OF INDICATORS AND BENCHMARKS      The framework of indicators and benchmarks consists of       core indicators      , which are of a general nature, and       context indicators      , which allow a greater degree of precision.     The indicators and benchmarks are centred around eight key policy domains identified in the Education and Training 2010 strategy, namely:      making education and training fairer;       promoting efficiency in education and training;       making lifelong learning a reality;       key skills for young people;       modernising school education;       modernising vocational education and training (the         Copenhagen process        );       modernising higher education (the         Bologna process        );       employability.       Making education and training fairer      European education and training systems must be fair. Fairness is assessed by looking at the extent to which individuals take advantage of education and training in terms of opportunities, access, treatment and outcomes. Certain key themes, such as the promotion of gender equality and the integration of ethnic minorities and disabled persons, need to be monitored.     In order to ensure effective participation in lifelong learning, the proportion of early school-leavers must be reduced. The Council has therefore set a benchmark of       limiting to 10% the proportion of early school-leavers      .     Progress in this area will be assessed on the basis of the following core indicators:      participation in pre-school education;       special needs education;       early school-leavers.      The indicator on the stratification of education and training systems will make it possible to assess the impact of the structure of education and training systems and differences between educational establishments.      Promoting efficiency in education and training      It has been shown that improving efficiency is not necessarily detrimental to the fairness of education systems. Efficiency and fairness can go hand in hand.     The efficiency of European education and training systems is mainly a matter of making the best possible use of resources. Private and public investment must be supported, as must investment in higher education. Indeed, the latter receives less funding than in some non-EU countries.     Efficiency will be assessed in the light of investment in education and training.      Making lifelong learning a reality      Lifelong learning is crucial for competitiveness, employability, economic prosperity, social inclusion, active citizenship and the personal fulfilment of people living and working in the knowledge-based economy.     In order to have a career and participate fully in lifelong learning, it is essential to complete upper secondary education. In view of this, the Council has adopted two benchmarks, namely that       by 2010, 85% of young people should complete upper secondary education and that by 2010, 12.5% of the adult population should participate in lifelong learning      .     The core indicators for monitoring progress in this area are:      participation of adults in lifelong learning;       adults’ skills.      What is more, the indicator on upper secondary completion rates will make it possible to assess the degree to which young people are ready to participate in lifelong learning.      Key skills for young people      Acquiring basic skills is an essential prerequisite for working in a knowledge-based society. This is why the Council has set a benchmark aimed at       reducing by at least 20% the number of low-achieving 15-year-olds in reading as compared to the 2000 level      .     The core indicators allowing an overall assessment of basic skills are based on the following key skills:      literacy in reading, mathematics and science;       language skills;       ICT (information and communication technologies) skills;       civic skills;       learning to learn.       Modernising school education      The quality of school education depends on improving the initial training of teachers and the participation of all teachers in continuing professional development. The Council has also deemed that tools such as school self-evaluation are essential. Accordingly, training in the management and use of these tools must be promoted.     Progress in this area will be monitored using the following core indicators:      early school-leavers;       school management;       schools as multi-purpose local learning centres;       professional development of teachers and trainers.       Modernising vocational education and training (VET)      In line with the Copenhagen process, the image and appeal of vocational training for employers must be improved, levels of participation in VET must be increased and quality and flexibility in initial vocational education and training must be encouraged.     Progress will be assessed using the core indicator on upper secondary completion rates among young people, with particular attention being given to vocational streams.     The indicator on the stratification of education and training systems measures the degree to which initial vocational education and training is available in the structure of the education and training system.     Furthermore, the context indicator on participation in continuing vocational education and training will allow an assessment of the role of businesses in the participation of their employees in continuing vocational training and its financing.      Modernising higher education      Modernising higher education and increasing funding to university research will contribute to the EU’s objective of becoming a competitive knowledge-based economy. Moreover, the Bologna process has the aim of creating, by 2010, a European Higher Education Area with a common degree structure so as to encourage mobility among students and workers.     The benchmarks for assessing the modernisation of higher education are that of       devoting at least 2% of GDP      (including both public and private funding)       by 2015 to modernising higher education      and that of       increasing by 15% the number of graduates in mathematics, science and technology by 2010      .     Progress will be measured using the following three core indicators:      higher education graduates;       transnational mobility of students in higher education;       investment in education and training.       Employability      In order to meet the challenge of achieving a higher level of employment, the Council has set objectives for overall employment rates, employment rates for older workers and employment rates for women.     People’s employability and capacity to adapt throughout their life depend on their level of education and their key skills.     The indicators used for employability are:      educational attainment of the population;       adults’ skills;       results produced by education and training.       DATA SOURCES SUPPORTING THE COHERENT FRAMEWORK      The framework of indicators and benchmarks is based on data that mainly come from the European Statistical System (ESS).      Data provided by the ESS      Several different sources are used within the ESS to produce data on education and training and establish indicators. These can be divided into two groups.     The first group encompasses the annual       UNESCO      /       OECD      /       Eurostat      (UOE) data collection on formal education systems in EU countries, the five-yearly Continuing Vocational Training Survey (CVTS), which collects information on training at enterprise level and the five-yearly Adult Education Survey (AES), which provides information on adult learning habits.     The second group includes general sources of information such as the Labour Force Survey (LFS) and the EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC). There are also other specific sources (surveys on the use of ICT in households and companies).     Acquiring internationally comparable data is a matter of interest for individual countries. Various countries are thus making their statistical infrastructures better equipped to produce information on the schools and students whose work the EU is tracking.      Data produced outside the ESS      The ESS cannot provide the full statistical infrastructure required for the framework of indicators and benchmarks.       Eurydice      and       Cedefop      , in cooperation with Eurostat, are responsible for the data and context indicators that support this framework.     Furthermore, the Commission may decide to put forward its own procedures for creating data-collection tools, such as in the field of language knowledge. It has also prepared a recommendation on the creation of a survey tool in the area of “learning to learn”, and a transnational pilot survey is planned for 2007.     The Commission also cooperates with international organisations such as the OECD, which produce their own indicators, and with EU countries.      BACKGROUND      In 2002, the Heads of State and Government agreed to make European education and training systems a world quality reference by 2010. As part of the Lisbon strategy, common objectives for improving education and training systems were adopted by the Ministers of Education. The Education and Training 2010 work programme was drawn up so as to achieve these objectives.     The coherent framework of indicators and benchmarks covered by this communication will make it possible to assess the progress made. It replaces the framework that was in place for the 2004-06 period, in comparison with which it is more streamlined. Indeed, the 2004-06 framework was made up of 29 indicators and five benchmarks intended to measure progress in the 13 objectives then in place.

   Integrating the environment into aerial transport     Integrating the environment into aerial transport     The Commission evaluates ways of improving the environmental performance of activities linked to air transport in order to offset the environmental impact of growth in this sector.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 1 December 1998 to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Air Transport and the Environment [       COM(1999) 640      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Globally, air transport contributes to the greenhouse effect and to the depletion of the ozone layer. Regionally, it contributes to acidification, ozone formation and eutrophication. Locally, in the vicinity of airports, air transport is partly the cause of noise and air pollution.     This communication sets out the strategy the European Union is to pursue to put in place a coherent and environmentally friendly policy in the field of air transport.      The pillars of the strategy      The first pillar of the strategy proposed in the communication is the improvement of technical environmental standards on noise and gaseous emissions. One example of practical action is the improvement of air traffic management systems, which should allow a major saving in fuel consumption.     The communication also proposes the introduction of economic and regulatory market incentives to enhance the competitive edge of operators and users which choose to use state-of-the-art technologies and environmentally friendly operations. The Commission will work to integrate environmental costs into charging systems and to improve the infrastructure at intermodal connecting points so that users and operators can actually choose more environmentally friendly services.     Another pillar indicated in the communication is environmental protection measures to be applied in airports. Under this pillar of the Community strategy, various action is proposed to assist airports, limit noise and link airports to other modes of transport.     The communication emphasises the need to encourage research and innovation relating to the environmental performance of aircraft, including assessment of the atmospheric effect of aircraft exhaust gas emissions. A long-term strategy of this nature is essential.     The communication invites the air transport industry to sign voluntary environmental agreements and to register under the       EMAS scheme      .     The Commission underlines the importance of adopting international solutions within the       International Civil Aviation Organisation      (ICAO).     RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 27 September 2005:      Reducing the Climate Change Impact of Aviation [       COM(2005) 459      - Not published in the Official Journal].     The Commission considers the options available for reducing the impact of the air transport sector on climate change. In particular, it suggests - in addition to pursuing the possibilities offered in research, air traffic management and energy taxation - integrating the air transport sector into the Community Emissions Trading Scheme.       Directive 2002/30/EC        of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 March 2002 on the establishment of rules and procedures with regard to the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions at Community airports [Official Journal L 85 of 28 March 2002].      The purpose of this Directive is to prevent an overall increase in noise and to seek to reduce aircraft noise in order to improve the current acoustic environment, in particular by gradually phasing out the noisiest aircraft.      Communication [         COM(2000) 821        final      -       Not published in the Official Journal].      Communication from the Commission to the Council: Community objectives for the 33rd Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and ICAO Council decisions prior to this Assembly in the field of environmental protection. The communication sets out the following Community objectives:      deal with the impact, in terms of noise pollution, of the increase in demand for air transport: the Community will seek the adoption both of a resolution on limiting the operation of the least noise-efficient aircraft, and of a more stringent noise standard for aircraft;       introduce more stringent standards for all gaseous emissions from air transport;       strengthening economic incentives to improve the environmental performance of aircraft.

summary of   Directive 2000/43/EC — implementing equal treatment irrespective of racial or ethnic origin   what is the aim of the directive   It aims to combat discrimination on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin.   It lays down minimum requirements for implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons in the European Union (EU).   By discouraging discrimination, it should help to increase participation in economic and social life and reduce social exclusion.   key points    This directive is based on the principle of  equal treatment between persons  . It forbids both direct  *  and indirect  *  discrimination, harassment  *  , instructions to discriminate and victimisation  *  .   The directive applies to all persons and to all sectors of activity, regarding:   access to employment;   working conditions, including promotion, pay and dismissals;   access to vocational training;   involvement in workers’ or employers’ organisations, and in any professional organisation;   access to social protection and to healthcare;   education;   social advantages;   access to and supply of goods and services, including housing.     The directive does not cover difference of treatment based on nationality, or the conditions of entry and residence for citizens from non-EU countries.    Derogations from the principle of equal treatment    In the field of employment, a derogation may be authorised where race or ethnic origin constitutes a genuine professional requirement. This derogation must be justifiable by the nature of the activity and the conditions under which it is exercised. It must be legitimate and proportionate.   The directive does not oppose positive action, namely national measures aimed at preventing or compensating for disadvantages connected with race or ethnic origin.    Remedies and enforcement    Anyone who believes themselves to be a victim of discrimination on grounds of racial or ethnic origin must have access to legal and/or administrative proceedings. Associations or other interested legal persons may also undertake proceedings either on behalf of, or in support of the complainant.   The victim of discrimination only needs to establish a presumption of discrimination after which it is for the respondent to prove that there has been no discrimination.   Social dialogue and civil dialogue    The social partners ensure the promotion of equal treatment, specifically by monitoring practices in the workplace, producing codes of conducts and concluding collective agreements. More generally, the directive encourages the conclusion of agreements establishing non-discrimination rules in the fields which fall within the scope of collective bargaining.   Civil dialogue with the  civil society organisations  concerned is also encouraged.    Bodies for the promotion of the principle   Each EU country must establish at least one body dedicated to combating discrimination, which is, in particular, responsible for helping victims and conducting independent studies.   Council Recommendation   In 2013, the  Council  adopted a  recommendation  calling for measures to be taken in a number of area, including anti-discrimination, to  strengthen the integration of Roma people  . The recommendation builds upon Directive 2000/43/EC and underlines the importance of its practical enforcement.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 19 July 2000. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 19 July 2003.   background   The Treaty of Lisbon (  Article 19  of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU) provides the EU with a legal basis to combat all forms of discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.   * key terms     Direct discrimination:  where one person is treated less favourably than another is, has been or would be treated in a comparable situation on grounds of racial or ethnic origin.     Indirect discrimination:  where an apparently neutral rule, criterion or practice would put persons of a racial or ethnic origin at a particular disadvantage compared with other persons, unless that rule, criterion or practice is objectively justified by a legitimate aim and the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary.     Harrassment:  when an unwanted conduct related to racial or ethnic origin takes place with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person and of creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment.     Victimisation:  unjust or cruel treatment of someone who complains of discrimination or who assists someone else in a complaint of discrimination.
   Fundamental rights and citizenship (2007-13)     Fundamental rights and citizenship (2007-13)     This decision establishes the "Fundamental rights and citizenship" programme for the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013. Forming part of the general programme "Fundamental rights and justice", it aims to promote the development of a European society based on respect for fundamental rights, to strengthen civil society and encourage an open and transparent dialogue, to fight racism and xenophobia and to improve mutual understanding between the judicial and administrative authorities and the legal professions.     ACT     Council Decision       2007/252/EC      of 19 April 2007 establishing for the period 2007-2013 the specific programme "Fundamental rights and citizenship" as part of the General programme "Fundamental Rights and Justice".     SUMMARY     This decision establishes the programme "Fundamental rights and citizenship", which is intended to promote the development of a European society based on respect for fundamental rights. To this end, the programme provides for actions conducted by the European Commission, European Union (EU) countries and non-governmental organisations.      A European society based on respect for fundamental rights      The programme supports the development of a European society based on respect for the fundamental rights recognised in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, including the rights resulting from citizenship of the Union. For this purpose, the programme aims to:      strengthen civil society and encourage an open, transparent and regular dialogue on fundamental rights;       combat racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism;       promote better understanding between religions and cultures;       promote increased tolerance in the whole of the EU;       strengthen contacts, exchanges of information and networks between the judicial and administrative authorities and the legal professions;       encourage judicial training in order to improve mutual understanding between the abovementioned authorities and professions.      Furthermore, the       specific objectives      of the programme are to:      promote fundamental rights and inform all citizens about their rights, including those resulting from EU citizenship;       encourage EU citizens to participate actively in the democratic life of the Union;       examine respect for fundamental rights in the EU and its countries when Union law is implemented;       support non-governmental organisations and other bodies of civil society so that they can actively promote fundamental rights, the rule of law and democracy;       create the relevant structures to promote inter-faith and multicultural dialogue at EU level.       Specific actions to achieve the objectives of the programme      The programme provides for actions conducted by the Commission, the authorities of EU countries and non-governmental organisations. It also provides for grants following requests for proposals.     The types of actions comprise the following:       specific actions        conducted by the Commission (studies and research work, polls and investigations, conferences and meetings of experts, organising actions and public events, creating and running websites, developing and distributing information media, etc.);        transnational projects        of EU interest presented by an authority or a body of an EU country or an international or non-governmental organisation. At least two EU countries or at least one EU country and a candidate country or an acceding country must participate in these projects;        support for non-governmental organisations        or other bodies pursuing objectives of general European interest that are covered by the programme;        operating subsidies        for the joint financing of the expenses connected with the permanent working programme of the Conference of the European Constitutional Courts and of the Association of the Councils of State and Supreme Administrative Jurisdictions of the European Union. These bodies manage a number of databases that gather together national decisions relating to the implementation of Union law. The expenses must be incurred for an objective of general European interest.       A programme for citizens      The programme is addressed to EU nationals and nationals of non-EU countries who are lawfully resident within the territory of the Union. It is also addressed to citizens of the participating countries (acceding countries, candidate countries and the countries of the Western Balkans participating in the stabilisation and association process). Other target groups are organisations of civil society and other groups that defend the objectives of the programme.     Provided that they are established in the EU or in one of the non-EU countries participating in the programme, access to the programme is open to the following entities:      public or private institutions and bodies;       universities;       research institutes;       non-governmental organisations;       national, regional or local authorities;       international organisations;       other non-profit-making organisations.      The programme makes possible joint activities with competent international organisations in the field of fundamental rights, such as the Council of Europe.      Monitoring and implementing the programme      Every year, the Commission publishes a list of the actions financed under this programme. The available budgetary resources are entered annually in the general budget of the EU. The available annual credits are authorised by the budgetary authority (the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union) within the limits of the financial framework.     The Commission shall ensure that the beneficiary presents technical and financial reports on the state of progress of the work in respect of any action financed by the programme, as well as a final report within three months of the end of the action. Furthermore, the Commission ensures that the EU's financial interests are protected by applying preventive measures against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity.     The Commission will present an annual stocktaking of the implementation of the programme, an intermediate report assessing the results obtained (by 31 March 2011 at the latest), a communication on the continuation of the programme (by 30 August 2012 at the latest) and an assessment report after the programme finishes (by 31 December 2014 at the latest).      Complementarity with other EU programmes      This programme seeks to complement and establish synergies with other EU programmes, in particular the framework programmes "Security and Safeguarding Liberties" and "       Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows      ", as well as with the       PROGRESS      programme.

   Sustainable power generation from fossil fuels     Sustainable power generation from fossil fuels     In this Communication the Commission assesses how and at what cost power can be generated from fossil fuels in future while reducing the associated greenhouse gas emissions.     ACT     Commission Communication of 10 January 2007 "Sustainable power generation from fossil fuels: aiming for near-zero emissions from coal after 2020" [       COM(2006) 843      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The large-scale use of fossil fuels (oil, natural gas and coal) is the main cause of man-made climate change resulting from the CO2 emissions produced. The power generation sector accounts for a major proportion of these emissions and the upward trend is set to continue in future.     Over 50% of EU electricity comes from fossil fuels, mainly coal, which accounts for about 30% of overall electricity generation in the EU. To help secure the EU's energy supply, coal will continue to play a key role in the energy sources used. In 2005 CO2 emissions from coal-based electricity generation accounted for 70% of total CO2 emissions due to electricity generation in the EU, and 24% of CO2 emissions from all sectors taken together.     These energy sources, particularly coal, will also become more and more important in power generation in certain parts of the world over the coming decades (China and India in particular) as a result of the significant rise in demand for energy.     It is therefore essential for the EU to set up the right framework now for the development and distribution of sustainable coal technologies, and thus limit CO2 emissions from the use of coal for electricity generation.     The improvements already made in coal technologies (increase in energy efficiency and a reduction in acid rain and local atmospheric pollution due to SO2, NOx and particulate emissions) show that significant technological progress is possible, in particular by applying the principle of carbon capture and storage (CCS).      Technologies for the sustainable use of fossil fuels      Technologies for the sustainable use of coal will be based on an optimum combination of 'clean coal' technologies (improving yield and reducing atmospheric emissions) and CCS technologies. Continued development of these technologies and demonstrating their commercial viability will lead to their large-scale use.     To achieve this, a substantial increase in funding for research is required for the development of technological demonstration projects at both national and Community level. Routine cooperation between the industrial sector and the pubic authorities is called for, via a coordination and support structure based on the Zero Emission Fossil Fuel Power Plant Technology Platform launched in 2006. The Commission is also to study what other appropriate demonstration measures should be taken in the short term.     The best available technology will have to be used for modernising the EU's stock of coal-fired power plants, enabling CO2 emissions generated by them to be cut by 20% by 2020. The Commission will assess whether using the best available technology is effective and will consider proposing the adoption of legally binding instruments to promote it where necessary.      A framework for developing these technologies      The EU needs a regulatory and economic framework that rewards low-carbon technologies. It will have to ensure the long-term use of sustainable coal technologies to promote investment and the transition to such technologies.     The Commission therefore recommends:      assessing the potential risks involved in carbon capture and storage, a process which will involve public internet-based consultation;       proposing requirements for using these technologies, allowing the risks to be properly managed;       incorporating these requirements into the existing regulatory framework, i.e. the         greenhouse gas emission quota exchange system        and the         Environmental Impact Assessment        and         Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directives        .      The Commission also thinks that new coal-fired power plants should be built with CCS systems by 2020 and that existing plants should be gradually retrofitted. Incentives could be provided (by adopting legally binding objectives and setting up EU storage sites, for example).     The EU will also continue its efforts at international level to conclude an agreement to limit the rise in the Earth's temperature to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. CCS will be one of the options to be used in this connection. The EU will support the amendment of some of the existing international agreements and conventions to reduce the barriers to CCS technologies (for example under the seabed).      Costs and benefits of sustainable fossil fuels technologies      The construction of new CCS-ready plants should not necessarily lead to additional costs, while the construction of plants for the industrial-scale demonstration of sustainable coal use will require substantial financial resources, as will the retrofitting of existing power plants after 2020.     CCS technologies are as yet too costly for large-scale use. However, technological improvements over the coming years and the side benefits of CCS should limit the rise in the cost of electricity from plants using these technologies to 10% of current levels by 2020 or even fully cancel them out. Also, the potential rise in the cost of electricity generated in coal-fired plants should not translate, at least not fully, into higher electricity prices for consumers.     The Commission thinks that any negative environmental effects of CCS will stem mainly from potential leakage. However, the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concludes that the proportion of CO2 retained in well-selected and well-managed storage sites is very likely to exceed 99% over 100 years.     The sustainable use of fossil fuels, in particular CCS, will make it possible to eliminate up to 90% of the carbon emissions from fossil-fuel power plants, i.e. an overall reduction in CO2 emissions in the 27 EU Member States of 27 to 30% by 2030 compared to 2000. The use of appropriate technologies will also enable the atmospheric pollutants traditionally associated with coal combustion, including NOx and SO2, to be reduced, thus resulting in lower local environmental and health costs.     If the EU can display strong international leadership in the development of sustainable fossil fuel technologies, this will enable it to create jobs and export its technology, and will have a positive knock-on effect on third countries. To achieve this, there will need to be close cooperation, particularly at technological and trade level, with coal-using countries, including China, the United States, India and the developing countries.      Background      The Communication is part of the "energy package" published by the Commission in January 2007, which sets out a new European energy policy with quantified targets.     RELATED ACTS      Commission Communication of 10 January 2007 on an Energy Policy for Europe [         COM(2007) 1        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      This Communication is the main feature of the package of measures presented by the Commission in January 2007 (the "energy package"). After reviewing the energy challenges facing Europe, in particular climate change and the EU's security of supply, the Commission details a number of actions relating, among other things, to the internal energy market, security of supply, energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, energy technologies and international energy policy.      Commission Communication of 10 January 2007 "Limiting Global Climate Change to 2 degrees Celsius - The way ahead for 2020 and beyond" [         COM(2007) 2        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      In this Communication the Commission looks at the costs and benefits of tackling climate change and recommends a number of measures to limit global warming to 2° Celsius. Some of the measures apply to the European Union alone (binding greenhouse gas emission targets and the adoption of energy measures, among others) while others are international in outlook (in particular, negotiation of an international agreement).      Commission         Green Paper        of 8 March 2006 "A European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy" [         COM(2006) 105        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      With this Green Paper the Commission maps out a genuine European energy policy to meet the numerous challenges in terms of supply and the impact on growth and the environment in Europe.

summary of   Communication (COM(2009) 346 final) on a harmonised methodology for classifying and reporting consumer complaints and enquiries   what is the aim of the communication   It sets out the benefits of harmonising the classifying and reporting of consumer  *  complaints  *  throughout the European Union (EU). These are considered a  key indicator  of whether the single market is working or not.   It recommends a harmonised voluntary  methodology  .   key points    The  harmonised methodology  is based on the following principles:   the  data should be comparable  with other data sets, such as consumer satisfaction, from the  consumer markets scoreboard  ;   it should be based on the UN’s  classification of individual consumption by purpose  ;   it should allow a  seamless transition  from existing classifications to the new harmonised model;    implementation costs  should be minimised and acceptable to consumer complaint bodies;   it can be  adapted  as markets evolve.     The  methodology  contains 3 sections:   general information about the complaint;   sectoral information about the complaint;   information about the type of complaint.     The communication was followed in 2010 by a  recommendation  from the  European Commission  on the use of the harmonised methodology for classifying and reporting consumer complaints and enquiries  *  .   The recommendation sets out:   the data that complaint handling bodies should collect and register;   the way the data should be processed and reported.     The Commission uses various methods to monitor markets and consumer conditions and behaviour. These include:    surveys of consumers’ and retailers’ attitudes to cross-border trade  used by the Commission to monitor the integration of the single market from the consumer’s point of view, as well as consumer conditions in EU countries; these surveys are used for preparing  consumer scoreboards  ;    consumer market monitoring surveys  which focus on the ease of comparing goods and services offered, consumers’ trust in retailers and suppliers, problems that consumers experience and consumer satisfaction. These are the basis for preparing the consumer scoreboards which  track the performance of more than 40 consumer goods and services markets  ;   detailed studies on specific consumer issues, (e.g. a  study  of the impact of marketing through social media, online games and mobile applications on children’s behaviour);   financial support to establish or improve IT systems used to send the  harmonised data on complaints  to the Commission.     The Consumer Complaints Expert Group is a network set up to assist the implementation of the Commission’s recommendation on the use of the harmonised methodology. The group advises on issues relating to the implementation of the methodology and on other issues that might arise in connection with the recommendation.   background    The value of harmonising complaint classifications at EU level is considerable, whether for EU and national regulators, consumer organisations or EU consumers themselves.   The data are directly comparable across the EU resulting in a faster and better-targeted response by authorities to consumers’ problems, based on this evidence, whether at EU or national level. The data collected enable national authorities and regulators to respond better to emerging trends, give a more complete picture of their markets, and allow easier comparisons with other countries.   For more information, see:    ‘Data on consumer complaints’  on the European Commission’s website.   * key terms     Consumer:  an individual person not acting in the course of their trade, business, craft or profession     Consumer complaint:  a statement of dissatisfaction with a specific trader by a consumer to a complaint handling body     Consumer enquiry:  a request for information or advice, other than a complaint, by a consumer to a complaint handling body
act   Directive 19  99/4/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 February 1999 relating to coffee extracts and chicory extracts (  See amending acts  ).   summary   This Directive simplifies the legislation - previously regulated by Directive  77/436/EEC  - relating to extracts of coffee and extracts of chicory. It is aimed at protecting the interests of consumers and producers by establishing rules on the description, definition and characteristics of these products.   Scope   The Directive covers the following products:   coffee extract and soluble coffee extract;   soluble or instant coffee (with the exception of café torrefacto soluble);   chicory extract;   soluble chicory;   instant chicory.   These products must comply with certain minimum composition requirements, in particular as regards the dry matter content.   Labelling   Coffee and chicory extracts must be labelled in accordance with the provisions of Directive  2000/13/EC  , which relates to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs. However, only the above-mentioned descriptions may be used in trade in these products, possibly accompanied by information concerning the form (paste, liquid, concentrated, etc.), any added substances, and the caffeine content. An indication of the minimum coffee- or chicory-based dry matter content as a percentage by weight of the finished product is also obligatory.   Other provisions   Trade in coffee or chicory extracts conforming to the provisions of this Directive may not be impeded by conflicting national provisions.  The Commission is to be assisted by the  standing committee on the food chain and animal health  in applying this Directive.

   European Social Fund support for the European Employment Strategy     European Social Fund support for the European Employment Strategy     This communication aligns the priorities of the European Social Fund (ESF), a financial instrument used to promote regional cohesion, with those of the European Employment Strategy (EES). It explains how the financial instrument supports the four main objectives for the improvement of the labour market in the European Union and underpins the commitments made by the Member States in their National Action Plans for employment.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 16 January 2001 on European Social Fund support for the European Employment Strategy [       COM(2001) 16      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Regulation No       1784/1999      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 1999 redefined the priorities of the       ESF      proposed in       Agenda 2000      and introduced the ESF programmes for the period 2000-2006. This communication explains how these priorities must be integrated into the objectives of the European Employment Strategy (       EES      ).     It broadens the scope of the ESF, which ceases to be a training programme and becomes a strategic tool encompassing a wide range of measures for investment in human resources, acknowledged as the main driving force for economic growth. The ESF aims to coordinate national labour market policies in order to make them more effective and place the emphasis on job creation. The programmes focus on preventive measures, equal opportunities, social integration and access to information and communication technologies (ICT).     EUR 60 billion are allocated to the ESF for measures relating to the European Employment Strategy (EES) for the period 2000-2006.     The European Employment Strategy highlights four major areas: employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities. Under Objectives       1      and       3      , the ESF will support these areas in the following way:       Employability        : about 60% of the European Social Fund's budget (EUR 34 billion) will be devoted to improving employability throughout the European Union. One third of this sum, i.e. almost EUR 11 billion, is set aside for combating social exclusion.       Entrepreneurship: this will receive EUR 8 billion from the ESF, which will provide the necessary stimulus for new businesses and job creation in the services sector.        Adaptability        : almost EUR 11 billion will be invested in promoting the adaptability of Europe's working population, the main priorities being the development of continuing training, the use of ICT and activities for SMEs.        Equal opportunities        : on account of the mainstreaming of equal opportunities throughout the EES, it is not possible to state the precise sum set aside for this pillar. However, the budget allocated to specific measures amounts to some EUR 4 billion.      In order to facilitate flexibility with regard to national priorities, the distribution of appropriations between the four pillars shows significant variations from one Member State to another.     The communication also shows how the ESF supports the National Action Plans (NAPs) in order to provide a springboard into the labour market rather than a safety-net and to act as catalyst for national policies on equal opportunities.     The participation of the EU candidate countries in the EES is a major priority. It is a question of identifying the priority areas where progress has to be made and showing how the Phare programme can provide its financial support. This programme supports projects in the field of employment and human resources development under its main strand       Strengthening of institutional capacities      and the specific action Economic and social cohesion. The special programme of preparation for the Structural Funds gives the candidate countries the resources to manage efficiently the appropriations granted by the Structural Funds.     The Commission is also improving the implementation of each programme through appropriate monitoring and evaluation and taking more account of the regional and local dimensions. It also has to coordinate the investments of the ESF and the other Structural Funds and consult the social partners, NGOs and other interested parties.     For the figures on ESF assistance between 2000 and 2006 and the country fiches, please consult the annexes to this communication, which also shows the measures taken between 1994 and 1999 and the ESF commitments for 2000-2006.     The publication of the Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities entitled The       European Social Fund in action 2000-2006      presents the success stories supported by the ESF in the fields of active labour market measures, social inclusion, lifelong learning, adaptability and the participation of women.

   Development of e-Procurement in the European Union (Green Paper)     Development of e-Procurement in the European Union (Green Paper)     The Commission's research suggests that less than 5% of procurement budgets in the Member States are awarded through electronic systems. In the context of promoting e-government, the Commission wishes to encourage e-Procurement. This Green Paper thus forms a first step towards an examination of existing EU provisions on public procurement. It is to be followed by a second Green Paper on the modernisation of these provisions.     ACT     Green Paper from the European Commission of 18 October 2010 on expanding the use of e-Procurement in the EU [       COM(2010) 571      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This Green Paper launches a consultation on       e-Procurement      .      Aim of the Green Paper      The objective of the consultation launched by this Green Paper is to encourage the dematerialisation of procedures for the awarding of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts. This includes replacing       paper-based procedures by electronic procedures      for all or a certain amount of the communications and transactions.     This computerisation process should include the following stages:      publication of tender notices;       provision of tender documents;       submission of tenders;       evaluation;       award;       ordering;       invoicing;       payment.       Benefits of e-Procurement procedures      The European Commission considers that e-Procurement procedures will enable:      accessibility and market transparency to be strengthened;       administrative costs to be reduced;       purchasing procedures to be reviewed and rationalised;       the potential for integration of European Union (EU) procurement markets to be improved.       Existing initiatives facilitating e-procurement procedures      Directives       2004/17/EC      and       2004/18/EC      have already been amended to facilitate electronic processing in public procurement, and the adoption of appropriate techniques and tools.     In 2004, the European Commission conceived an       Action Plan for e-Procurement      . This Action Plan assisted Member States in transposing the new legal framework, in particular through an interpretative document and studies aimed at identifying the functional requirements to be applied and explaining the new concepts. In addition, the Action Plan promoted the creation of a common infrastructure for the electronic publication of tender notices, “TED” (       Tenders Electronic Daily)      and a Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV) in all official languages of the Union.     The European Commission has also put in place the following practical tools:        PEPPOL         : a cross-border pilot project the aim of which is to offer standards-based infrastructure and services at European level, based on the exchange of structured documents between suppliers and buyers (e-Catalogues, e-Ordering and e-Invoicing);         e-CERTIS         : an online information tool which provides information on the different certificates and attestations frequently requested in procurement procedures;         Open e-PRIOR         : a European Commission platform enabling e-Ordering and e-Invoicing to be used.       Barriers to be overcome      Most obstacles hindering e-Procurement are interrelated. Comprehensive action should therefore be conducted in order to combat:      the         lack of motivation        on the part of contracting authorities and suppliers due to the cost of reorganising their internal systems;       the         lack of standards        in e-Procurement processes;       the         lack of means        to facilitate mutual recognition of national electronic solutions;       the         cost of        bidder identification         techniques        ;       the         different speeds        of Member States’ transitions to e-Procurement.       The role of the EU in promoting e-Procurement      The EU must respect the       decentralised nature of procurement procedures      . At national or regional level, contracting authorities have the choice as to whether to use electronic or other communication methods for procurement above the thresholds laid down by European procurement directives.     The EU may act at different levels to encourage e-Procurement:       facilitating the accessibility of procurement, in particular cross-border participation        , by proposing an appropriate and flexible legal framework;        accelerating take-up        of e-Procurement by helping Member States to introduce certain obligations either generally or for designated purchases;        participate in putting in place building blocks for standardised and interoperable        e-Procurement infrastructure;        promoting the exchange of best practice        in benchmarking and monitoring;        developing co-operation initiatives at international level.        The Commission has already been working on the         Agreement on Government Procurement        (GPA), and with the         United Nations Commission on International Trade Law        (UNCITRAL).       Consultation deadline      The Commission invites all parties involved in developing e-Procurement in Europe to reply to this consultation by       31 January 2011      .

act   Directive  2002/59/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2002 establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system and repealing Council Directive 93/75/EEC.   summary   This European Union (EU) law sets up a vessel traffic monitoring and information exchange system. This seeks to enhance  maritime safety  ,  port and maritime security  ,  environmental protection  and pollution preparedness. It also permits the exchange and sharing of additional information facilitating efficient maritime traffic and transport.   what does the directive do  It sets up a system to monitor Europe’s waters and coasts - maritime surveillance and situational awareness (ship positions) - supporting EU countries in their operational tasks.  To improve situational awareness in the maritime domain and to provide tailor-made solutions to authorities, the law was amended by Commission Directive  2014/100/EU  . This allows for the information gathered and exchanged using the EU’s maritime information and exchange system (  SafeSeaNet  (SSN)) to be integrated with data from the EU’s other monitoring and tracking systems, such as  CleanSeaNet  , and from external systems (e.g. satellite automatic identification systems (AISs)).  It lays down the responsibilities of EU countries, maritime authorities, shippers, shipping operators and masters of ships.   key points   All ships of 300 gross tonnes and upwards are covered, whether or not they carry dangerous goods, except for:        —     warships;            —     fishing vessels, traditional ships and recreational craft less than 45 metres in length;            —     bunkers below 1 000 tonnes.       Requirements on operators of ships bound for EU ports   They must notify certain information (ship identification, total number of persons on board, port of destination, estimated time of arrival, etc.) to the maritime  national single window  (since 1 June 2015).   Equipment and installations   Ships calling at a port of an EU country must be fitted with:        —     an automatic identification system; and            —     a voyage data recorder (VDR) system (‘black box’) to facilitate investigations following accidents;            —     EU and European Economic Area (EEA) countries must have AIS receivers and must link the national single windows/national SSN with the central SSN system.       Dangerous or polluting goods onboard ships         —     prior to taking such goods on board, shippers must declare these to the operator;            —     the operator, agent or master of a ship must also notify general information, such as the ship identification and the information provided by the shipper, to the competent authority.       Monitoring of hazardous ships and intervention in the event of incidents and accidents   Authorities must inform the EU countries concerned if they are notified of ships that have:        —     previously been involved in incidents or accidents at sea;            —     failed to comply with notification and reporting requirements;            —     deliberately discharged pollutants; or            —     been refused access to ports.      The  master of a ship  must immediately report:        —     any incident or accident affecting the safety of the ship;            —     any incident or accident compromising shipping safety;            —     any situation liable to lead to pollution of the waters or shore of an EU country;            —     any slick of polluting materials and containers or packages seen drifting at sea.       Places of refuge   All EU/EEA countries have to draw up plans to accommodate ships in need of assistance in places of refuge. They must also meet regularly to exchange experience and take joint improvement measures.   Compliance   EU countries must check the operation of their information systems and introduce a system of financial penalties to act as a deterrent against failure to comply with the directive’s requirements.   Management   The system is developed and managed by the European Commission and the EU/EEA countries. The  European Maritime Safety Agency  is responsible for its technical operation.   background   This directive is an integral part of the EU’s maritime safety policy. Besides their role in maintaining safety, security and sustainability, the system and platform are central to creating a single European maritime area without barriers - the  European Maritime Transport Space  .

   Europe's response to world ageing     Europe's response to world ageing     The European Union contributes to the work of preparing a new international plan of action on ageing. It underlines the need to adopt a global policy to respond to the challenge which population ageing presents at world level.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 18 March 2002, entitled "Europe's response to World Ageing. Promoting economic and social progress in an ageing world. A contribution of the European Commission to the Second World Assembly on Ageing" [       COM(2002) 143      final - Not published in the Official Journal]     SUMMARY     The European Union considers that the adoption of a new international plan of action on ageing provides an opportunity to improve international cooperation and to prepare a long-term global strategy for a society for all ages.      Ageing of the world population      Various factors explain the ageing of the world population, such as increased life expectancy and falling fertility rates, chiefly linked to progress in birth control, the baby boom and migration movements.     While today ageing seems to be a universal trend, its intensity varies, notably depending on the regions. Hence the developed countries already have a large number of older people and the trend is constantly growing. The developing countries are still at the first stage of the process, but the rate of population ageing is likely to accelerate quite rapidly.     Ageing affects the economic and social foundations of societies. Consequently, new challenges must be addressed to provide a framework which is adapted to persons of all ages, men and women.      The Community approach      A European dimension was given to the debate on population ageing by the Communication "       Towards a Europe for all ages      " of 1999. The Union now proposes sharing its experience with the other countries, notably the developing countries.     The Union has insisted on the need for a global policy approach, combining the aspects of ageing linked to the economy, employment and social questions. The challenges calling for particular attention have been identified:      managing the economic implications of ageing in order to maintain growth and sound public finances;       adjusting well to an ageing and shrinking workforce, notably by encouraging active ageing and by changing existing practices of age management in workplaces and labour markets;       ensuring adequate and financially sustainable pensions which are adaptable to variable conditions, so that older people are not threatened by poverty;       securing access of all to high quality health care while ensuring the financial sustainability of health services, with a view to ensuring healthy ageing and wellbeing over the life course.       The Union's suggestions for an international plan on ageing      The Union does not call for the transposition of its policy to other countries, since the context of ageing varies from one region to another as a function of the socio-economic and cultural background. This leads to a genuine diversity of challenges. However, the Union is convinced of the usefulness of international cooperation so that countries can learn and profit from each other's experience. Hence it supports the preparation of a long-term strategy at global level but proposes distinguishing between objectives applicable to all countries and those that are suited to particular regions of the world. The development of an information base would help reinforce this international cooperation.     It seems essential to secure a sufficient labour force to provide for a growing population of retired people, to manage the cost implications for public sector finances and the economy at large and to prevent poverty in old age.     Besides, the Union draws attention to the need for greater global awareness as regards ageing. In order to successfully adapt to population ageing, a holistic view of ageing is called for because it is a phenomenon which concerns the entire life cycle, society as a whole and all aspects of economic and social life. It is also important to ensure the good health and wellbeing of older people. Notably, this means encouraging a learning process on healthy lifestyles, preventing dependency and invalidity of older people, assisting families with elderly dependents via formal care arrangements, and addressing considerations about the end of life.      Context      The United Nations has been drawing attention to the ageing of the world population since 1982, when it organised the first conference on this subject and adopted on this occasion an international plan of action on ageing. Subsequently, 1999 was declared the International Year of Older Persons and a Second World Assembly on Ageing was organised in April 2002 with a view to adopting a new international plan of action on ageing.     Initially only the most developed countries considered ageing to be a problem. But the ageing process now affects an increasing number of developing regions and hence has assumed a global dimension. It is thus essential to ensure better global awareness of the challenge which ageing presents today.     RELATED ACTS      Result of the Second World Assembly on Ageing (2002 - Madrid)      In their political declaration the governments undertook to take both national and international measures concerning older persons and development, the advancement of health and wellbeing into old age, and the creation of enabling and supportive environments.     The International Plan of Action on Ageing 2002 analyses these three priorities and lays down the objectives and recommendations. The plan of action focuses on the promotion of health and wellbeing of older persons (health promotion and wellbeing throughout life, universal and equal access to health care, possibilities in the field of geriatrics and gerontology, neglect, abuse and violence, etc.). The United Nations will assist countries in implementing and following up the plan of action.

summary of   Revised Framework Agreement between European social partners on parental leave – Council Directive 2010/18/EU   summary    what does this directive do        —     It implements the revised Framework Agreement on parental leave concluded by the  European social partners  on 18 June 2009.      key points         —     Workers are entitled to  parental leave on the birth or adoption of a child  . Such leave may be taken until the child has reached an age determined by national law and/or collective agreements, but before the age of 8.            —     This Directive applies equally  to all workers, men and women,  irrespective of their type of employment contract (open-ended, fixed-term, part-time or temporary).            —     Parental leave must be granted for  at least a period of 4 months  as an individual right of both parents. In principle, workers should be able to take all of their leave. It should therefore not be transferable from one parent to the other. However, such transfers may be authorised on condition that each parent retains at least one of the 4 months of leave with a view to encourage a more equal uptake of parental leave by both parents. The Directive sets minimum standards, so that EU countries may apply or introduce more favourable provisions.       Taking of leave         —     The  conditions of access to leave and the circumstances for taking leave  are defined by national law and/or collective agreements. For example, EU countries and/or social partners may:        —     provide for the granting of leave on a full-time or part-time basis, in a piecemeal way or in the form of a time-credit system, taking into account both employers' and workers' needs;             —     make the right to parental leave subject to a  length of service qualification  which shall not exceed 1 year. Where applicable, that period shall be calculated taking account of all the successive fixed-term contracts concluded with the same employer;             —     define the circumstances under which the employer is authorised to  postpone leave  for justifiable reasons related to the operation of the organisation;             —     authorise  special arrangements  to ensure the proper operation of small undertakings.                 —     Workers wishing to take parental leave must  give notice to the employer  . The period of notice shall be specified in each EU country taking into account the interests of both workers and employers.            —     The Directive also encourages EU countries and/or social partners to define additional measures and/or the specific conditions for the taking of leave by  adoptive parents  and  parents of children with a disability or a long-term illness  .       Return to work and non-discrimination         —     After taking parental leave, workers shall have the right to  return to the same job  . If that is not possible, the employer must provide them with an equivalent or similar job consistent with their employment contract or employment relationship.            —     In addition,  rights acquired  or in the process of being acquired by the worker on the date on which parental leave starts:        —     must be maintained as they stand until the end of the leave;             —     must apply at the end of the leave, as must all changes arising from national law, collective agreements and/or practice.                 —     Similarly, workers must be protected  against less favourable treatment or dismissal  on the grounds of an application for, or the taking of, parental leave.            —     EU countries and/or the national social partners decide on all matters regarding  social security  and  income  in relation to parental leave. The Agreement does not therefore contain rules on the payment of salary or compensation during parental leave.            —     Lastly, on their return from leave, workers must be able to request  changes to their working hours and/or patterns  for a set period of time. Employers have to consider and respond to such requests, taking into account both employers’ and workers’ needs.       Leave on grounds of ‘force majeure’  (unforeseeable circumstances)        —     Workers may also request leave on grounds of  force majeure  for family reasons. Such leave may be requested in particular in cases of sickness or accident making the immediate presence of the worker within the family indispensable.      from when does the directive apply  It entered in to force on 7 April 2010. EU countries had to incorporate it in national law by 8 March 2012.   background   This Agreement follows the Framework Agreement of 14 December 1995 on parental leave, which was given legal effect by Council Directive 96/34/EC.  It represents a means of better reconciling workers’  professional and parental responsibilities  and of promoting  equal treatment between men and women  .  It is implemented, in accordance with  Article 155(2)  of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, by a Council Directive.        —      Parental leave: revised Framework Agreement       act   Council Directive  2010/18/EU  of 8 March 2010 implementing the revised Framework Agreement on parental leave concluded by BUSINESSEUROPE, UEAPME, CEEP and ETUC and repealing Directive 96/34/EC (OJ L 68, 18.3.2010, pp. 13–20)  Successive amendments and corrections to Directive 2010/18/EU have been incorporated into the basic text.

summary of   Decision 2011/265/EU — signing and provisionally applying the free trade agreement between the EU and EU countries of the one part, and South Korea, of the other    Free trade agreement between the EU and the EU countries, of the one part, and South Korea, of the other part   what is the aim of the decision and the free trade agreement   The decision marks the signing and provisional application, on behalf of the European Union (EU) of a free trade agreement (FTA) with South Korea.   Under the FTA, the partners — the EU and the EU countries, on the one hand, and Korea, on the other — aim to progressively eliminate or reduce duties and import quotas on imports and exports of industrial goods as well as agricultural and fisheries products.   The FTA also introduces progressive liberalisation of trade in services between the partners, as well as easing trade in a number of other areas.   key points    Objectives   The main objectives of this FTA are to:   eliminate duties for EU exporters of industrial and agricultural products;   improve market access for EU service providers;   abolish non-tariff barriers (i.e. barriers other than tariffs such as quotas or technical standards), in particular in the electronics, pharmaceuticals and medical devices sectors;   improve market access for EU car manufacturers;   further liberalise government procurement (i.e. ensuring that EU and South Korean suppliers can compete on equal terms in one another’s government purchasing markets);   protect intellectual property rights;   promote competition;   improve transparency;   integrate  sustainable development  within the trade relationship;   establish a rapid and effective dispute settlement system.    Elimination of tariff and non-tariff measures    The EU and Korea agree to  progressively abolish customs duties  applying to their trade in goods (within 5 years of the FTA’s entry into force). This liberalisation applies to over 98% of goods (listed in Annex 2-A).   There are longer transition periods (7 years or more) for the elimination of duties for certain sensitive farm or fishery products.   In certain circumstances, one party may apply  bilateral safeguard measures  where an increase in imports causes or threatens to cause serious damage (e.g. loss of market share or reduced prices) to the relevant sector in their own economy.   On  technical barriers to trade (TBTs)  , the EU and Korea agree to cooperate on standards and regulations, opening discussions when appropriate.    Sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures  may be introduced in order to protect human, animal or plant life or health. However, the partners agree to minimise the effects of these measures on the development of trade.    Trade in services, establishment and e-commerce    The partners agree to liberalise part of their offer of services in accordance with the WTO’s  General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS)  . They have therefore drawn up a list of commitments and limitations (Annex 7-A) concerning the  liberalised service sectors  .   The agreement defines the rules on the  right of establishment  for access to the market in services, and on the  right of residence  for professionals.   The partners recognise that  e-commerce  contributes to economic growth and barriers to its use and development must be avoided. However, its development must be fully compatible with international data protection standards.   The parties agree to open their  financial services  sectors to one another.    Government procurement    The EU and Korea agree to give each other access to their markets in products and services, in compliance with the rules on openness, transparency and non-discrimination in the WTO’s  Agreement on Government Procurement  .   The rules applying to  public works contracts  are laid down in Annex 9 to the agreement.    Intellectual property   This chapter includes the parties’ commitments with regard to intellectual property rights (IPRs) and in  particular trademarks, copyright, designs  and  geographical indications  . These complement and update the WTO  Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement  . The chapter also includes a section on enforcement of IPRs based on the EU’s internal rules contained in the  enforcement directive  .   Dispute settlement   In the event of non-compliance with the FTA, there is a dispute settlement mechanism similar to that of the WTO. The FTA dispute settlement involves  consultation  and  arbitration  , and there is a mediation mechanism.   Sustainable development    The EU and South Korea are committed to implementing the conventions and standards of the  International Labour Organization   ratified by the parties  , as well as the  multilateral environmental agreements  they have signed.   The partners agree to set up  institutional structures  to implement and monitor their joint commitments and mechanisms for cooperation on trade and sustainable development.    Amendment of the agreement   In 2014, the agreement was amended to take account of Croatia’s joining the EU in July 2013. Croatia now benefits from the same conditions as other EU countries.   Evaluation process   In 2016, the  European Commission  published the  terms of reference  for an  evaluation of the impact  of implementing the FTA. Experience in implementing this FTA may in the future serve as a basis for improving the design of similar agreements being negotiated with other countries.   from when does the agreement apply   The FTA has been provisionally applied since July 2011 and formally entered into force on 13 December 2015.   The additional protocol to the FTA to take account of Croatia’s joining the EU entered into force on 1 January 2016.   background    According to a 2010  study  , this agreement should allow bilateral trade to double over the next 20 years compared to a situation without an agreement in place.

summary of   Regulation (EU) No 1214/2011 — rules on the professional cross-border transport of euro cash by road between euro-area countries   what is the aim of this regulation  The aim is twofold:   to ensure a more level-playing field for cash-intransit (CIT) companies providing transportation of euro cash by road in the  euro area  ;   to ensure that the professional transport of euro cash by road between countries belonging to the euro area is competitive, secure and safe for both the staff concerned and the general public.   key points    Rationale and scope   The introduction of the euro has increased the need for the cross-border transport of cash by road in euro area countries. Banks, the retail sector and other professional cash handlers should be able to contract with CIT companies offering the best price and/or service. They should also be entitled to take advantage of the cash services of the nearest national central bank branch or CIT cash centre, even if it is located in another euro-area country. Euro-area countries (‘participating countries’) also have the right to arrange for euro banknotes and coins to be produced abroad. Retailers and banks located in border areas may wish to obtain their supplies from the cash centre nearest to them, which is not necessarily in the same EU country. The very principle of a single currency implies the freedom to move cash between participating euro-area countries.  A full harmonisation of CIT transport in participating EU countries was not considered feasible, nor was a system considered appropriate where authorisation in one EU country would be valid in all EU countries (‘mutual recognition’). Therefore, Regulation (EU) No 1214/2011 lays down a set of common rules valid in all EU countries, without prejudice to national rules for certain aspects explicitly indicated in the regulation. It does not involve full harmonisation, as the common rules only apply to cross-border transport.   Cross-border CIT licence   Given the potential threats, associated with the activity of transporting cash, to the security of the staff of CIT companies and the general public, the cross-border transport of euro cash is subject to holding a specific cross-border CIT licence. National authorities grant this licence for a period of 5 years if CIT companies meet certain conditions, such as requirements for security staff or for vehicles.  The CIT licences are registered in the EU’s  Internal Market Information System  to allow public authorities to easily access them.  Staff carrying out cross-border CIT are entitled to the minimum rates of pay that apply in the host countries.   Cross-border transport of euro cash   The cross-border CIT licence grants the holder the right to transport euro banknotes and coins across borders by road, during daylight hours and only if both the majority of the pick-up or of the delivery is in the host country and the value of euro cash is at least 80 % of the total cash value transported in the vehicle. Some specific transport arrangements are explicitly exempted from the scope of the regulation, such as point-to-point transports to and from national central banks or cash production sites.   Transport arrangements   The regulation provides for 5 types of transport arrangements for euro banknotes and 2 types for euro coins. It defines the conditions of each, such as:   vehicle armouring;   the use of intelligent banknote neutralisation systems (IBNS);   the presence of CIT security staff.   The participating countries decide which transport arrangements apply in their territory.   Role of IBNS and removal of neutralised banknotes   The regulation seeks to facilitate the use of IBNS so as to improve the security of CIT security staff and the public. CIT companies must remove neutralised banknotes (banknotes rendered unusable to protect them against unauthorised access) from circulation so that they are no longer used for payment.   Host country rules applying to transport: national police force, public security and carrying of firearms   CIT aspects not covered by the common rules of the regulation are governed by national law, subject to the general rules of the treaty (such as the  principle of non-discrimination  ), and must be respected in the host country by the CIT company carrying out the cross-border transport. These national rules concern:   the role of the police force (such as prior notification, escorting or distant remote tracking);   security rules on cash delivery or pick-up at locations; and   rules on firearms.    Notification and information     Licence holders  must inform the participating country of the intended start of cross-border transport.    Participating countries  must inform each other of cross-border business notified by the CIT companies.   On the Europa website, the  European Commission  publishes all information on:   IBNS approved by participating countries;    national rules on the role of police forces and on the security of locations where the cash is delivered or picked up from  ;    national CIT training requirements  ;   the  credentials of the national granting authority;  and   the  host administration  that has to be notified about the start of cross-border transport.     The  Commission  publishes the applicable transport arrangements as chosen by the participating countries in the  Official Journal of the European Union  .    Compliance checks, penalties and emergency security measures   Participating countries carry out compliance checks on CIT companies acting in their territory. Penalties can be applied in cases of non-compliance.  Competent authorities may introduce  temporary security measures  in the event of an urgent problem significantly affecting the security of CIT operations.   Review   Every 5 years, the Commission  reports  to the  European Parliament  and the  Council  on the regulation’s implementation.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 29 November 2012.   background   For more information, see:    Common EU rules for professional cross-border transportation of euro cash by road  (  European Commission  ).
act   Regulation (EU) No  1052/2013  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2013 establishing the European border surveillance system (Eurosur).   summary   In October 2013, the EU adopted a regulation establishing the European border surveillance system (Eurosur).   Multi-purpose system   Eurosur is a multi-purpose system to prevent illegal immigration and cross-border crime at the external borders. It will also contribute to ensuring the protection and saving the lives of migrants trying to reach European shores.  It provides a mechanism allowing border surveillance agencies to rapidly exchange information and work together. By means of national coordination centres, all EU countries’ national authorities responsible for border surveillance (e.g. border guards, police, coastguard, navy, etc.) must coordinate their activities with those of other EU countries and the EU border agency, Frontex.   Faster responses thanks to better information   Eurosur follows an intelligence-driven approach, allowing national and EU agencies to better understand what is happening at external borders and to respond faster to new routes and methods used by criminal networks.   Rapid reaction capability   Eurosur enables EU countries to react faster not only to single incidents, but also to critical situations occurring at EU external borders. For this purpose, the external land and sea borders have been divided into ‘border sections’ and they have each been assigned a low, medium or high ‘impact level’. This allows hotspots at the external borders to be identified, with a standardised reaction at national level and at EU level, if required.   Fundamental rights   EU countries that have signed the  Schengen Agreement  and Frontex must fully respect fundamental rights, in particular the  non-refoulement  principle (which forbids a true victim of persecution being returned to their persecutor) and personal data protection.   Entry into force   As of December 2013, Eurosur was operational in the 19 EU countries that signed the Schengen Agreement that have southern and eastern external borders. The remaining 11 Schengen countries joined Eurosur on 1 December 2014.  Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom (   1   ) did not take part in the adoption of this regulation. However, it was agreed that Ireland and the United Kingdom (   1   ) could cooperate with Eurosur by means of regional networks. Denmark has since decided to participate in Eurosur.

   Training aid     Training aid     The Commission exempts from the notification requirement certain training aid that is compatible with the competition rules.     ACT     Commission Regulation (EC) No       68/2001      of 12 January 2001 on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to training aid [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY      Scope      The Regulation applies to aid granted by a Member State to a company for training purposes. The training may be in any field. It is defined as specific where it is principally applicable principally to the employee's present or future position and general where it provides qualifications that are largely transferable to other firms or fields of work. The risks of distortive effects on competition are higher in the first case than in the second.      Conditions for exemption      Training aid is exempt from the notification requirement, provided that the aid intensity does not exceed a certain percentage of the project's overall cost. So, for a project involving:      specific training, the aid intensity may not exceed 25% for large firms and 35% for         small or medium-sized enterprises        (SMEs);       general training, the aid intensity may not exceed 50% for large firms and 70% for SMEs;       both specific and general training, the aid intensity may not exceed 25% for large firms and 35% for SMEs.      In certain cases, the aid intensity may be increased by:      5 percentage points for firms in areas which qualify for regional aid;       10 percentage points for firms in areas where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment;       10 percentage points if the training is given to disadvantaged workers;       100 percentage points for aid granted in the maritime transport sector, provided that the trainee is not an active member of the crew and that the training is carried out on board ships.      The eligible costs of a training project are:      trainers' remuneration;       trainers' travel expenses;       trainees' expenses;       expenses on materials and supplies;       depreciation of tools and equipment;       costs of guidance and counselling services;       trainees' remuneration.      Where training aid meets the criteria for exemption from notification, mention must be made of this Regulation.     Exemption does not apply to individual training projects with a budget of more than 1 million. Exempted aid may not be cumulated with other state aid. The percentages allowed cover all aid, whether financed entirely by the State or partly financed by the Community.      Transparency and monitoring      To ensure appropriate transparency and monitoring, the Commission requires Member States:      to forward it to a summary of the information on an aid scheme within twenty days of its implementation (Annex II);       to keep detailed records on aid schemes exempted by the Regulation;       to compile an annual report on the application of the Regulation (Annex III).       Background       Regulation 994/98      empowers the Commission to exempt certain categories of state aid. In this context, Regulation 68/2001 exempts all training aid that meets certain conditions. Such exemption is justified in that training has positive effects in terms of raising vocational qualifications and increasing the competitiveness of European industry.     Regulation (EC) No       68/2001      , initially scheduled to expire on 31 December 2006, was extended a first time until 31 December 2007 by Regulation (EC) No       1040/2006      , then a second time until 30 June 2008 by Regulation (EC) No       1976/2006      .

   Green Paper on Copyright in the Knowledge Economy     Green Paper on Copyright in the Knowledge Economy     This Green Paper aims at organising a debate concerning online access to all types of works whilst preserving copyright.     ACT     European Commission Green Paper of 16 July 2008 on Copyright in the Knowledge Economy [       COM(2008) 466 final      – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Copyright is at the heart of debates concerning the online dissemination of knowledge for research, science or education.     This Green Paper deals firstly with the exceptions and limitations to exclusive rights permitted in       Directive 2001/29/EC      and       Directive 96/9/EC      , and secondly with the particular issues related to the exceptions and limitations which are most relevant for the dissemination of knowledge and whether these exceptions should evolve in the era of digital dissemination.      Purpose      The Green Paper focuses on how research, scientific and educational materials are disseminated to the public, and also on all types of material having a value in enhancing knowledge with a view to strengthening the free movement of knowledge and innovation – the “Fifth Freedom” – in the internal market.     The public addressed by the Green Paper comprises scientists, researchers, students, disabled people or the general public, more specifically any person who wishes to acquire knowledge by using the Internet.     The European Commission considers that wider dissemination of knowledge contributes to more inclusive and cohesive societies, in line with the renewed Social Agenda.      General issues      Directive 2001/29/EC has harmonised the right of reproduction, the right of communication to the public, the right of making available to the public and the distribution right. Whereas, with regard to exceptions, although the Directive has established a full list of exceptions to copyright protection, the list includes one obligatory exception and twenty optional exceptions thus leaving a large amount of freedom to Member States.     The Community being a party to the World Trade Organisation Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), this text is applicable to the limitations on copyright.      Exceptions      Given the existence of directives and legislation dealing with copyright, this Green Paper aims to define the exceptions which have the most impact on the dissemination of knowledge.      Exceptions for libraries and archives      This Green Paper questions the scope of the exception for libraries and archives, the strengthening of access to works, the scanning of works and orphan works with a view to a possible amendment of the Directive on Copyright in the Information Society.      Exceptions for the benefit of people with a disability      People with a disability should be able to access works. This exception is not expressly provided for in Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases.     In this perspective, the Green Paper reflects on the efficiency of a licensing scheme by publishers in order to improve access to works, on the obligation of making works available in a particular form and the question of remuneration to recover the costs of formatting.      Dissemination for teaching and research purposes      The Green Paper asks questions about licensing schemes in order to improve access to works for teaching and research purposes, the modern forms of distance learning and the use of works at home for study.      User-created content      The user may also become the creator of content within the framework of new technologies. An exception could be envisaged for creators of content.      Context      Copyright in the knowledge economy represents a significant challenge, in that its environment is constantly changing. The priority is to protect authors’ copyright, whilst also facilitating access to their works for all. The Green Paper highlights the difficulty of reconciling these two objectives.

summary of   Decision 2003/93/EC on the 1996 Hague Convention relating to international legal aspects of parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children   what does this decision do   It authorises EU countries to sign the  Hague Convention  .   The convention lays down rules to improve protection for children in international situations and avoid conflicts between different national legal systems.   All EU countries are party to the Hague Convention. This means they can rely on common legal rules when dealing with countries outside the EU who are parties to the Convention, to protect children involved in international disputes.   key points    The Convention was concluded under the  Hague Conference on Private International Law  .   It covers  jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility  .    What is covered?   The convention seeks to give international protection to children of up to 18 years old, by establishing:   which country has jurisdiction to take measures to protect a child or their property;   which law is applicable for exercising this jurisdiction;   which law applies to parental responsibility;   that the protection measures are recognised and enforced in all signatory countries;   cooperation between signatory countries.   The measures aimed at protecting a child relate to:   parental responsibility;   custody rights;   guardianship;   how the child is represented;   placement of the child in foster or other care;   supervision of that care;   how the child’s property is managed.    Which country is responsible?   The country with jurisdiction to provide protection measures is generally the  country where the child is usually resident  .  It is the  country where they are present  :   for refugees or internationally displaced children;   for children whose usual country of residence cannot be established;   in emergencies (optional).    Exception   In a particular case, if another country appears to be better placed for assessing the best interests of the child, it may be allowed to assume jurisdiction.   Which law applies?    The country exercising jurisdiction does so under its own law.   Exceptionally, it may apply or take into consideration the law of another country that is closely connected to the situation – if this is in the best interest of the child.   A country can only refuse to apply the law designated by the convention for justified reasons of public policy and in the best interest of the child.    Recognition & enforcement    The measures a signatory country takes under this convention to protect a child or their property must be recognised in all other signatory countries.   Only in a limited number of cases, as specified in the convention, may a country refuse recognition.   When protection measures are declared enforceable in another country, that country must enforce them as if it had taken them itself, and do so in accordance with its own law.    Cooperation    Each signatory country must designate one or more central authorities to carry out the obligations imposed on it by the convention.   These authorities must cooperate and exchange information with each other, as well as promote cooperation in such cases among their national authorities.   background    Protecting children’s rights – EU information   act   Council Decision  2003/93/EC  of 19 December 2002 authorising the Member States, in the interest of the Community, to sign the 1996 Hague Convention on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition, enforcement and cooperation in respect of parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children (OJ L 48, 21.2.2003, pp. 1–2)
act   Directive  1999/62/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 1999 on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures.   summary    what does the directive do  It replaces earlier legislation - Directive 93/89/EEC - which had been annulled by the European Court of Justice in 1995. It harmonises the conditions under which national authorities may apply taxes, tolls and user charges on goods carried by road.   key points    Financial charges initially only applied to vehicles with a maximum gross laden weight of 12 tonnes. From 2012, this was extended to vehicles over 3.5 tonnes.   They may be levied on motorways, bridges, tunnels, mountain passes and certain other categories of roads.   Charges may not discriminate between the haulier’s nationality or the vehicle’s origin or destination.   Mandatory controls at internal EU borders are forbidden.   Charges may vary depending on emissions produced or the time the road infrastructure is used.   National authorities may levy other taxes in specific circumstances, such as registration, abnormal loads and parking or to avoid congestion.   Charges do not apply to vehicles registered in the Canaries, Ceuta and Melilla, the Azores or Madeira operating in those territories or between them and Spain and Portugal.    Directive 2003/96/EC  sets minimum tax levels for all motor fuels. Countries with road user charges may apply a reduced rate for gas oil used by those vehicles.   when does the directive apply  From 20 July 1999.   background   In 2014, the Commission adopted a  strategy  to reduce fuel consumption and CO  2  emissions from transport. This emphasised the contributions new technology, including alternative fuels, and a shift to other forms of transport could make.

Institutional support    A  Cooperation Council  which oversees the agreement’s implementation meets regularly at ministerial level.    Interregional Association    The agreement sets up regular political dialogue to advance progress towards an Interregional Association.   In June 2019,  political agreement  was reached on Association Agreement between the parties.   date of entry into force   The agreement entered into force on 1 July 1999 and is valid indefinitely.   background   For more information see:    EU and Mercosur  (  European External Action Service  ).   main documents   Council Decision  1999/279/EC  of 22 March 1999 concerning the conclusion, on behalf of the European Community, of the interregional framework cooperation agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Southern Common Market and its Party States, of the other part (OJ L 112, 29.4.1999, pp. 65-84)   Interregional Framework Cooperation Agreement  between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Southern Common Market and its Party States, of the other part — Joint Declaration on political dialogue between the European Union and Mercosur (OJ L 69, 19.3.1996, pp. 4-22)   Corrigendum  to the Interregional Framework Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Southern Common Market and its Party States, of the other part (OJ L 61, 10.3.1999, p. 55)
summary of   Regulation (EC) No 1610/96 — supplementary protection certificate for plant protection products    Regulation (EC) No 469/2009 — supplementary protection certificate for pharmaceutical products   what is the aim of these regulations   They provide additional protection for specific patented pharmaceutical and plant protection products that have been approved for sale.   Amending Regulation (EU)  2019/933  introduced a  manufacturing waiver  to the protection given by a  supplementary protection certificate (SPC)   *  for pharmaceutical products that allows EU-based companies to manufacture a generic or similar version of an SPC-protected medicine during the term of the certificate:   either for exporting to a non-EU market; or   for stockpiling during the final 6 months of an SPC, ahead of entry into the EU market.     This European Union protection is designed to even out any disparities and shortcomings in national pharmaceutical and plant protection product patent systems.   key points    Any pharmaceutical or plant protection product may receive an SPC, where:   it is protected by a national patent (the  basic patent  );   it must have national or EU authorisation before it may be sold (marketing authorisation); and   it does not already have a certificate.     The SPC confers the same rights as those provided by the basic patent, apart from the limitations of the manufacturing waiver explained above.   The SPC application must be lodged with the relevant national industrial property office:   within 6 months of the marketing authorisation being granted; or   where the marketing authorisation is granted before the basic patent is granted, within 6 months of the date on which the patent is granted.     The SPC takes effect when the basic patent expires, and is valid for up to 5 years. The overall protection a patent and an SPC can provide may not be more than 15 years from the granting of the first marketing authorisation.   The SPC may be extended once for 6 months for pharmaceutical products for children where a   paediatric investigation plan   has been prepared. The overall protection provided is then 15,5 years.   from when do the regulations apply   Regulation (EC) No 1610/96 has applied since 8 February 1997, except in those countries whose national law did not cover the patentability of plant protection products, where it has applied since 2 January 1998.   Regulation (EC) No 469/2009  codifies  Council Regulation (EEC) No  1768/92  . It has applied since 6 July 2009.   Amending Regulation (EU) 2019/933 has applied since 1 July 2019.   background    The time between applying for a patent for a new pharmaceutical or plant protection product and receiving authorisation to place it on the market reduces the effective period of patent protection. The SPC aims to offset that reduction in the effective patent protection in these fields of research to encourage innovation and prevent these industries moving away from EU countries.

   European Union Strategy for the Danube Region     European Union Strategy for the Danube Region     SUMMARY OF:      Communication on a European Union Strategy for Danube Region       Staff working document – Action Plan accompanying the European Union Strategy for Danube Region      WHAT ARE THE AIMS OF THE COMMUNICATION AND ACTION PLAN?      The         EU Strategy for the Danube Region (EUSDR)        is a         macro-regional strategy         *        jointly developed by the Danube Region countries and stakeholders and the         European Commission        , designed to deal with major common challenges. It aims to create synergies and coordinate existing policies and initiatives across the Danube Region.       The 2020 EUSDR Action Plan is the integrated response to these common challenges. It updates and concentrates the 2010 actions, putting them into a strategic background, including the         European Green Deal        and the digital transition, and provides links to connect the actions with other programmes.      KEY POINTS     The Danube Region is an area defined by its river basin, largely in       European Union      (EU) territory. Geographically, it refers to: Germany (Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria), Austria, Slovakia, Czechia, Hungary, Slovenia, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Moldova and Ukraine (the regions along the Danube).      Challenges      The strategy deals with major challenges, in particular:       mobility        : exploiting the significant environmental and efficiency benefits of inland waterways, including multi-modal transportation, better interconnection with other river basins and modernising inland ports;        energy        : greater diversity will increase energy security, while improved efficiency, including energy saving and more renewable sources, is crucial;        environment        : the Danube is highly polluted and the impact of transport links, tourist developments, and new energy-producing facilities must be considered;        risks        : major flooding, droughts, and industrial pollution events are frequent – prevention, preparedness and effective response require close cooperation and information-sharing;        socio-economic        : the region has very wide economic disparity, with a lack of cooperation, both financially and institutionally;        security, serious and organised crime        : there are significant problems, including human trafficking and smuggling, while corruption undermines public confidence and hampers development.       The 2020 Action Plan      Proposals for action are designed to:      address a commonly identified need for joint action;       have an impact on the macro-region or a significant part of it, i.e. transnational;       be feasible for the actors in the Danube Region (practically, legally and financially);       be mutually coherent and supportive.       1.

summary of   Decision (EU) 2017/1324 approving the EU’s participation in the Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area (PRIMA)   what is the aim of this decision  It approves the EU’s participation in the Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area (PRIMA), an initiative involving a number of EU countries as well as several countries in the Mediterranean area.   key points    Participating countries   Currently the ‘participating states’ are: Croatia, Cyprus, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Tunisia and Turkey.  Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Morocco are expected to join PRIMA once they conclude international agreements for scientific and technological cooperation with the EU setting out the terms and conditions of their participation in PRIMA.  Other countries (both EU and non-EU) will be able to join at a later stage, provided they fulfill the conditions for participation in PRIMA.   Objectives   The idea behind PRIMA is to pool the knowledge and financial resources of the EU and the participating states to build  research and innovation capacities  and  develop knowledge  and  joint innovative solutions  for agro-food systems in the Mediterranean area.  The main objectives are to:   make the  agro-food systems and integrated water provision and management  more climate resilient, efficient, cost-effective and environmentally and socially sustainable;   contribute to solving  water scarcity  ,  food security  ,  nutrition  ,  health  ,  well-being  and  migration problems  upstream.    Management and organisation   The programme will be managed by an implementation structure, known as PRIMA-IS, based in Barcelona. PRIMA-IS will receive the EU’s financial contribution and be responsible for implementing PRIMA and monitoring the projects that it finances, as well as the projects that are funded by the participating states.  PRIMA will operate on the basis of  annual work plans  that it adopts, after the approval of the  European Commission  .  Approximately 25% of the PRIMA-IS funding is intended to finance the research work of bodies (e.g. universities, research institutions, companies, etc.) in the non-EU participating states. Information about the activities receiving support from PRIMA will be publicly available.   Budget   The EU will contribute up to €220 million from the  Horizon 2020  research and innovation framework programme. The participating states will contribute financially or in-kind at least €220 million during the period from 7 August 2017 to 31 December 2028.   from when does the decision apply  It has applied since 7 August 2017.   background   For more information, see:    The PRIMA initiative  (  European Commission  ).
summary of   Council Decision 2014/835/EU — agreement on the surrender procedure between the EU countries and Iceland and Norway   what does this decision do   It approves the agreement on the surrender procedure  *  between EU countries and Iceland and Norway.   key points    The agreement aims to enhance judicial cooperation in criminal matters between the EU countries and Iceland and Norway.   In particular it establishes a surrender system to  speed up the transfer of suspects and persons in custody  and to  ensure sufficient controls  on the execution of arrest warrants.    Scope    The arrest warrant may be issued either for acts punishable by a jail sentence or detention orders of  at least 12 months  or, where a sentence has been passed or a detention order made, for a sentence of at least 4 months.   For offences punishable by a jail sentence of at least 3 years, the parties can make a declaration to the effect that they do not require the condition of  double criminality   *  . These include:   participation in a criminal organisation,   terrorism,   trafficking in human beings,   child pornography,   illicit trafficking in human organs,   narcotics.     The list of offences is the same as that used by EU countries for the  European Arrest Warrant  .   Grounds for non-execution of the arrest warrant   The judicial authorities will refuse to execute an arrest warrant if:   the offence on which it is based is covered by an  amnesty  ;   the person has already been tried for the same acts and the sentence has been or is being served;   the person cannot be held criminally responsible owing to their  age  .   On the other hand, the countries may refuse to execute an arrest warrant in a number of cases, including if:   the acts on which the warrant is based do not constitute an offence in the country in which the suspect is being held (‘executing state’), except in relation to taxes, duties, customs and exchange;   the person is being prosecuted in the executing state for the same act;   the state has passed a final judgement for the same acts, which prevents further proceedings;   the authorities in the executing state have decided not to prosecute the person or have halted proceedings;   the requested person is a national or resident of the executing state and that state intends to carry out the sentence;   the offences were committed outside the territory of the country issuing the warrant (‘issuing state’) or the law of the executing state does not permit prosecution for those offences.    Arrest warrant    The arrest warrant contains details of the  identity  of the  requested person,  the  issuing authority,  the  sentence  and the  nature of the offence  .   It is transmitted as soon as the requested person is found, and then communicated to the  Schengen Information System  or, if this is not possible, to  Interpol  .   If the person consents to their surrender, the final decision on the execution of the arrest warrant should be taken  within 10 days  ; otherwise it should be taken within 60 days of the arrest.   If this is not possible, the issuing authorities must be informed of the reason for the delay and the  time limit may be extended by 30 days  .    Surrender procedure    When the person is arrested, they must be informed of the arrest warrant and its contents, of the possibility of consenting to surrender to the issuing authority and of their  right to be assisted by legal counsel and by an interpreter  .   The hearing is conducted  according to the law of the executing state  and in conditions fixed by common agreement. The person can choose whether or not to consent to their surrender if this choice is expressed voluntarily and in full awareness of the consequences.   The person should be surrendered  within10 days of the decision to execute the warrant  or, if that is impossible, within 10 days of the surrender date agreed between the authorities. If the person is still in custody at the end of that time, they must be released.   The executing authority will seize and hand over property that may serve as evidence or that has been acquired by the person as a result of the offence.    Surrender of the requested person   The countries party to the agreement must allow the person being surrendered to transit through their territory, provided that they have been given information about:   the identity of the person,   the existence of the arrest warrant,   the nature of the offence, and   a description of the circumstances.   from when does the decision apply  It has applied since 28 November 2014.   background    For more information, see  ‘European Arrest Warrant’  on the European Commission's website.   * key terms     Surrender procedure:  a procedure that allows a country to surrender a person to another country for the purpose of conducting a criminal prosecution or executing a custodial sentence or spell in detention.     Double criminality:  the requirement that the offence concerned must be a crime both in the country in which the suspect is being held and in the country which wishes them to be handed over to stand trial.
summary of   Regulation (EU) 2019/1149 establishing a European Labour Authority   what is the aim of the regulation  The principle of free movement of workers is enshrined in  Article 45  of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).  The regulation establishes the European Labour Authority (ELA), a body designed to help ensure fair labour mobility across the EU and support the coordination of social security systems.   key points   The regulation establishes the European Labour Authority, amending Regulations (EC) No 883/2004 on the  coordination of social security systems  , (EU) No 492/2011 on the  free movement of workers  , and (EU) 2016/589 on a  European network of employment services (EURES)  . It repeals Decision (EU) 2016/344 on  tackling undeclared work  .  It brings together the technical and operational tasks of several existing EU bodies:   the  EURES   European coordination office  ;   the  technical committee on the Free Movement of Workers  ;   the  Committee of Experts on the  Posting of Workers    *  ; and   the  European Platform tackling undeclared work  .   The European Labour Authority is part of the roll-out of the  European Pillar of Social Rights  .   Objectives and tasks   The ELA’s objectives are to:   ensure easier access to information on rights, obligations and services regarding labour mobility across the EU;   improve cooperation between countries to enforce the relevant laws across the EU, including joint inspections;   mediate and facilitate solutions where there are disputes between countries; and   support cooperation between EU countries to tackle undeclared work.   The ELA is responsible for:   improving the  availability, quality and accessibility of information  of a general nature offered to individuals, employers and  social partner organisations  regarding rights and obligations in relation to labour mobility;   supporting EU countries in providing  services to individuals and employers through EURES  , such as cross-border matching of job, traineeship, and apprenticeship vacancies with CVs;   facilitating the  cooperation and rapid exchange  of information between countries;   coordination and supporting  concerted   *  and joint  *   inspections  ;   cooperating with EU countries to  assess risks and carry out analyses on labour mobility  and social security coordination;   supporting EU countries to  build capacity for consistent enforcement of relevant EU law  , for instance through mutual assistance and training, including developing common guidelines;   reinforce the work of the  European Platform to enhance cooperation in tackling undeclared work  to share best practices, develop expertise and analysis and encourage innovative approaches;    mediating in and facilitating solutions to disputes  between EU countries to reconcile divergent points of view.    Organisation   The ELA administrative and management structure consists of a  management board  , an  executive director  and a  stakeholder group  .  The  management board  comprises:   1 member from each EU country,   2 members representing the  European Commission  ,   1 independent expert appointed by the  European Parliament  (without voting rights),   4 members representing cross-industry social partner organisations (without voting rights), with equal representation of trade unions and employer organisations.   Representatives of countries applying EU law within the scope of ELA, the EU agencies  Eurofound  ,  EU-OSHA  ,  Cedefop  or the  European Training Foundation  may be invited to participate as observers in meetings of the management board.   Fundamental rights   The regulation does not affect the exercise of  fundamental rights  as recognised at EU and national level, including the right or freedom to strike or to take other action covered by the specific industrial relations systems in EU countries in accordance with national law or practice.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 31 July 2019.   background   See also:    European Labour Authority  (  European Commission  )    European Pillar of Social Rights  (  European Commission  )    EURES The European Job Mobility Portal  (  European Commission  )    Free movement — EU nationals  (  European Commission  )    Undeclared work  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Posting of workers:  when a worker, for a limited period, carries out his/her work in the territory of an EU country other than the one in which he/she normally works.   Concerted inspection:  inspections carried out in 2 or more EU countries simultaneously regarding related cases, with each national authority operating in its own territory, and supported, where appropriate, by the staff of the ELA.   Joint inspection:  inspections carried out in an EU country with the participation of the national authorities of one or more other EU countries, and supported, where appropriate, by the staff of the ELA.
act   Regulation (EC) No  1072/2009  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 on common rules for access to the international road haulage market.   summary    what does this regulation do  It lays down common rules applicable to access to the market in the international carriage of goods* by road within the EU. It also lays down the conditions under which non-resident hauliers may operate transport services within an EU country.   key points   The law applies to:   the international carriage of goods by road for hire or reward* for journeys carried out within the EU;   the national carriage of goods by road carried out temporarily by a non-resident haulier;   the part of the journey that takes place in the territory of any EU country in transit, where the carriage takes place between an EU country and a non-EU country - it does not apply to the part of the journey on the territory of the EU country of loading or unloading.   To carry out international carriage, a haulier must possess a Community licence and, if the driver is a non-EU national, a driver attestation as well.  A  Community licence  is:   issued by the competent authorities of the EU country of establishment to any haulier who is entitled to carry out the international carriage of goods by road for hire or reward;   renewable for a period of up to 10 years;   issued in the name of the haulier and non-transferable.   A  driver attestation  is:   issued by the competent authorities of the EU country in which the haulier holding an EU licence is based who uses or employs a driver in that country who is neither an EU national nor a long-term resident   valid for a period of up to 5 years.   If these conditions are not met, the same authorities can reject an application for the issue or renewal of a licence or the issue of an attestation. If the holder of either a Community licence or driver attestation no longer satisfies the conditions or has supplied incorrect information, the licence or attestation is withdrawn.  The law imposes strict regulations on cabotage operations, in particular:   any haulier for hire or reward who is a Community licence holder and whose driver, if a non-EU national, holds a driver attestation, is entitled to carry out cabotage operations in an EU country (other than the one in which it is established) on a temporary basis following an international operation into that country;   after the goods concerned in the international carriage have been delivered, the hauliers have 7 days in which they may undertake up to 3 cabotage operations;   3 cabotage operations may also be carried out in any other EU country following an international carriage, with a limit of 1 operation per country.   This law only applies if the haulier can produce proof of the international carriage of goods into the EU country concerned as well as proof of each consecutive cabotage operation undertaken.  Cabotage operations are subject to national legislation in the host EU country regarding the:   conditions governing the transport contract;   weights and dimensions of road vehicles;   requirements concerning the carriage of certain categories of goods, in particular dangerous goods, perishable food items and live animals;   driving time and rest periods;   value added tax (VAT) on transport services.   The above laws and regulations apply equally to non-resident hauliers and to hauliers established in the host EU country.   Where a haulier infringes EU road transport legislation:    the competent authorities of the EU country of establishment may issue a warning or impose administrative penalties such as withdrawing the Community licence;   if the haulier is a non-resident, the EU country in which the infringement took place will inform the competent authority in the haulier’s country of establishment describing the infringement and the penalties imposed.   All serious infringements must be recorded in the national electronic register of road transport undertakings.  A 2014 Commission  report  on the EU road transport market found that:   EU countries’ authorities need to enforce the existing EU legislation more consistently and more effectively;   the EU can help by clarifying rules which are understood, interpreted and implemented differently in different EU countries;   social rules must be better applied in road transport to attract new drivers and to handle future demand for freight transport;   these changes can both increase the efficiency of the EU economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from road transport.   For more information, see the European Commission’s  road haulage website  .   key terms    * Road transport operation  : the entire journey of goods by road to their final destination   * Cabotage  : where a haulier registered in one EU country carries out national transport in another EU country.   * Carriage of goods  : the act of carrying and transporting goods.   *Hire or reward  : the carriage for remuneration, of persons or goods, on behalf of third parties (OECD definition).

   European Security Research and Innovation Agenda     European Security Research and Innovation Agenda     This communication is the Commission’s first reaction to the European Security Research and Innovation Forum’s (ESRIF) key findings and recommendations. ESRIF has defined a European Security Research and Innovation Agenda (ESRIA) that serves as a common strategic roadmap for security research and innovation to support the development of European security.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 21 December 2009 – “A European Security Research and Innovation Agenda – Commission’s initial position on ESRIF’s key findings and recommendations” [       COM(2009) 691      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     In light of modern security concerns, the       European Security Research and Innovation Forum      (ESRIF) was established in 2007 to develop a       European Security Research and Innovation Agenda (ESRIA)      . With a view to improving coherence at European Union (EU), national and regional levels, the agenda provides a common strategic roadmap for security research and innovation. This communication presents the Commission’s initial view on ESRIF’s key findings and recommendations for the agenda.      Societal security and resilience      The human and societal aspects of security must be at the heart of security research. The EU must strengthen the       legal and ethical dimensions      of all security solutions to guarantee the rights and freedoms of individuals, in particular as regards privacy. In addition, it must reinforce the       societal dimension      of security technologies to ensure that they allow societies to effectively respond to risks and losses (“societal resilience”).      Industrial policy      The EU security industry has previously suffered from the fragmentation of markets, which has led it to be nationally or even regionally oriented. To protect the interests of its citizens and provide for a competitive security industry, the EU needs to pursue a strong and independent technological and scientific base. It should aim for a leadership position in the global security market, endorsing the idea of a Lead Market Initiative (LMI) for the sector. To this end, the EU needs to develop an ambitious industrial policy that will:       overcome market fragmentation        , by putting in place certification, validation and standardisation -mechanisms (including a “European Security Label”), harmonising the regulatory framework, and developing technical and organisational interoperability standards to improve exchanges of information, especially on cross-border security issues;        strengthen the industrial base        , by mapping the competencies of the European Security Technological and Industrial Base (ESTIB), supporting innovation policy by bringing innovative security sectors into the LMI and accelerating pre-commercial procurement, promoting the take up of security issues already at the conception stage of new products/systems (“security by design”), and strengthening complementarity and cooperation between civil and defence technologies in specific areas.       Security research and development (R&D) roadmap      Since the thorough anticipation of future security threats is not possible, the EU should focus its security R&D on strengthening its ability to resist and recover from crises, both from the technological and societal points of view. Divided into five clusters, the ESRIA provides an integrative approach to R&D support for       current security missions      :      classic security cycle of preventing, protecting, preparing, responding and recovering;       countering of different means of attack;       securing critical assets/infrastructures;       securing identity, access and movement of people and goods;       cross-cutting enablers, in particular Information and Communication Technologies (ICT).      For       future security missions      , the R&D measures need to be further assessed. ESRIF recommends that particular attention is given to some research areas that were excluded from its mandate and that will likely increase in importance in future, in particular the       external dimension of security      . The Commission believes that further consideration also needs to be given to the inclusion of civil protection as well as conflict prevention and post crisis management into security R&D programmes.     For future solutions to correspond to the real needs of public and private       end-users      , they as well as supply and demand stakeholders must be consulted actively throughout the security research policy planning, execution and review cycles. Furthermore, ESRIF encourages the development of a strategic and coordinated approach to trans-European cooperation and the setting-up of an Internal Security Fund to provide resources for security R&D. Finally,       education and training      should be better used to raise public awareness of all security-related issues.     See also       ESRIF        website      Last updated: 11.05.2010  
   Strategy for a more competitive European defence industry     Strategy for a more competitive European defence industry     The Member States have control over their essential defence and security interests. However, to ensure the survival of the sector it is essential to have a strategy at European level. Here the Commission presents a series of recommendations with a view to making the European defence industry more competitive.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 5 December 2007 – A strategy for a stronger and more competitive European defence industry [       COM(2007) 764      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The European security and defence policy (ESDP) needs a strong European defence industry. However, this sector's performance and competitiveness are being held back by an inadequate policy and legal framework, resulting in red tape and duplication, hampering innovation and increasing prices. For example, the co-existence of different national regulations on procurement, slow licensing procedures for the free movement of defence components and goods within the EU, lack of information sharing, etc. are obstacles to this sector's competitiveness. With a view to improving the situation in the European defence industry, the Commission puts forward several recommendations.      Improving the functioning of the internal market for defence products      In order to improve the functioning of the internal market in defence, the Commission proposes that Member States adopt two directives. The first is designed to facilitate       intra-EU transfers of defence products      by eliminating unnecessary paperwork. It will thus reduce obstacles to trade in these products in the EU, for example by significantly simplifying national licensing procedures and costly and lengthy administrative formalities which could act as a deterrent to some companies. The second directive is designed to enhance the openness and competitiveness of       defence procurement      . Member States too often use Article 296 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which allows them to be exempt from Community rules if their essential security interests are threatened. This directive will therefore effectively introduce intra-EU competition in the Member States' defence markets.     In addition to these legislative initiatives, the Commission is considering a whole series of measures, including:      the use of a handbook of common standards to facilitate the opening of defence markets;       examination of the current regime on security of information for the exchange of sensitive information between Member States and European companies in order to determine whether it would be useful to introduce a European system;       a study on control of strategic defence assets;       the use of legal instruments at the Commission's disposal to ensure fair competition in defence markets.       Improving overall coordination      Together with the European Defence Agency (EDA), the Commission wishes to encourage better overall coordination with the Member States and among Member States, so that the weapons systems needed by European armed forces can be produced cost-effectively and with the highest level of performance. Coordination between Member States can be improved in three areas: pooling of demand for military equipment, research and technological development, and strengthening the position of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).     It is in Member States' interest to coordinate their investments and       pool demand      in order to create synergies. This can be done by adjusting the timetables of their development and procurement programmes and by collecting information on Member States' investments.     Defence is a technology-intensive sector. Yet, in Europe, investment in       research      is fragmented, leading to duplication and a waste of scarce resources. It therefore makes sense to find ways to pool research and network resources at all levels. Defence-related research creates a spillover in many other areas and creates growth in civil sectors, which in turn contribute a great deal to defence. The Commission therefore recommends pooling the resources of civil and military programmes at both national and European levels. The Commission is also conducting a specific security research programme.     The       position of SMEs      in the sector needs to be strengthened. They will be able to benefit from the two directives mentioned above but also from other initiatives, including the 7th Framework Programme for Research, or for example the Code of Best Practice and the       e-portal      developed by the EDA.      Supporting the adjustment and modernisation process in Europe by means of accompanying policies      The defence sector can be stimulated not only by industrial policy but also by other policies. The       opening of foreign markets      is thus essential to the competitiveness of the European industry. For Europe to improve its access to the US market, which is practically non-existent, it is important to ensure that the European defence industry can match its competitors in the US in terms of innovation and quality. It is also important not to lose sight of other stakeholders from the emerging economies for which it is necessary to analyse the competition challenges and the conditions of access to their markets.     Further market integration in the defence sector could lead to structural changes and restructuring, and it is necessary to       anticipate and address any such structural changes      , for example by means of an active social dialogue. These changes can be managed financially with the help of the Structural Funds and the European Social Fund in particular.     Finally, it is necessary to       improve European defence industry market governance.      In order to fully exploit the measures to increase competition which are set out in this Communication, a structured dialogue with all interested parties is essential, in particular with the competent bodies of the Member States and the EDA. The EU should also set up a European think-tank to reflect on the challenges and key issues in the defence sector.     Last updated: 14.03.2008

SUMMARY     The Outermost Regions (OR) are listed in Article       349      of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU:      the French Overseas Departments (OD): Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, Réunion, Saint-Barthélemy, Saint-Martin;       the Azores and Madeira (Portugal);       the Canary Islands (Spain).      These regions are called ‘outermost’ due to their geographical remoteness from Europe. The OR generally have a small surface area and are exposed to difficult climates. All these factors present difficulties for the agricultural development of the OR.     This Regulation lays down measures specific to the OR in the area of agriculture. The objective is to meet the additional costs related to the supply arrangements and agricultural activities of these regions.      Specific supply arrangements      Some agricultural products (listed in Annex I to the Treaty), considered to be essential for human and animal consumption or for the production of other products, are covered by specific support arrangements (or SSAs). Under this system, limited amounts of these products may be introduced from the EU with the granting of aid to cover a part of the additional costs related to remoteness or from third countries without being subject to any kind of import duty.     The maximum amounts of products covered by these arrangements are established in a       forecast supply balance      produced by Member States before being approved by the Commission.     The products covered by these arrangements can only be exported following the payment of import duties and the reimbursement of aid received under these arrangements. This condition does not apply to products which are exchanged between French overseas departments nor to products processed in the outermost regions using products which have benefited from the special arrangements, if they are:      exported to third countries or dispatched to the rest of the EU within the limits of dispatches or exports as part of traditional trade flows;       exported to third countries as part of regional trade flows;       dispatched from the Azores to Madeira or vice versa;       dispatched from Madeira to the Canary Islands or vice versa.      Under the specific supply arrangements, no import duty is due on certain types of sugar imported into Madeira and the Canary Islands and certain products from the rice sector imported into Réunion. Aid is also paid for supplies of milk-based preparations imported into the Canary Islands, which are not included in Annex I to the Treaty.      Support for local agricultural production       Community support programmes      promote local agricultural production. They are prepared by the competent authorities appointed by the Member States concerned. Their preparation should take EU legislation and policy into account.     The Regulation stipulates that the Community support programmes should indicate:      a quantified description of the agricultural production situation in the regions in question;       a description of the strategy proposed and an appraisal showing the expected economic, environmental and social impact;       a description of the measures contemplated;       a schedule for the implementation of the measures and a general indicative financing table showing the resources to be deployed;       proof of the compatibility and consistency of the various measures under the programmes and a definition of the criteria and quantitative indicators to be used for monitoring and evaluation;       the steps taken to ensure the programmes are implemented effectively and appropriately, the definition of quantified indicators for use in programme evaluation and the provisions for checks and penalties;       the designation of the competent authorities and bodies responsible for implementing the programme, the designation of associated bodies and socio-economic partners, and the results of the consultations held.       Annual financial resources      The specific supply arrangements and the measures to promote local agricultural production benefit from the following annual financial allocations (in EUR million):         2007 financial year             2008 financial year             2009 financial year             2010 financial year             2011 financial year             French overseas departments             126.6             262.6             269.4             273.0             278.41             Azores and Madeira             77.9             86.98             87.08             87.18             106.21             Canary Islands             127.3             268.4             268.4             268.4             268.42         As regards the specific supply arrangements, financing should not exceed the following amounts:      For the French overseas departments: EUR 20.7 million       Azores and Madeira : EUR 17.7 million       Canary Islands: EUR 72.7 million       Accompanying measures      In addition to the specific supply arrangements and the Community support programmes, this Regulation also introduces other types of derogating measures promoting the agricultural development of the OR.     First, the Regulation provides for the option of increasing European financial aid provided to the OR under the Common Agricultural Policy. The OR benefit from derogations with regard to the maximum eligible amounts of financing from the       European Agricultural Guarantee Fund      (EAGF) and the       European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development      (EAFRD).     In addition, the Regulation provides for the option for Member States of granting State aid for the production, processing and marketing of agricultural products listed in Annex I to the Treaty. However, this State aid remains subject to authorisation by the Commission.     Furthermore, France and Portugal may present programmes to the Commission for the       control of organisms harmful to plants or plant products      (with the exception of bananas) in their respective outermost regions. The EU contributes to the financing of these programmes on the basis of a technical analysis of the circumstances at the regional level, up to 60 % of eligible expenditure for the French overseas departments and 75 % for the Azores and Madeira.     Lastly, this Regulation makes provisions for derogations and exemptions that are specific to the outermost regions in four sectors:       wine        : the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands benefit from derogations to Regulation (EC) No         1234/2007        for abandonment premiums, aid for release from storage and measures concerning distillation.        milk        : only producers in the Azores are regarded as having participated in the overrun of the reference quantity for the purposes of sharing the additional levy under         Regulation (EC) No 1788/2003        . Madeira (within a local production limit of 4 000 tonnes of milk) and the French overseas departments are exempt from the additional levy scheme applicable to producers of cow's milk laid down by Regulation (EC) No         1788/2003        . Madeira is permitted to produce, solely for local consumption purposes, UHT milk reconstituted from Community milk powder, by derogation from Council Regulation (EC) No         2597/97        .        livestock farming        : the French overseas departments and Madeira may import bovine animals from third countries without applying the customs duties. This practice is allowed until the herd of local young male bovine animals reaches a sufficient level to ensure the continuation and development of local animal production.        tobacco        : Spain may grant aid for the production of tobacco in the Canary Islands up to the limit of 10 tonnes per year. In addition, no customs duties are applied to direct imports into the Canary Islands of certain raw and semi-manufactured tobaccos.       Context      Agriculture in the outermost regions has benefited from the POSEI system (Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity) since 1991 for the French OD (POSEIDOM) and since 1992 for the Canary Islands (POSEICAN), the Azores and Madeira (POSEIMA). The objective of the POSEI system consisted of taking into consideration the geographical and economic handicaps of these regions.     This Regulation therefore reforms the POSEI system and repeals Regulations No       1452/2001      , No       1453/2001      and No       1454/2001      .

   Road haulage and passenger transport companies: operating rules     Road haulage and passenger transport companies: operating rules     SUMMARY OF:      Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 setting common rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator       Regulation (EU) 2020/1055 amending Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 to adapt it to developments in the road transport sector      WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?      Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009:       sets out rules for companies wanting to enter and be active in the road haulage (i.e. transport of goods by road) and passenger transport business;       applies to all companies established in the EU that are active in (or intending to be active in) transporting goods or people in exchange for payment.       Amending Regulation (EU) 2020/1055      updates the rules for pursuing the occupation of road transport operator in order to combat the phenomenon of letterbox companies       *      and unfair competition.     KEY POINTS     Companies active in the road transport operator business must:      be effectively and stably established in an EU country;       be of good repute;       have appropriate financial standing; and       have the required professional competence.       Transport manager      Every road transport company must designate a       transport manager      who is responsible for continuously managing its transport activities. This manager must reside in the EU and have a genuine link to the undertaking, for example as an employee, administrator or shareholder.      How to become a road transport operator       A company wanting to be active in the road transport operator business must be         established        in an EU country with premises in that EU country where it can keep all of the         documents        (accounts, personnel management documents and data relating to driving time and rest, etc.) required for its business.       The company should have at least one         vehicle registered        in that EU country at its disposal (once an authorisation has been granted) and have an operating centre situated in that country with the appropriate technical equipment and facilities for the operation of the vehicle(s).       In addition:          neither the company nor the manager can have been convicted for any infringement of certain national and EU rules relating to road transport;           the company must be able to meet its financial obligations;           the manager must have passed a compulsory written examination, which may be supplemented by an oral examination.         Authorisation and monitoring       EU countries must designate one or more         competent authorities        responsible for:          examining applications made by companies;           granting permits to set up as a road transport operator;           declaring a person to be fit/unfit to manage a company’s transport activities;           checking that the company fulfils all the relevant requirements.         The competent authorities are also responsible for following up companies’ applications for registration within 3 months. In addition, they can declare a company unfit to manage transport activities.       Simplification and administrative cooperation       Each EU country must keep a         national electronic register        of companies authorised to be active in the road transport operator business. The competent national authorities are responsible for supervising the data in that register.       The national registers are to be interconnected, allowing the competent authorities of any EU country to consult the national electronic register of any other EU country.       Amending Regulation (EU) 2020/1055      The main changes introduced to Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 by amending Regulation (EU) 2020/1055 include the following.      Replacing the article on conditions relating to the requirement of a transport undertaking being established (Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009) in order to combat the phenomenon of letterbox companies. It thus tightens the link between the transport operator’s place of establishment and its activities.       Extending the rules to cover vans used in international transport (light commercial vehicles weighing over 2.5 tonnes).       Requiring the         European Commission        to adopt         implementing acts        laying down a list of categories, types and degrees of gravity of serious infringements of EU rules.       Introducing new administrative procedures where a transport manager or a company has seriously infringed EU rules.       Introducing new rules concerning a haulier’s good repute: the minimum period after which transport managers who have lost their good repute can have it restored is 1 year. Managers who have lost their good repute must prove that they have followed a minimum level of training or passed an examination demonstrating knowledge of the subjects listed in Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009.       Revising Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 clarifying the most serious infringements.       Requiring transport companies to demonstrate, on the basis of annual accounts certified by an auditor or a duly accredited person, that for each year it has specific levels of capital and reserves at its disposal.      FROM WHEN DOES THIS REGULATION APPLY?      Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 has applied since 4 December 2011.       Amending Regulation (EU) 2020/1055 will apply from 21 February 2022.      BACKGROUND     For more information, see:       Rules governing access to the profession        (         European Commission        ).      KEY TERMS      Letterbox companies:      companies which have been set up with the purpose of benefitting from legislative loopholes while not providing any service to clients themselves, but rather providing a front for services provided by their owners (       COM(2013) 122 final      ).

   Turkey – Environment     Turkey – Environment     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM(2011) 666      final – SEC(2011) 1201 - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The       2011 Report      highlights the progress made by Turkey with regard to the environment, particularly concerning waste management. However, it notes limited advancements concerning water quality, chemical products and administrative capacities. Furthermore, the country must put in place a more effective policy on climate.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission’s words)      EU environment policy aims to promote sustainable development and protect the environment for present and future generations. It is based on the integration of environmental protection into other EU policies, preventive action, the polluter pays principle, fighting environmental damage at source and shared responsibility. The       acquis      comprises over 200 legal acts covering horizontal legislation, water and air pollution, management of waste and chemicals, biotechnology, nature protection, industrial pollution and risk management, and noise.     Ensuring compliance with the       acquis      requires significant investment, but also brings significant benefits for public health and reduces costly damage to forests, buildings, landscapes and fisheries. A strong and well-equipped administration at national, regional and local level is imperative for the application and enforcement of the environment       acquis      .      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      In the       environment      area, Turkey has made good progress on waste management, whereas only limited progress can be reported on horizontal legislation, air quality and industrial pollution control and risk management. Turkey made very limited progress on water quality, chemicals and on administrative capacity. No progress can be reported on nature protection.     Regarding       climate change      , Turkey made limited progress on awareness-raising on EU climate requirements, but a more robust and ambitious climate policy, both domestically and internationally, has yet to be established. There is a need to enhance administrative capacity.     RELATED ACTS      Commission Report [         COM(2010) 660        final – SEC(2010) 1327 - Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2010 Report stressed that progress has been made on alignment, although preparations in the field of the environment were still at an initial stage. The progress related in particular to waste management, air and water quality, industrial pollution and chemicals. Efforts were still needed in the fields of climate and nature protection.      Commission Report [         COM(2009) 533        final – SEC(2009) 1334 – Not published in the Official Journal].       Commission Report [         COM(2008) 674        – SEC(2008) 2699 final – Not published in the Official Journal].      The November 2008 Report highlighted the strengthening of administrative capacity and the application of some reforms (air quality, water quality). However, the level of alignment was still low, and some laws adopted in 2008 continued to seriously endanger the environment (particularly in the field of mining operations and tourism).      Commission Report [         COM(2007) 663        final – SEC(2007) 1436 - Not published in the Official Journal].      The November 2007 Report described substantial progress in terms of administrative capacity, but little or no progress in different environmental areas. The general level of transposition was low.      Commission Report [         COM(2006) 649        final – SEC(2005) 1390 – Not published in the Official Journal].      In its November 2006 Report, the Commission notes that, except for some progress on waste management and noise, the overall level of transposition of the environmental       acquis      remains low. The lack of progress on horizontal legislation is of increasing concern, in particular on transboundary issues and on public consultation.      Commission Report [         COM(2005) 561        final – SEC(2005) 1426 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The November 2005 Report stressed the progress made regarding waste management, noise and nature protection. The overall level of transposition of the environmental       acquis      was limited.      Commission Report [         COM(2004) 656        final – SEC(2004) 1201 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The October 2004 Report noted that despite some progress, the overall level of transposition of the environment       acquis      remained low. Moreover, weaknesses in implementation and enforcement were still sources of major concern. Considerable investments needed to be secured.      Commission Report [         COM(2003) 676        final – SEC(2003) 1212 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The November 2003 Report stated that the level of alignment and the implementation of legislation were inadequate.      Commission Report [         COM(2002) 700        final – SEC(2002) 1412 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The October 2002 Report indicated that Turkey had started to make progress in transposing the       acquis      and that notable progress had been achieved regarding the improvement of administrative capacities.      Commission Report [         COM(2001) 700        final – SEC(2001) 1756 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The November 2001 Report noted that Turkey had not made any substantial progress on transposing the       acquis      .      Commission Report [         COM(2000) 713        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      The November 2000 Report stated that no progress had been recorded in the fields of air quality, waste management water quality, nature protection, industrial pollution risks, chemical products, genetically modified organisms (GMOs), the ozone layer and nuclear safety.

summary of   Commission Communication COM(2015) 366 final — Towards a more prosperous Alpine region   summary    what does this communication do  To help the  Alpine region  face various economic, demographic and environmental challenges, this  European Commission  communication proposes an EU strategy for the Alpine region (Eusalp). It includes an  action plan  which seeks to promote sustainable economic and social prosperity in the region.   key points   The Eusalp is the fourth  EU macro-regional strategy  *. It concerns seven countries and  48 regions including  :        —     five EU countries: Germany, France, Italy Austria, and Slovenia; and            —     two non-EU countries: Liechtenstein and Switzerland.       Challenges   The Alpine region faces several challenges which require a  joint response  :        —      demographic trends  — ageing, low population density in the core mountain areas and new migration trends (i.e. population movement towards urban areas due to lack of infrastructure in the countryside);            —     high vulnerability to  climate change  and its effects on the environment, biodiversity and people’s living conditions;            —     specific geographical position in Europe, as a transit region;            —     management of  energy demand  ;            —     high degree of seasonality, especially in some tourist areas;            —     significant social and economic disparities between different areas in the region.       Objectives of the strategy: three thematic and one horizontal   More effective cooperation between regions and states is needed to tackle these challenges. The strategy is therefore built upon three thematic  action-oriented objectives  :   Thematic actions         1.     Offering fair access to job opportunities and building on the high competitiveness of the region by boosting  economic growth and innovation  . Actions in the field may take the form of research activities on Alpine-specific products and services and innovative approaches to strengthen the region’s sustainability.            2.     Ensuring internal and external  accessibility and connectivity for all the region  ’  s inhabitants  . Actions are designed to promote both better mobility, by using different kinds of transport alternatives (intermodality and interoperability) in passenger and freight transport, and the extension of internet and phone access in remote areas.            3.    Making the region  environmentally sustainable and attractive  by pooling mutual resources to:        —     preserve cultural heritage and the environment;             —     promote the sustainable production of reliable energy solutions.          In addition, there will be a fourth cross-cutting objective that will aim to build a sound macro-regional governance model to improve cooperation. In this context, the Commission will act as an  independent facilitator  and will ensure strategic coordination in partnership with the participating countries and regions and in accordance with the subsidiarity principle.   Implementation and EU added value   The Eusalp aims to provide a cooperation framework where macro-regional topics can be jointly addressed not only to achieve more coherence, but also to involve more players from different levels across all regions involved.  Eusalp also seeks to build a new relationship between metropolitan and mountain areas (including the areas in between).  The strategy will be based on the same key principles that apply to the existing macro-regional strategies:        —     no new EU funds;            —     no additional EU formal structures;            —     no additional EU legislation.      It will also rely on a  coordinated approach, synergies and the more effective use of existing EU funds  and other financial instruments.  The strategy will mobilise and bring together EU regional policy 2014-2020 programmes (such as under  EU Structural and Investment Funds  ), as well as other relevant regional and national policy frameworks.   key term    *A macro-regional strategy  is an integrated framework that addresses the common challenges faced by a given geographical area.  There are currently four EU macro-regional strategies:        —     the  EU strategy for the Baltic Sea region  ;            —     the  EU strategy for the Danube region  ;            —     the  EU strategy for the Adriatic and Ionian region  ;            —     the EU strategy for the Alpine region.      background         —      The EU strategy for the Alpine region             —      Press release             —      Eusalp website       act   Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions concerning a European Union strategy for the Alpine region (  COM(2015) 366 final  , 28.7.2015)
summary of   Regulation (EC) No 549/2004 laying down the framework for the creation of the single European sky (the framework Regulation)   what is the aim of the regulation   It is part of a package of legislation on air traffic management designed to establish a  single European sky  to ensure the optimal use of European airspace to meet the requirements of all airspace users.   This regulation aims to:   improve current safety standards and overall efficiency for general air traffic in Europe;   optimise capacity; and   minimise delays.     The regulation was amended by Regulation (EC) No  1070/2009  in view of the plan to extend the responsibilities of the  European Union Aviation Safety Agency  to include air traffic management safety. This amendment permits the  European Commission  to update legislation in line with to technical or operational developments, as well as to lay down the basic criteria and procedures for using certain network management functions.   key points    National supervisory authorities    EU countries must, jointly or individually, nominate or establish one or more bodies as their national supervisory authorities to perform the tasks assigned to such authorities by the regulation.   These authorities must be independent of air navigation service providers.    Single Sky Committee    A Single Sky Committee is set up to assist the Commission with managing the single European sky and to ensure that due account is taken of the interests of all categories of users.   It consists of 2 representatives of each EU country and is chaired by a representative of the Commission.    Implementing rules    Eurocontrol  is involved in the development of implementing rules which fall within its remit, on the basis of mandates agreed by the Single Sky Committee.   Performance review   The regulation introduces a performance review mechanism for air navigation services and network functions. This includes:   EU-wide performance targets on the key performance areas of safety, the environment, capacity and cost-efficiency;   national plans or plans for  functional airspace blocks   *  ensuring consistency with the EU-wide targets; and   periodic review, monitoring and benchmarking of the performance of air navigation services and network functions.   Commission Implementing Regulation (EU)  2019/317  lays down the rules for operating the performance scheme for air navigation services and network functions, and those relating to the charging scheme referred to in Regulation (EC) No  550/2004  on air navigation services — see  summary  .   Safeguards   This regulation does not prevent EU countries from applying measures needed to safeguard essential security or defence policy interests.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 20 April 2004.   background   The first ‘Single European sky’ package consists of this framework regulation plus 3 technical regulations on the  provision of air navigation services  (Regulation (EC) No  550/2004  ),  organisation and use of the airspace  (Regulation (EC) No  551/2004  ) and the  interoperability of the European air traffic management network  (now under Regulation (EU)  2018/1139  or other related delegated or implementing regulations which repealed and replaced Regulation (EC) No  552/2004  ). These regulations are designed, in particular, to improve and reinforce safety and to reorganise the airspace on the basis of traffic instead of national borders.  For more information, see:    Single European Sky  (  European Commission  )   key terms    Functional airspace block:  an airspace block based on operational requirements rather than national borders, where air navigation and related services are performance-driven and optimised in order to introduce, in each functional airspace block, enhanced cooperation among air navigation service providers or, where appropriate, an integrated provider.
   Community financial aid to trans-European networks     Community financial aid to trans-European networks     Trans-European network policy depends on financial instruments being available to support projects with the highest trans-European added value. This regulation establishes the conditions and procedures for granting Community aid to projects of common interest in the field of trans-European networks for transport, energy and telecommunications.     ACT     Regulation (EC) No       67/2010      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 November 2009 laying down general rules for the granting of Community financial aid in the field of trans-European networks.     SUMMARY     This regulation establishes the conditions and procedures for granting Community aid to projects of common interest in the field of       trans-European networks for infrastructures in the fields of telecommunications, transport and energy      .     Community aid may only be granted to projects of common interest. Parts of projects are also eligible when they form units which are technically and financially independent.     Community aid for projects can take one or more of the following forms:       co-financing of studies        related to projects – except in exceptional cases, the Community contribution may not exceed 50% of the total cost of a study;        subsidies of the interest on loans        granted by the European Investment Bank or other public or private financial bodies;        contributions towards premiums for loan guarantees        from the European Investment Fund or other financial institutions;        direct grants to investments        in duly justified cases;        risk-capital participation for investment funds        with a focus on providing risk capital for trans-European network projects and involving substantial investment from the private-sector.      At least 55% of the funding for transport infrastructure projects should be allocated to railways (including combined transport) and a maximum of 25% to roads.      Conditions for financial aid      Community aid may be granted if the following conditions are fulfilled:      there is a financial obstacle to the achievement of a project;       the Community aid must not exceed the minimum necessary for the launch of a project;       except in exceptional circumstances, the total amount of Community aid must not exceed 10% of the total investment cost;       the Community aid must not, in principle, be granted to projects benefitting from other sources of Community funding.      The Commission may establish an       indicative multiannual programme      by sector to improve the efficiency of the European Union (EU). The programme will consist of projects of common interest in specific fields which require substantial funding over a long period of time. The programme must be reviewed, and if necessary revised, with regard to the effective progress of the projects.      Project selection criteria      Community aid is intended for projects that are       potentially economically viable      and for which the financial profitability at the time of application is deemed insufficient. The decision to grant Community assistance should also take account of:      the         maturity        of the project;       the         stimulative effect        on public and private finance;       the         soundness        of the financial package;        direct or indirect socio-economic effects        , especially on employment;       the         environmental consequences        .      In particular in the case of cross-border projects, coordination between the various parts of the project must be taken into consideration.      Applications for financial aid      Applications for funding must be submitted to the Commission by the EU country concerned or, with the agreement of the EU country, by the body directly concerned. This regulation stipulates the information required for the assessment and identification of applications, including a provisional timetable and a description of control measures to be put in place by the EU country concerned over the use of the requested funds.      Reduction, suspension and cancellation of aid      The Commission may reduce, suspend or cancel aid for a project if, after examination, there is an       irregularity      or a       failure to comply      with one of the conditions, or a       significant change in the nature of the project      for which the Commission’s approval was not requested.     Except in exceptional circumstances, approved aid will be cancelled by the Commission if the project has not started within two years following the expected start date. The Commission may demand reimbursement of any aid paid if the project in question has not been completed within ten years.      Funding      The financial framework for the implementation of this regulation for the period 2000 to 2006 is EUR 4 874 880 000.

   Environment Policy Review - 2008     Environment Policy Review - 2008     The 2008 Environment Policy Review reports on the progress made in European Union (EU) policy during 2008 and analyses future challenges.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 24 June 2009: 2008 Environment Policy Review [       COM(2009) 304      final Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The environment is at the top of the policy agenda. This transversal policy can help the European Union (EU) to emerge from the global economic and financial crisis which affected the European continent in 2008, by paving the way for low-carbon growth and enhancing energy efficiency.     In this Communication, the Commission reviews the events which marked EU environment policy during 2008. It describes in particular the progress made in the four priority areas established by the       Sixth Environment Action Programme      : climate change, biodiversity, the environment and health, and the sustainable management of resources and wastes.     The fight against       climate change      was emphasised in December 2008 by a series of legislative proposals forming the climate-energy package and demonstrating the EU’s commitment to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 % of 1990 levels by 2020 if other developed countries agreed comparable reductions or by at least 20% if they did not. This package aims at improving the       Community greenhouse gas emission allowance trading scheme      (EU ETS) and extending it to other greenhouse gases and other sectors. It also includes a proposal aimed at       promoting renewable energies      and another aimed at the reliable deployment of capture technologies and       carbon storage      .     Aside from the climate-energy package, the EU adopted other measures relating to climate change to reduce       CO2 emissions on new vehicles      and improve       fuel quality      .     The negotiation programme established at the Poznan conference in December 2008 should lead to a global agreement on climate change at the December 2009 United Nations Climate Conference in Copenhagen. This agreement will replace the Kyoto Protocol when it expires in 2012.     With regard to the loss of       biodiversity      , the EU has continued its efforts in accordance with the Community Action Plan aimed at halting the reduction of biological diversity by 2010. The main measures that have been implemented consist of developing the       Natura 2000 network      by creating new sites in Bulgaria and Romania, and combating the spread of invasive species by proposing a number of strategic options including the creation of a Europe-wide early warning system to report new or emerging species.     In 2008, two initiatives were introduced to protect global forests which contribute to tackling climate change and the reduction in biodiversity. The first is a Regulation framing the timber and timber products market in Europe, and the second is a Communication presenting proposals from the Commission in order to       combat tropical deforestation      .     In the future, work will be directed at increasing biodiversity protection in the high seas under the Convention on Biological Diversity and related to the work of the International Whaling Commission, and at the prohibition of products from seals sacrificed with disregard for animal welfare rules.     In the area of       environment      and       health      , 2008 was marked by the entry into force of the       REACH Regulation      , aimed at reinforcing safety standards for chemicals produced in or imported into the EU. Other measures have been adopted concerning       dangerous substances      and       mercury      . The Directive on       ambient air quality and pure air for Europe      came into force in June. The Commission presented initiatives for sustainable transport and to reduce industrial emissions.     For 2009, work in the area of the environment and health will be concentrated on the amendment of the Directive on       biocidal products      and the establishment of new standards for vehicle emissions in order to adapt it to the REACH Regulation.     Concerning the       management of natural       resources and waste      , EU action relates to the protection of the water cycle (       surface water      and the       marine environment      ), the development of sustainable production and consumption (       ecodesign      and the       Ecolabel Scheme      ) and the improvement of       waste recycling      (       ship dismantling      ,       electrical and electronic equipment      and       bio-waste      ).     In 2009, the EU plans to introduce an environmental technology verification scheme to boost the confidence of buyers in the performance of new environmental technologies.     In 2008, progress was accomplished towards       simplifying environment legislation      through the development of programmes intended to improve the implementation of Community environmental laws. The Commission plans to use a broad set of tools to prevent breaches of the law, such as targeted use of Community funds and enhanced pre-accession support for enlargement countries.      Context      This annual activity report is a contribution to the Lisbon Process and the European Sustainable Development Strategy, of which the environment is an essential element.

   eSafety: the use of information and communication technology (ICT) for road safety     eSafety: the use of information and communication technology (ICT) for road safety     The European Union (EU) wishes to reduce by half the number of road fatalities by 2010. To achieve this goal, it believes that vehicle safety should be enhanced. As ICT offers great prospects in this regard, the Commission proposes the systematic use of these technologies in order to design safer and more intelligent vehicles. To promote the large-scale marketing of intelligent car safety systems, it proposes three types of actions: promoting intelligent safety systems, adapting legislation and standards, and removing social and commercial barriers.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 15 September 2003 on Information and Communications Technologies for Safe and Intelligent Vehicles [       COM(2003) 542      final - Not published in the Official Journal]     SUMMARY     Transport provides for a basic need: mobility. As the number of cars on the road increases, their safety is constantly increased. Nevertheless, 40 000 people still die in road accidents each year which are the main cause of death for people under the age of 45 in Europe. Against this background, new measures are needed to achieve the main objective of the       European Action Programme for Road Safety      which is to reduce by half the number of road fatalities by 2010.     In order to achieve this objective, the Commission is banking on new information and communications technologies (ICT). Aware of the possibilities which ICT offers, the European Commission has launched the       eSafety initiative      which is intended to bring together all the stakeholders in order to work out recommendations and actions at EU level. The final report of the eSafety working group [       PDF      ] indicates that intelligent car safety systems offer the best prospects for ICT applications. Through this Communication, the Commission outlines its intention to support the development and as broad a dissemination as possible of these systems.      ICT in vehicles: a modern safety system      Accident prevention measures focused on the driver and the vehicle have led to a steady reduction of the number of fatalities on European roads. However, these "conventional" safety measures are reaching their limits. Bearing this in mind, the Commission emphasises the need to develop modern ICT-based safety systems.     In view of the progress already made in developing intelligent safety systems through research and technological development (RTD), the Commission intends to turn it into an area of priority action in RTD.     Intelligent car safety systems reduce the proportion of accidents due to the human factor (95%). These systems make use of ICT to provide solutions for improving road safety in particular in the pre-crash phase. These systems operate either autonomously on board the vehicle or co-operatively through vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. They make it possible to ensure safe speed, lane support, safe following, pedestrian protection, improved vision, driver monitoring and intersection safety. Their two major contributions are that they prevent collisions during lane changes or lane departure and provide vehicles with an automatic emergency call system (       eCall      ).      Support for the car industry      Because of the laws of the market and car manufacturers' need for profitability, the development and deployment of such large-scale intelligent safety systems cannot be left to the market alone. The fact is that these technologies place serious constraints on the car industry, entailing higher production costs, energy consumption and vehicle weight.     Moreover, developing integrated intelligent road safety systems requires the involvement of many other actors such as telecommunications operators, equipment manufacturers, service providers, motorway managers, road authorities, insurance companies, road safety organisations and user associations.     Against this background, it is the Commission's view that the European, national and regional public authorities should lend their support to the private sector (in particular to the car industry) to ensure the wide-spread sale and distribution of intelligent vehicles.     Public support can take various forms: promoting standardisation, launching awareness and information campaigns or providing financial incentives.      Actions envisaged by the Commission      To provide support, the Commission proposes actions in the following three categories:       promoting intelligent vehicle safety systems:       - continue support for the eSafety forum which is intended to become an autonomous platform;     - clearly defining the objectives and priorities of further RTD;     - designing new human-machine interaction devices;     - promoting an on-board automatic emergency call system (       eCall      ) as a harmonised and pan-European system similar to the E112 location-based emergency call number;     - closely monitoring progress made in the provision of real-time traffic and travel information (RTTI);       adapting the regulatory and standardisation provisions:       - removing legal barriers hampering time-limited use of short-range radar, in particular with regard to harmonised access to the radio spectrum in the EU;     - improving current legislation on EC vehicle type approval;     - inviting the European standardisation bodies to establish priorities and draw up a standardisation programme;       removing the societal and business obstacles:       - assessing the socio-economic benefits;     - supporting the compilation of the European code of good practice and carrying out cost-benefit analysis of intelligent car safety systems;     - promoting private and public sector road maps.     The Commission also intends to participate in the following actions       undertaken by the private sector      :      developing a methodology to assess the potential impact of introducing intelligent vehicle safety systems;       developing validation methodology and procedures for vehicles equipped with such systems;       defining, producing, maintaining and certifying a European digital map database with road safety attributes.      The Commission will support these activities through RTD financing instruments. The eSafety forum will monitor the implementation of the actions and recommendations of the working groups and submit reports on this activity.

act   Decision No  2241/2004/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 2004 on a single Community framework for the transparency of qualifications and competences (Europass).   summary   A standardised dossier setting out personal skills and qualifications, which is free and available electronically in 28 languages, can help citizens find work or receive training anywhere in Europe.   what does the decision do  The decision establishes a common European Union (EU) framework with the goal of enabling citizens to present their qualifications and competences clearly and easily through the creation of a personal, coordinated dossier of documents (Europass).   key points   The Europass is a portfolio of five documents and an electronic folder which can contain descriptions of a citizen’s learning achievements, official qualifications, work experience, skills and competences.  It contains the following elements:    Europass CV  - to illustrate the holder’s skills;    Europass mobility  - to record all periods of transnational mobility for learning purposes;    Europass diploma supplement  - to provide details on higher education courses completed;    Europass certificate supplement  - issued by competent national authorities to describe vocational qualifications;    Europass language passport  - to present linguistic and cultural skills;    European skills passport  - to improve the presentation of a CV by bringing together in one place the educational and training certificates declared in the CV.   The initiative is supported by an  internet portal  which allows citizens to draw up their own Europass CVs and language passports, and to find out about the other Europass documents.  The Europass should be consistent and complementary with the other instruments that promote European and international mobility, in particular:   the  European employment network  (EURES);   the European network of national information centres on recognition and university mobility (  ENIC-NARIC  ) established by the  Council of Europe  and  Unesco  .   A  2013 Commission report  found that Europass needed to become more flexible and user-friendly by exploiting the potential of modern technologies. It considered that the current structure should be made a simpler, more target-oriented and up-to-date service.

   Social services of general interest     Social services of general interest     This Communication is a further step towards taking into account the specific nature of social services at European level. It presents an open list of characteristics reflecting the specific nature of social services as services of general interest. It clarifies the conditions for applying Community rules to such services.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 26 April 2006, Implementing the Community Lisbon programme: Social services of general interest in the European Union [       COM(2006) 177      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The Member States are given the freedom to define services of general economic interest and particularly social services of general interest, and to define the obligations and missions relating to such services and their organisational principles. On the other hand, the Community framework requires Member States to take certain rules into account when they determine the arrangements for applying the objectives and principles they have established.     This Communication does not deal with health services. In document       COM(2006) 122      final, the Commission has undertaken to present a specific initiative for this field.     Social services occupy an important place within European society and the European economy.     Social services often contain one or more of the following organisational characteristics:      they operate on the basis of the solidarity principle;       they are comprehensive and personalised, integrating the response to differing needs in order to guarantee fundamental human rights and protect the most vulnerable;       they are not for profit;       they include the participation of voluntary workers;       they are strongly rooted in local cultural traditions. This finds its expression in particular in the proximity between the provider of the service and the beneficiary;       there is an asymmetric relationship between the provider and the beneficiaries of the service that cannot be assimilated to a 'normal' supplier/consumer relationship.      The social service sector, which is in the midst of expansion and experiencing increasing levels of competition, is undergoing a process of modernisation, which may take the following forms:      the introduction of benchmarking methods, quality assurance, and the involvement of users in administration;       the decentralisation of the organisation of these services to the local or regional level;       the outsourcing of public service tasks to the private sector, with the public authorities regulating competition;       the development of public-private partnerships and the use of other forms of funding to complement public funding.       The application of Community rules in the area of social services      The Member States must comply with Community law and the case-law of the Court of Justice when establishing the means of implementing the objectives and principles they have set themselves.     When services of an economic nature are involved, the Member States must ensure that their organisational arrangements are compatible with competition law in particular and also with the rules on the freedom to provide services and freedom of establishment.     The Communication focuses on the most common organisational arrangements:      the partial or complete delegation of a social mission by the public authorities to an external partner or the creation of a public-private partnership;       the granting of public financial compensation to external organisations carrying out a social task of general interest;        regulation of the market.       Analysis of the compatibility with Community law of the organisational arrangements for social services must be carried out on a case-by-case basis.      An in-depth consultation on the specific characteristics of social services      The European Commission intends to consult with all the actors involved, namely the Member States and the providers and users of the services. The consultation will look at:       the factors constituting these characteristics and their relevance to identifying the specific features of social services of general interest;        the ways for the Member States to take these features into consideration when defining tasks of general interest;        the experiences with applying Community law in the field of social services of general interest and the possible problems faced in this context;        how these characteristics could be considered by the Commission when checking compliance with the applicable Community rules.      In order to improve the mutual knowledge of operators and the Commission in matters relating to the application of Community rules and in order to deepen the exchange of information, a monitoring and dialogue procedure in the form of biennial reports will be established.     In early 2006, the Commission launched a study to collect the necessary information to draft the first biennial report. The information will concern the functioning of the sector, its socio-economic importance, as well as the implications of the application of Community law. The results of the study are expected by mid 2007.      Background      This Communication follows the       White Paper on services of general interest      and the       Social Agenda      , which announced a systematic approach to identify and recognise the specific characteristics of social and health services of general interest and to clarify the framework in which they operate and may be modernised. In March 2006, the European Council reiterated the need to maintain the European social model in the complex task of making the internal market for services fully operational.     RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission on the         Social Agenda        [         COM (2005) 33        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      The European Commission proposes a new social policy agenda for the period 2006-2010. The main objective of this new agenda is "a social Europe in the global economy: jobs and opportunities for all".      Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 12 May 2004 entitled "         White Paper on services of general interest        " [         COM(2004) 374        final - Not yet published in the Official Journal].      Presented as an extension of the Green Paper on services of general interest, the Commission White Paper describes the European Union's strategy for promoting the development of high-quality services of general interest. It presents the main elements of a strategy aimed at ensuring that all citizens and enterprises in the Union have access to high-quality and affordable services of general interest.      Commission         Green Paper        of 21 May 2003 on services of general interest [         COM(2003) 270        final - Official Journal C 76 of 25 March 2004].      The Commission, in this Green Paper, undertakes to conduct a complete review of its policies on services of general interest. Its objective is to organise an open debate on the overall role of the Union in the definition of the objectives of general interest pursued by these services and on how they are organised, funded and evaluated. The Green Paper reaffirms the significant contribution of the internal market and competition rules to modernising and improving the quality and effectiveness of many public services, to the benefit of Europe's citizens and businesses. It also deals with globalisation and liberalisation, raising the question of whether a general legislative framework should be established at Community level for services of general interest.

summary of   Directive (EU) 2016/2341 — activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision   what is the aim of this directive  It sets out minimum harmonisation rules for institutions managing collective retirement schemes for employers on behalf of their employees. EU governments may introduce further measures they consider necessary.  The rules aim to:   ensure occupational pension schemes are financially sound;   give greater protection and information to members and beneficiaries;   remove obstacles to cross-border fund activity;   encourage long-term and responsible investment.   The legislation  revises  and replaces Directive  2003/41/EC  , which needed to be updated after the 2008 financial crisis.   key points   EU countries must ensure that occupational pension funds or institutions for occupational retirement provision (IORPs):   are only involved in retirement-benefit activities;   safeguard their assets for members and beneficiaries if a partner organisation goes bankrupt;   are registered and authorised by the relevant national authority, including for cross-border activities;   have sufficient funds to cover their financial commitments;   invest prudently in the best long-term interest of members and beneficiaries;   operate an effective governance system that provides sound and prudent management of their activities;   are run by people with the suitable expertise, qualifications and knowledge;   apply a sound remuneration policy for all employees;   have risk management, internal audit and actuarial functions  *  in place;   at least every 3 years carry out an internal risk assessment and provide a written statement of their investment policy principles;   draw up and publicly disclose annual accounts;   are subject to prudential supervision on issues such as solvency margins and investment rules.   The relevant national authorities in the EU countries:   must have the resources necessary to exercise the prudential supervision;   require IORPs to have sound administrative, accounting and internal control mechanisms;   may impose administrative and other penalties for any breaches of legislation;   have the power to review an IORP’s strategies, processes and reporting procedures, obtain internal documents they may require and conduct on-site inspections;   may exchange information with each other and monetary authorities without violating professional secrecy conditions.   IORPs must provide prospective and actual members and beneficiaries with clear, updated and free information. This includes:   details of the IORP itself and members’ rights and obligations;   pension benefit statements containing, for instance, data on contributions paid, a breakdown of costs and the value of the personal scheme;   advice on how to obtain supplementary information;   pre-retirement advice on benefit pay-out options.   Depending on the requirements in question, EU countries may exempt certain funds which operate pension schemes with fewer than 15 or 100 members from certain conditions of the legislation. In the event that a pension fund wishes to provide its services in other EU countries, however, it has to apply all the rules laid down in the directive.  The  European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority  :   helps cooperation between national authorities;   ensures consistent application of EU insurance and occupational pensions legislation.   The  European Commission  must report to the  European Parliament  and to the  Council  on the implementation of the legislation by 13 January 2023.   from when does the directive apply  The directive entered into force on 12 January 2017. It has to become law in the EU countries by 13 January 2019 and it will apply from the date of national transposition.   background   Occupational pensions include contributions from employers. They are the ‘second pillar’ of the pension system. State-based social security pensions are the ‘first pillar’. The ‘third pillar’ consists of individuals’ non-compulsory private pension savings.  Under EU rules, funds in one country can manage occupational pension schemes for companies based in another. Pan-EU companies can also have a single pension fund for all their European subsidiaries.  Some 125,000 occupational funds operate across the EU. They hold assets worth €2.5 trillion on behalf of around 75 million citizens, representing 20% of the EU’s working-age population.  For more information, see:    Revision of the Occupational Pension Funds Directive – frequently asked questions  — press release (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Actuarial functions:  defined in Article 48 of Directive 2009/138/EC (Solvency II), it covers (i) the coordination and monitoring of technical rules, including methodology, assumptions and data; (ii) reporting; and (iii) supporting the risk-management function.
summary of   Regulation (EC) No 1185/2009 — statistics on pesticides   what is the aim of this regulation   It sets up rules and procedures for the collection and dissemination of statistics on the  sales and use of pesticides  .   These statistics, together with other relevant data, will allow the EU countries to draw up the  national action plans  with quantitative objectives, targets, measures and timetables, envisaged in Directive  2009/128/EC  and aimed at reducing the risks and impacts of pesticide use on human health and the environment.   They are also necessary for assessing EU policies on  sustainable development  and for calculating relevant  indicators on the risks  for health and the environment related to pesticide use.   key points    Scope   The statistics apply to:   the annual amounts of pesticides placed for sale on the market in accordance with the regulation’s Annex I;   the annual amounts of pesticides used in accordance with the regulation’s Annex II.    Data collection, transmission and processing   EU countries must collect the data necessary for the specification of the characteristics listed in Annex I on an annual basis and for those listed in Annex II in 5-year periods by means of:   surveys;   information concerning the  placing on the market and use of pesticides  taking into account, in particular, the obligations laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009;   administrative sources; or   a combination of these means, including statistical estimation procedures on the basis of expert judgments or models.   They must then transmit the results to the  European Commission  (Eurostat) in line with the  schedules  and the  frequency  laid down in the regulation’s annexes. They must present the data in accordance with the  classification  in Annex III and the  technical format  set out in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1264/2014.  Any  confidential data  must be used by national authorities and by the Commission (  Eurostat  ) exclusively for statistical purposes, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 on the  development, production and dissemination of European statistics  .   Quality assessment   EU countries submit reports to the Commission (Eurostat) on the quality of the data submitted. The Commission (Eurostat) also assesses the quality of the data.   Implementing measures and committee   The regulation grants the Commission power to adopt further legislation for implementation purposes. The Commission regularly adapts the list of active substances to be covered and their classification in categories of products and chemical classes, as set out on the regulation’s Annex III. The Commission is assisted and advised by the  European Statistical System Committee  , which comprises national experts.   Report   Every 5 years, the Commission with report to the  European Parliament  and the  Council  on the regulation’s implementation. Besides evaluating the quality of the data transmitted, the report will review the data collection methods, the burden on businesses, agricultural holdings and national administrations, as well as the usefulness of the statistics in meeting the regulation’s objectives. The Commission published its first  report  in 2017.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 30 December 2009.   background   For more information, see:    Pesticide sales statistics  (  Eurostat  ).
summary of   Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 laying down measures concerning open internet access   what is the aim of the regulation  It aims to introduce rules to safeguard open internet access and abolish retail roaming surcharges for customers while travelling in the EU.   key points   The regulation:   introduces rules to safeguard  equal and non-discriminatory treatment of internet traffic  (net neutrality);   sets up a  new pricing mechanism to regulate mobile roaming services EU-wide  , abolishing surcharges without distorting the market in the home or visited country.   The regulation amends Directive 2002/22/EC on  universal service and users’ rights  relating to electronic communications  networks  and  services  , and Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 on  roaming on public mobile communications networks  within the EU.   Open internet access   Internet providers will be required to treat all traffic equally when providing internet access services:   without discrimination, restriction or interference; and   irrespective of:   the sender and receiver;   the content accessed or distributed; or   the applications or services used.     Providers are allowed to use reasonable  traffic-management measures  , but these must be transparent, non-discriminatory, proportionate and not be based on commercial considerations.   Traffic-management measures  must not monitor  specific content  and must not be in place any longer than necessary. Measures going beyond such reasonable traffic management (for example, blocking or throttling) are prohibited, except for a limited number of cases defined in the regulation.  Agreements on  services requiring a specific level of quality are allowed  , provided they are not a replacement for internet access and do not reduce the availability or quality of the internet access services.  Internet access service providers should  inform customers  about:   how  traffic-management  practices and other services could impact the quality of internet access;   the internet  speed  normally available and the remedies available to users in case of non-compliance.    Roaming charges   A roaming provider must provide roaming services at domestic prices to customers who are normally resident in the EU country of that roaming provider while they are travelling in the EU.  Customers pay domestic prices for phone calls, SMS and mobile internet, irrespective of where they are travelling in the EU. Regulation on  roaming charges  within the EU is amended,  abolishing roaming surcharges  in the EU on 15 June 2017 except as follows:   roaming providers can prevent  abusive or anomalous use  of roaming services at domestic prices by applying a  surcharge  not higher than the maximum wholesale roaming charges, once ‘  fair use  ’ has been exceeded;   in exceptional and specific circumstances, in order to  ensure that domestic pricing is sustainable  , a roaming provider may be allowed by the national regulatory authority to apply a surcharge to recover the cost of providing roaming services to its customers.   As long as a customer travels periodically and spends more time in their home country than abroad in any 4-month period, they can fully benefit from the new rules.  Roaming providers must be transparent about tariffs. In particular, roaming customers must be notified, in a timely manner and free of charge, where the ‘fair use’ policy applies, when voice, SMS or data roaming services have been fully used up. This includes notification of any surcharge as well as roaming data consumption.  The  European Commission  will review the regulation at the latest by December 2019, after consulting  BEREC  .   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 30 April 2016. Roaming charges were abolished from 15 June 2017.   background   For further information, see:    Open Internet: net neutrality  (  European Commission  )    Roaming  (  European Commission  )    Guidelines on the Implementation by National Regulators of European Net Neutrality Rules  (  BEREC  ).
summary of   Regulation (EC) No 1692/2006 establishing the Marco Polo II programme for granting EU financial assistance to improve the environmental performance of the freight transport system   what is the aim of the regulation   The Marco Polo II programme was designed to shift freight from the road to more environmentally friendly means of transport and to increase efficiency of transport operations by avoiding unnecessary traffic and empty runs.   The programme aimed at enhancing intermodality  *  by making better use in the transport system of the existing resources by incorporating short-sea shipping and rail and river transport into the logistics chain.   The regulation repeals Regulation (EC) No  1382/2003  , which set up the first Marco Polo programme.   key points    The Marco Polo II programme was in force from 2007 to 2013, as a successor to the Marco Polo I (2003-2006) and PACT (1997-2001) programmes.   The programme was conceived to provide operational support to transport and logistics entities in view of addressing market failures causing imbalances and inefficiencies in the European freight transport sector, especially due to the dominant position of the road transport.   Its main objectives were to  reduce congestion  and to  improve the environmental performance  of the freight transport system. It thereby contributed to an efficient and sustainable transport system which provides EU added value without having a negative impact on economic, social or territorial cohesion.   Most of the project types were assessed and paid on the basis of quantifiable results, such as a modal shift actually being achieved and freight traffic being avoided in the European transport network.   Marco Polo II allowed for a  wider geographical coverage  by supporting actions operated not only between the EU countries but also between at least one EU country and a nearby non-EU country.   A total budget of €435 million was made available to fund five types of action:   modal shift,   catalyst,   common learning,   motorways of the sea, and   traffic avoidance.     The actions were selected through yearly calls for proposals.   All actions funded under the Marco Polo II programme have been completed and the programme has come to its end.   Two executive agencies were managing the programme: Executive Agency for Competitiveness and Innovation until the end of 2013 and  Innovation and Networks Executive Agency  as of 2014 to its closure.   In 2013, the Commission published a  communication  on the results of the Marco Polo programmes for the period 2003 to 2010.    Eligible actions   The following actions were eligible.    Catalyst actions  : actions aimed at overcoming significant structural barriers in the EU freight transport market which impede the efficient functioning of the markets, the competitiveness of  short sea shipping  , rail or inland waterway transport, and/or the efficiency of transport chains which make use of these modes. They are aimed at  improving synergies  in the rail, inland waterway and short sea shipping sectors, including  motorways of the sea  , by  making better use of existing infrastructure  .    Modal shift actions  : actions aimed at shifting freight from road to short sea shipping, rail, inland waterways or a combination of modes of transport. The objective is to  keep road journeys as short as possible  .    Common learning actions  : actions aimed at improving cooperation for structurally optimising working methods and procedures in the freight transport chain, taking the requirements of logistics into account.    Motorways of the sea  : an idea first introduced by the  2001 White Paper on European transport policy  . Motorways of the sea are aimed at directly shifting a proportion of freight from road to short sea shipping or a combination of short sea shipping and other modes of transport in which road journeys are as short as possible. For example, motorways of the sea could be established between Spain and France to eliminate the road traffic bottleneck in the Pyrenees.    Traffic avoidance actions  : any innovative action aimed at integrating transport into the production logistics of businesses to avoid a large percentage of freight transport by road without adversely affecting production output or workforce capability.    Selection criteria of submitted proposals    Actions must be submitted by undertakings or consortia established in EU countries or participating countries, which includes  candidate countries  for EU accession and  European Free Trade Association  ,  European Economic Area  and close non-EU countries subject to certain conditions.   EU financial assistance had the form of grants. For most project types, it was based on the  number of tonne-kilometres transferred  from the road to other means of sea or land transport or the number of vehicle-kilometres of road freight avoided. The objective was to  reward high-quality projects  . The EU grant could not lead to any distortions of competition.   The programme pays special attention to  sensitive and metropolitan areas  . The Commission evaluates the actions submitted, taking account of their contribution to reducing road congestion, but also their relative environmental merits and their overall sustainability.    EU financial assistance  for the various actions is limited to a maximum of  35% of the total expenditure  necessary to achieve the objectives of the action and incurred as a result of it. In the case of  common learning actions  , the ceiling is  50%  .   background   For more information, see:    Marco Polo programme  (  Innovation and Networks Executive Agency  ).   key terms    Intermodality:  Intermodality, also known as multimodality, is a quality indicator of the level of integration between the different transport modes. More intermodality means more integration and complementarity between modes, which provides scope for a more efficient use of the transport system.
   Agreements with the countries of the Western Balkans on the facilitation of the issuance of visas     Agreements with the countries of the Western Balkans on the facilitation of the issuance of visas     The agreements concluded between the European Union (EU) and the countries of the Western Balkans on facilitating the issuance of visas are intended to simplify and speed up the procedures for issuing visas to nationals of these Western Balkan countries. These agreements are, in principle, coupled with readmission agreements.     ACT      Council Decision         2007/821/EC        of 8 November 2007 on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Albania on the facilitation of the issuance of visas.       Council Decision         2007/822/EC        of 8 November 2007 on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and Bosnia and Herzegovina on the facilitation of the issuance of visas.       Council Decision         2007/823/EC        of 8 November on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Montenegro on the facilitation of the issuance of visas.       Council Decision         2007/824/EC        of 8 November 2007 on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on the facilitation of the issuance of visas.       Council Decision         2007/825/EC        of 8 November 2007 on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Serbia on the facilitation of the issuance of visas.      SUMMARY     The agreements concluded with Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ("partner countries") are intended to facilitate the issuance of short-stay visas to citizens of these countries for stays of       up to 90 days      per period of 180 days.     When applying for such short-stay visas, citizens of these partner countries benefit from       simplified document requirements      for justifying the purpose of their journey to the European Union (EU). The documentary evidence to be presented consists of formal documents, such as a written request from the host organisation or other certificate, depending on the category of the applicant (business people, drivers for international transportation services, journalists, students, persons travelling for tourism or for medical reasons, representatives of civil society organisations, etc.).     EU countries’ diplomatic missions and consular posts may issue       multiple-entry visas      that are valid for up to five years to: members of the governments, parliaments, constitutional courts and supreme courts of partner countries; permanent members of official delegations; spouses and children under the age of 21 visiting citizens of partner countries legally residing in the territory of an EU country. The categories of persons who benefit from simplified document requirements may also be granted multiple-entry visas with a maximum validity period of one year. However, the person concerned must have obtained and used at least one visa during the previous year and have valid reasons for requesting a multiple-entry visa. If such a person has made use of the one-year multiple-entry visa during the previous two years, s/he may be granted a multiple-entry visa that is valid a minimum of two and a maximum of five years.     The       standard fee      for processing visa applications of partner countries’ citizens is 35 euros. This is waived for certain categories of persons, including close relatives, members of official delegations, students, disabled persons, children under the age of six, journalists, pensioners and drivers for international transportation services.     Visas are issued within       10 days      of the receipt of the application. This may be extended to up to 30 days when further scrutiny of the application is needed or may be reduced to 3 days or even less in emergencies.      Background      The participants at the EU-Western Balkans Summit held in Thessaloniki on 21 June 2003 ("Thessaloniki Agenda") agreed on the principle of liberalisation of the visa regime and began negotiations with a view to concluding the necessary agreements. This process, coupled with discussions on the conclusion of       readmission agreements      , resulted on 8 November 2007 in the adoption of a series of Council decisions, one for each of the partner countries, establishing the conclusion of agreements based on Article 62, taken in conjunction with Article 300, of the Treaty establishing the European Community (now Articles 77 and 218 respectively of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union).

   Market abuse     Market abuse     This Directive is intended to guarantee the integrity of European financial markets and increase investor confidence. The objective is to create a level playing field for all economic operators in the Member States as part of the effort to combat market abuse.     ACT     Directive       2003/6/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 on insider dealing and market manipulation (market abuse) [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     This Directive aims at preventing market abuse in order to preserve the smooth functioning of European Union financial markets.     This Directive does not apply to transactions relating to:      monetary policy, exchange rates or public debt management by a Member State;       the European System of Central Banks;       national central banks.       Conditions for the prohibition of market abuse      Market abuse may arise in circumstances where investors have been unreasonably disadvantaged, directly or indirectly, by others who:      have used information which is not publicly available (insider dealing);       have distorted the price-setting mechanism of financial instruments;       have disseminated false or misleading information.      This type of conduct can undermine the general principle that all investors must be placed on an equal footing.     The Member States therefore prohibit any person possessing information from:      disclosing privileged information to any other person outside the scope of the exercise of their employment;       recommending any other person to acquire or dispose of financial instruments to which that information relates;       engaging in market manipulation.      These prohibitions do not apply either to trading in own shares in “buy-back” programmes or to the stabilisation of a financial instrument.      Managing information from the issuers of financial instruments      The issuers of financial instruments must publish information which concerns the said issuers as soon as possible and post it on their website. If an issuer discloses privileged information to a third party in the exercise of his duties, he must make public disclosure of that information.     Issuers must also draw up a list of persons in their employment who have access to privileged information.     The       European Securities and Markets Authority      (ESMA) may draft technical norms for implementation aimed at ensuring that acts adopted by the Commission are applied under uniform conditions.      Cooperation      The Directive requires each Member State to designate a single regulatory and supervisory authority with a common minimum set of responsibilities. These authorities use convergent methods to combat market abuse and should be able to assist each other in taking action against infringements, particularly in cross-border cases. The administrative cooperation procedure followed could in particular help to combat terrorist acts. The competent authorities are to collaborate with the ESMA.      Penalties      The same form of wrongful conduct shall incur the same penalty in each of the Member States.     If a competent authority adopts an administrative measure or penalty, it must inform the ESMA. If said penalty concerns an investment firm authorised pursuant to the       Markets in Financial Instruments Directive      (MiFiD), the ESMA shall add a reference to that penalty in the register of investment firms.

This           consolidated version          is for reference purpose only.       RELATED ACTS      Directive         2008/26/EC        of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2008 amending Directive 2003/6/EC on insider dealing and market manipulation (market abuse), as regards the implementing powers conferred on the Commission [Official Journal L 81 of 20.3.2008].       Commission Directive         2004/72/EC        of 29 April 2004 implementing Directive 2003/6/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards accepted market practices, the definition of inside information in relation to derivatives on commodities, the drawing up of lists of insiders, the notification of managers' transactions and the notification of suspicious transactions [Official Journal L 162, 30.04.2004].      This Directive defines the criteria to be taken into account when evaluating market practices for the purpose of implementing Article 6(10) of Directive 2003/6/EC. The practices of market participants must comply with the principles of fairness and efficiency in order to protect the integrity of the market. These practices must not compromise the integrity of other European Union markets that are linked to it.      Commission Directive         2003/124/EC        of 22 December 2003 implementing Directive 2003/6/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the definition and public disclosure of inside information and the definition of market manipulation [Official Journal L 339, 24.12.2003].      This Directive fixes the detailed criteria for determining information that must be deemed to be of a precise nature and likely to have a significant effect on prices. In addition, it specifies a series of factors that are to be taken into consideration in determining whether specific behaviour constitutes market manipulation. Regarding issuers, it lays down the means and time-limits for public disclosure of inside information and the precise circumstance in which they are authorised to delay such public disclosure in order to protect their legitimate interests.      Commission Directive         2003/125/EC        of 22 December 2003 implementing Directive 2003/6/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the fair presentation of investment recommendations and the disclosure of conflicts of interest [Official Journal L 339, 24.12.2003].      This Directive fixes the rules for the fair presentation of investment recommendations and the disclosure of conflicts of interest. It draws a distinction between persons producing investment recommendations (who must meet stricter standards) and those disseminating recommendations made by third parties. Under Article 6 of the Directive on market abuse, this second implementing Directive must take into account the rules, including self-regulation, governing the profession of journalist. This means that the highly specialised subcategory of financial journalists who produce or disseminate investment recommendations must respect certain general principles. Nevertheless, protective measures are provided for and the use of self-regulatory mechanisms is authorised in order to determine how those basic principles must be applied. The aim of this arrangement is to preserve the freedom of the press while protecting investors and issuers against any risk of market manipulation by journalists.     Last updated: 01.04.2011  
   Croatia – Education and culture     Croatia – Education and culture     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM(2010) 660      final – SEC(2010) 1326 - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     In its       2010 Report      , the Commission regrets that Croatia has not made additional progress in the areas of education, training, youth and culture. However, the country has achieved an adequate level of alignment and future effort should essentially focus on preparing the country to participate in European Union programmes.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission's words)      Education, training and youth is primarily the competence of the Member States. The EC Treaty provides that the Community will contribute to the development of quality education and implement a vocational training policy that supports and supplements the action of Member States. The       acquis      consists of a directive on education of the children of migrant workers, and of action programmes and recommendations. Member States need to have the necessary implementing capacity in place to effectively participate in the Community programmes related to this chapter.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission's words)      Further progress has been made regarding the       acquis      in the area of       education and culture      . There is a good level of alignment.     Croatia needs to continue its efforts to prepare for the       management of the Lifelong Learning and Youth in Action Programmes      .     RELATED ACTS      Commission Report [         COM(2009) 533        final – SEC(2009) 1333 final – Not published in the Official Journal].      The October 2009 report noted that Croatia had made good progress, in particular in aligning with the Community       acquis      as well as in partially meeting its Accession Partnership priorities. Nevertheless, additional efforts were needed with regard to the management of Community programmes and adult education.      Commission Report [         COM(2008) 674        final – SEC(2008) 2694 final – Not published in the Official Journal].      The November 2008 report noted encouraging progress with regard to respect for the Accession Partnership priorities in the field of education, training and youth. Preparations for the management of the programmes were to be continued.      Commission Report [         COM(2007) 663        final – SEC(2007) 1431 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The November 2007 report noted the continuation of the education reform process and Croatia’s good level of alignment with the       acquis      . Efforts remained to be made regarding non-discrimination between EU and Croatian nationals in secondary education and the application of the directive on education of children of migrant workers.      Commission Report [         COM(2006) 649        final – SEC(2006) 1385 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The November 2006 report noted that Croatia had made reasonable progress, particularly in continuing with its reforms, and had achieved a good level of preparation for implementing the       acquis      . However, it had to put in place the management capacity and infrastructure needed to manage the Community programmes in which it participates. It also had to continue its efforts to guarantee non-discrimination between EU and Croatian nationals.      Commission Report [         COM(2005) 561        final - SEC(2005) 1424 - Not published in the Official Journal].      The October 2005 report noted that several measures had been taken in connection with the reform of the education and training system, particularly in the area of higher education with the introduction of the Bologna process in study programmes. Croatia’s system of vocational education and training needed substantial improvement. It needed to be based on a coherent national policy approach and pay greater heed to youth policy.      Commission Opinion [         COM(2004) 257        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      In its opinion of April 2004, the European Commission concluded that Croatia should not encounter any major problems in the field of education and training in the medium term. It would, however, have to make a considerable effort to create a modern vocational education and training system in line with the European Union’s (EU) employment and social policies.

summary of   Decision 93/98/EEC — approval by the European Community of the Basel Convention    Basel Convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal   what is the aim of the decision and of the convention  The decision approves on behalf of the European Economic Community (now the EU) the Basel Convention.  The convention is the most comprehensive global environmental agreement on hazardous wastes and other wastes. It aims to protect human health and the environment from the adverse effects resulting from the generation, the transboundary (crossing borders) movement and the management of hazardous wastes and other wastes.  The convention regulates the transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and other wastes and requires its parties to ensure that they manage and dispose of such wastes in an environmentally sound manner.  The parties also undertake to:   minimise the quantities that are transported;   treat and dispose of the wastes as close as possible to their place of generation;   prevent or minimise the generation of wastes at source.   key points    Scope   The convention has 8 annexes:    Annex I:  Categories of wastes to be controlled — ranging from clinical wastes to wastes from the production, formulation and use of organic solvents;    Annex II:  Categories of wastes requiring special consideration — wastes collected from households and residues arising from the incineration of household wastes;    Annex III:  List of hazardous characteristics — such as whether they are explosive, flammable liquids or solids, liable to spontaneous combustion, corrosive or ecotoxic (harmful to the environment);    Annex IV:  List of disposal  *  operations;    Annex V A:  Information to be provided on notification;    Annex V B:  Information to be provided on the movement document;    Annex VI:  Arbitration;    Annex VII:  (not in force);    Annex VIII:  List of wastes.    General obligations of the convention   Parties agree the following:   not to export (or import) hazardous wastes or other wastes to (or from) a non-signatory state;   not to export waste unless the state of import has given its  prior consent  in writing to the specific import;   to communicate information about  proposed international movements  to the states concerned by means of a  notification form  ; this will allow them to evaluate the effects of hazardous waste or other wastes on human health and the environment;   to permit international movements of wastes only where there is  no danger  with regard to their movement and disposal;   to  package, label and transport  the wastes that are moved in line with  international rules  , and to ensure they are accompanied by a  movement document  from the point at which movement starts to the point of disposal.   Any party may impose  additional requirements  that are consistent with the convention.   Notification procedures   The convention introduces  notification procedures  with regard to:   international movements between parties;   international movements from a party through the territory of non-signatory states.    Illegal shipments   Where wastes are illegally exported, parties to the convention must re-import them.   Environmentally sound management   Parties agree to work together on environmentally sound practices for the management of hazardous and other wastes.   Dispute settlement   Parties should settle any disputes through negotiation or any other peaceful means of their choice. If a solution is not found, the dispute is submitted to the  International Court of Justice  or to an arbitration tribunal consisting of 3 parties.   Secretariat   A  secretariat  facilitates cooperation and the sharing of information among parties.   Capacity-building   Regional or sub-regional centres around the globe provide  training and capacity-building  .   Implementing legislation   The convention has been incorporated into EU law by means of Regulation (EC) No  1013/2006  and its subsequent amendments.   from when do the decision and the convention apply  The decision has applied since 1 February 1993. The convention has applied since 8 May 1994.   background   The EU, in addition to the EU countries, is a party to the convention. The EU has ratified the ban amendment which prohibits exports of waste to non-OECD countries, although this amendment has not yet entered into force internationally.  The convention was negotiated under the auspices of the  United Nations Environment Programme  and was adopted in 1989.

   Global partnership for sustainable development     Global partnership for sustainable development     This communication highlights how the European Union contributes to global sustainable development and the action aimed at establishing a global deal for sustainable development.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, of 21 February 2002, entitled: "Towards a global partnership for sustainable development" [       COM(2002) 82      final - Not published in Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The European Union (EU) established a       strategy for sustainable development      in May 2001. In endorsing this strategy, the Göteborg European Council recognised that the external dimension needed to be further developed. It also called on the Commission to consider the Union's contribution to global sustainable development. This communication responds to this request and contributes to developing the EU's position in relation to the World Summit on sustainable development, which was held in Johannesburg in 2002.     The communication takes as its starting point the idea that globalisation acts as a powerful force for sustaining global growth and providing ways of dealing with international problems such as health, education and the environment. However, left to develop unchecked, market forces cause and exacerbate inequality and exclusion and can cause irreparable damage to the environment. Globalisation must therefore go hand in hand with measures designed to prevent or mitigate these effects. In the crucial spheres of trade, development financing, environmental management and combating poverty and crime, it is essential that efforts be made to draw up joint rules which are implemented and monitored effectively. It is also necessary to improve global governance, i.e. to promote more efficient management of interdependence.     The communication presents a series of actions to contribute to global sustainable development. They complement the May 2001 strategy for sustainable development and cover economic, social, environmental and financial aspects, as well as coherence of Community policies and governance at all levels.      Harnessing globalisation: trade for sustainable development      To ensure that globalisation contributes to sustainable development, the specific economic activities set out by the Commission are as follows:      within the framework of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), to improve the integration of developing countries into the world economy;       to help developing countries benefit from the global trading system;       to change the         generalised system of preferences        (GSP) to take account of sustainable development;       to include sustainable development in the bilateral and regional agreements;       to reduce the non-transparent use of the international financial system and to regulate it more efficiently;        to encourage European businesses to be socially responsible        ;       to promote cooperation between the WTO and international environmental organisations.       Fighting poverty and promoting social development      The aim is to reduce extreme poverty in the world by 2015 (people who live on $ 1 a day or less). Consequently, the quality, quantity, impact and sustainability of development cooperation must be increased. The activities to be carried out in this field are as follows:      to focus EU development policy on poverty reduction;       to ensure that EU policies contribute to combating hunger;       to integrate water distribution and treatment policies with health and education policies;       to mainstream the gender perspective in EU policies;       to invest more in the fields of health, education, training and communicable diseases;       to promote research relating to sustainable development.       Sustainable management of natural and environmental resources      The objective in this field is to reverse the trend of the loss of environmental resources by 2015 as well as to develop intermediate objectives in the sectors of water, land and soil, energy and biodiversity. The specific activities set out are as follows:      at the Johannesburg World Summit, to launch an initiative to promote sustainable water resource management;       to launch an initiative on cooperation in the field of         energy and development        ;       to promote the application of international environmental agreements;       to partially replenish the Global Environment Facility;       to draw up an action plan to combat         illegal logging        ;       to invest in sustainable modes of transport;       to promote sustainable fishing;       to deal with the prevention of natural disasters;       to extend the         Global Monitoring for Environment and Security        (GMES) system to developing countries.       Improving the coherence of European Union policies      The aim is to integrate sustainable development into all EU policies. The activities to be implemented are as follows:      to establish a system to assess the economic, social and environmental impact of all major policy proposals of the Union;       to continue the process of adapting policies to the objectives of sustainable development;       to sign the United Nations Protocol on the Illicit Manufacturing and Trafficking of Firearms;       to combat the negative effects of emigration.       Better governance at all levels      This area deals with strengthening the participation of civil society, and the legitimacy, coherence and effectiveness of global economic, social and environmental governance. The communication proposes the following specific action:      strengthening public institutions and civil society in developing countries;       stepping up the fight against corruption;       ensuring that core labour standards are respected;       at the Johannesburg Summit, encouraging the adoption of decisions which improve global governance;       stepping up the fight against         discrimination against women        .       Financing sustainable development       The objectives are those of the Millennium Declaration      , namely: to eradicate poverty and hunger; to achieve universal primary education; to promote gender equality; to reduce child mortality; to improve women's health; to combat communicable diseases; to promote sustainable development; and to develop a global partnership. The suggested actions are:      to make progress towards achieving the target of allocating official development assistance of 0.7 % of GNI (gross national income) and achieving the intermediate target of at least 0.33 % of GNI for all countries of the European Union from 2006;        to reduce the debt of the heavily indebted poor countries        ;       to take part in the debate on the possibility of States offering global public goods.      RELATED ACTS      Joint declaration by the Council and the representatives of the governments of the Member States meeting within the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission on the development policy of the European Union, entitled         The European Consensus        [Official Journal C 46/01 of 24 February 2006].      In this declaration, the European Union reaffirms that the objective of its development policy is to reduce poverty worldwide in the context of sustainable development.     Last updated: 26.09.2007  
summary of   Communication (COM(2003) 811 final) — dialogue with associations of regional and local authorities on the formulation of EU policy   what is the aim of this communication   It seeks to formalise a systematic dialogue  *  between the  European Commission  and the local and regional authorities in the preparation of new EU policies.   This dialogue underpins the importance and status of local and regional authorities in the EU.   key points   This communication:   stresses that this systematic dialogue is in addition to all the other online consultation approaches to which local and regional authorities and their associations (such as the  Council of European Municipalities and Regions — CEMR  , the  Conference of peripheral maritime regions  and  Eurocities  ) respond;   sets out clearly the role that the  Committee of the Regions (CoR)  plays in the systematic dialogue;   draws up a set of criteria to identify the associations that may participate in the dialogue.    Subsequent developments    In 2012, the CoR and the European Commission, signed a  renewed cooperation agreement  (protocol) that promoted a territorial dialogue through the Committee of the Regions with local and regional authorities as a way of further involving them in the EU policy-making process.   The protocol recognises the benefit of CoR platforms and networks as an access point to local and regional authorities. They permit the Commission to broaden its analysis of local and regional aspects in impact assessments where necessary.   In 2015, the Commission published its  agenda for better regulation   *  . This underpins its approach to open, transparent and better consultation on new and existing legislation through expert groups, the REFIT platform  *  and the regulatory scrutiny board that oversees impact assessments. The CoR is now represented in the  REFIT platform  .   background    The principles of  subsidiarity  and  proportionality  are recognised in  Article 5  of the Treaty on European Union, as well as in Articles 2, 5 and 6 of  Protocol No 2 on the application of the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity  .   Since the adoption of the communication, the EU has been enlarged on 3 occasions. It now comprises 28 countries and more than 92,506 sub-national governments including   91,252 municipalities,   935 intermediary level sub-national governments and   319 regional or federated level sub-national governments.     * key terms     Systematic dialogue:  a process to ensure that local and regional authority input can be secured throughout the policy development process.

   Action plan to combat drugs (1995-1999)     Action plan to combat drugs (1995-1999)     1) OBJECTIVE     To establish general guidelines for future Union measures to combat drugs.     2) ACT     Communication to the Council and the European Parliament on a European Union Action Plan to combat drugs (1996-2000) [       COM(94) 234      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     3) SUMMARY      Characteristics      A global multi-annual (1996-2000) action plan under which the Union will implement a global strategy to combat drugs, aimed at reducing demand, combating illicit drug trafficking and taking action against non-member countries involved in the production and transit of drugs.     This plan is an extension of the first two European plans preceding the entry into force of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), which were approved by the European Councils in Rome (December 1990) and Edinburgh (December 1992).     The structure of the Action Plan is as follows:     a) Reducing demand     Pursuant to Article 152 (formerly Article 129) of the TEU, the Community action programme on drug addiction aims to encourage and facilitate activities involving high-risk groups in particular situations, to promote the identification, development, testing and use of the best methods to ensure the dissemination of information, to promote education and training initiatives with the aim of developing strategies for prevention, to support work on early detection and on advice for drug users and to promote social rehabilitation and reintegration.     b) Combating trafficking     The new action plan proposes to develop and consolidate existing Community legislation and to implement Title VI of the TEU. Results have been obtained at Community level as a result on the one hand of measures carried out in combating the diversion of precursors and psychotropic substances and, on the other, of the Directive on "money laundering". The Commission advocates reinforcing this activity by using existing instruments (development of electronic mail networks to speed up the exchange of information, etc.), by promoting cooperation with non-member countries (taking Community legislation and other international agreements as a model) and by assessing the practical implementation of these measures.     Title VI (cooperation in the fields of justice and home affairs) introduces a new obligation for Member States of the Union to cooperate on matters of common interest in judicial, customs and police affairs (Article K.1.7, 8) and 9)). EUROPOL, once established, is to focus its activity initially on combating drug trafficking.     Pursuant to Article K.1.4, aimed at combating drug addiction, the Commission is formulating suggestions with a view to complementing measures currently in progress, namely:      interdisciplinary exchanges between professionals and organisations responsible for reducing drug supply and demand;       establishment of a European forum for inter-city exchanges and cooperation;       cooperation in the area of the relationship between drugs and criminality.      c. International measures     The EU is to supplement its action plan by initiatives outside the Union, making use of Community instruments and of the new opportunities offered by the CFSP (common foreign and security policy). At Community level, measures should involve the following areas:      continued EU participation in international efforts (UN international drug monitoring programme, the Pompidou Group of the Council of Europe, etc);       at the bilateral level, reinforcing national and regional strategies in cooperation witih certain countries or regions representing a particular risk due to their proximity to the Union;       development of cooperation by including clauses relating to combating drugs in EU agreements with non-member countries;       including cooperation in combating drugs among the priorities in terms of commercial and development policy (e.g. recourse to GSP or the Lomé Convention).      The CFSP will enable the EU to lend its political and diplomatic weight to commercial and development cooperation mechanisms already in place. In addition, the Council has identified the combating of illicit drug trafficking as an appropriate field for joint action, targeting the Maghreb and the Middle East as priority areas in this context. The Communication suggests that action under the CFSP may take the form of joint positions intended to ensure increased international cooperation and joint measures intended to support Community efforts aimed at strengthening the ability of non-member countries to play a full part in combating drugs.     d. Coordination     The Communication stresses the importance of maintaining and improving coordination at both Member State and EU level, particularly in the following contexts:      Coordination within and between Member States (national coordinators and the Permanent Representatives' Committee ought to have an important role to play);       The European Drugs Monitoring Centre in Lisbon will be able to contribute to the political decision-making process through its important role in information and analysis, in liaison with its associated network of national centres;       Multidisciplinary aspects (information, research and training are considered priorities).       4) implementing measures       5) follow-up work        Communication of 26 May 1999 from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, on a European Union Action Plan to Combat Drugs (           2000-2004          ) [           COM(1999) 239          final - Not published in the Official Journal].        Following on from the European Councils in Cardiff (June 1998) and Vienna (December 1998), the Commission and the Parliament have been called on to draw up a new, comprehensive anti-drug strategy to replace the 1995-1999 action plan.

   Online learning: eLearning Programme (2004-06)     Online learning: eLearning Programme (2004-06)     The eLearning programme was aimed at improving the quality and accessibility of European education and training systems through the effective use of information and communication technologies.     ACT     Decision No       2318/2003/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 December 2003 adopting a multiannual programme (2004 to 2006) for the effective integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) in education and training systems in Europe (eLearning Programme).     SUMMARY      Aims      The general objective of the programme was to encourage the efficient use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in European education and training. The aim was to promote quality education and to adapt education and training systems to the needs of a knowledge-based society and the European social cohesion model.     The specific objectives of the programme were to:      explore and promote ways and means of using e-learning to strengthen social cohesion and personal development, foster intercultural dialogue and counteract the digital divide;       promote and develop the use of e-learning in enabling lifelong learning in Europe;       exploit the potential of e-learning for enhancing the European dimension in education;       encourage better-structured cooperation in the field of e-learning between the various Community programmes and instruments and the activities organised by Member States;       provide mechanisms for improving the quality of products and services and for ensuring their effective dissemination and the exchange of good practice.       Actions      Actions taken under the eLearning programme covered:       Promotion of digital literacy        . Actions in this area related to the contribution of ICT to learning, particularly for people who could not benefit from conventional education and training, owing to their geographical location, social situation or special needs. The aim was to identify good examples and build synergies between the many national and European projects for these target groups. A number of studies and a high-level expert group were to produce recommendations in this field.        Creation of European virtual campuses        . Actions in this area aimed to improve integration of the virtual dimension in higher education. The objective was to encourage the development of new organisational models for European virtual universities (virtual campuses) and for exchanging resources and sharing projects (virtual mobility) by building on existing European cooperation arrangements (Erasmus programme, Bologna process) and adding an e-learning dimension to their operational tools (European Credit Transfer System, European Masters, quality assurance, mobility).        Development of e-twinning of primary and secondary schools and promotion of teacher training        . Launched on 14 January 2005, action in this area aimed to strengthen and further develop school networking, more specifically through a European school twinning project designed to allow all schools in Europe to set up pedagogical partnerships with counterparts elsewhere in Europe, thus promoting language learning and intercultural dialogue and enhancing awareness of the model of a multilingual and multicultural model of European society.        Transversal actions and monitoring of e-learning        . Actions in this area were dedicated to the promotion of e-learning in Europe by building on the monitoring of the eLearning action plan. The objectives were to disseminate, promote and adopt good practices and the results of the many projects and programmes financed at European level or by Member States, as well as to reinforce cooperation between the various actors involved, in particular by fostering partnerships between the public and private sectors.      Implementation of the programme also included activities to ensure the dissemination of results (provision of information on the internet, showcasing projects and other events, etc.).      Participating countries      The programme was open to the then 25 Member States of the European Community, the EEA-EFTA countries and the candidate countries for accession to the European Union (EU).      Implementation of the programme      The Commission ensured that the eLearning programme was implemented. It established synergies with other Community programmes and actions and encouraged cooperation with international organisations. The Commission worked together with a committee of representatives of Member States to draw up the annual work plan and budget, as well as all other measures necessary for the implementation of the programme.     The Member States, for their part, had the task of identifying appropriate correspondents to cooperate closely with the Commission as regards relevant information about e-learning use.      Budget      The financial framework for the period from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2006 was EUR 44 million. This budget was allocated as follows:      10 % to e-learning for promoting digital literacy;       30 % to European virtual campuses;       around 45 % to e-twinning of schools in Europe and the promotion of teacher training;       a maximum of 7.5 % to transversal actions and monitoring of the eLearning action plan;       a maximum of 7.5 % to technical and administrative assistance.      Funding was granted following invitations to tender and calls for proposals.      Monitoring and evaluation      The Commission ensured regular monitoring of the programme in cooperation with Member States. In order to assess the general impact of the programme and the relevance and effectiveness of the different actions, the eLearning programme was the subject of an external evaluation.      Background      At the Lisbon European Council of 23 and 24 March 2000, the Heads of State and Government set a new objective for the EU: "to become the world’s most competitive and dynamic knowledge economy by 2010". Since then, Europe has already made substantial progress in introducing ICT, but much remains to be done in order to develop its educational uses. The eLearning programme aimed to plug these gaps by intensifying the efforts already undertaken.

The eLearning programme, together with Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci, was integrated into the new lifelong learning programme 2007-13. Consequently, the final evaluation of the programme for the period 2004-06 was produced jointly with the other two programmes. This report is based on that external evaluation, including an analysis of reports from participating countries.     The positive impact of the eLearning programme was apparent in:      short-term results;       the transnational cooperation between institutions;       the quality of teaching, learning and curricula;       the development of digital literacy.      Overall, the programme provided a significant impact on education and training, contributing to the creation of a European education area. The impact was both quantitative and qualitative, influencing the individual, institutional and policy-making levels. In particular, the eLearning programme provided an added value in tackling socio-economic disparities and in establishing a culture of cooperation among European institutions.     Throughout its duration, the programme funded the following activities:      eTwinning projects involving 7 813 schools (23 812 schools registered for participation);       21 projects on virtual campuses;       25 projects on digital literacy;       16 projects on transversal actions.       Decision No         1720/2006/EC        of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 November 2006 establishing an action programme in the field of lifelong learning [Official Journal L 327 of 24.11.2006].      The eLearning programme has not been renewed as a sectoral programme, but its objectives have been integrated into the       lifelong learning programme (2007-13)      .     The general aim of this programme is to foster interchange, cooperation and mobility between European education and training systems, so that they become a world quality reference. The development of innovative ICT-based content, services, pedagogies and practices is one of the key elements of the programme.

   The Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund     The Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund     A proposal has been made to set up a Global Fund of risk capital with a budget of 100 million to mobilise private investment in projects promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy in developing countries and emerging economies.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 6 October 2006: "Mobilising public and private finance towards global access to climate-friendly, affordable and secure energy services: The Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund" [       COM(2006) 583      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund (GEEREF) proposed by the European Commission will help mobilise private investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy projects.     Boosting such projects will substantially contribute towards sustainable development. It will provide benefits in terms of the environment, climate change and air quality and will also have social and economic benefits in terms of business, job and income creation at local level. It will also help to stabilise energy supply in the poorest regions of the world.      Overcoming investment barriers      Boosting renewable energy and energy efficiency technology calls for investment, in particular in developing countries and emerging economies. Although the prospects are promising, several factors block the participation of private-sector investors and projects and businesses have major difficulties in raising risk capital, which provides vital collateral for lenders.     One of the key reasons causing this block to investments is the significantly higher cost of initial investment in renewable energy generation than for conventional energy. While these costs are compensated by much lower running costs, private-sector investors still regard the longer repayment periods as too risky.     The various risks in developing countries are another hurdle, which means that investors look for additional reassurances.     Moreover, renewable energy technologies are often suited to small and medium sized projects with less than 5-10 million in total capital, whilst international finance institutions and the private sector traditionally do not invest in such small-scale projects.      The GEEREF, a public-private partnership.      The GEEREF will establish a public-private partnership by offering ways of risk sharing and co-financing for projects investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency.     It will mainly target the raising of "patient" risk capital, in other words, capital invested with a long-term prospect of return on the investment. GEEREF participation will range from between 25 and 50 % for medium to high-risk operations to 15 % for low-risk operations. Provision will also be made for dedicated technical assistance funds.     Rather than providing finance directly to projects, GEEREF will help create and fund regional sub-funds or scale up similar existing initiatives. Sub-funds will accommodate the specific conditions and needs of each region.      Beneficiaries      The GEEREF will support projects and businesses engaged in improving energy efficiency and renewable energy. Priority will be given to deploying environmentally sound technologies with a proven technical track record. Special focus will be given to investments of less than 10 million since they are often ignored by commercial investors and international financial institutions.     Regional sub-funds will be set up for the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) region, North Africa, non-EU Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia.      Incentives to support and contribute to the Fund      The minimum funding target for the GEEREF was set at 100 million for it to have a meaningful impact at global level and to be sufficient to establish a public-private partnership that will be self-sustaining over time.     An initial budget of 100 million should be enough to harness additional risk capital, through the sub-fund structure, of 300 million and, in the long term, up to 1 billion.     The European Commission intends to contribute 80 million to the GEEREF for the period 2007-10 with an initial contribution of 15 million proposed for 2007. It hopes that other public and private sources will contribute towards meeting the 100 million target set for the GEEREF.     International financial institutions, such as the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), private-sector investors and other financial intermediaries have already expressed their intention to contribute to this initiative.     Member States, members of the European Economic Area (EEA) and other financial institutions are also invited to participate.      Background      The constant increase in demand for global energy has serious consequences, in particular in terms of air quality, resources and access to energy. The need to ensure sustainable development requires not only combating climate change but also eradicating energy poverty and securing energy supply. It is therefore essential to harness investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy.     The GEEREF initiative is an integral part of the approach put forward in the Green Paper "       A European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy      ".

   Green Paper on agricultural product quality     Green Paper on agricultural product quality     The aim of this consultation is to ensure a strategic and regulatory framework for the protection of agricultural products and to promote their quality. In this respect, the Commission intends to open a wide discussion on the existing instruments, on how they could be improved and on new initiatives which could be considered. Three areas are being reviewed: farming requirements and marketing standards, existing quality schemes and certification schemes.     ACT     Green Paper of 15 October 2008 on agricultural product quality [       COM(2008) 641      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Quality is the European farmers’ most potent weapon in facing competition from emerging countries. In Europe the quality of agricultural products rests on the highest levels of safety guaranteed by Community legislation throughout the whole of the food chain and on other aspects (methods and location of production, etc.).     Quality issues related to food safety which are already covered by other Community actions on nutritional labelling or animal welfare do not form part of this consultation.      Production requirements and marketing standards      Food produced in the European Union (EU) adheres to a range of       farming requirements      . The aim of these requirements is to ensure that all products placed on the market comply with hygiene and safety standards and also respond to a number of environmental, ethical, social, etc. concerns. Many of these farming requirements -those not referring to product hygiene and safety - do not necessarily apply in respect of imported foodstuffs. However, European consumers cannot distinguish between products which adhere to these standards and those which do not. In order to better inform consumers, it is important to ask stakeholders about the possibility of creating a symbol which indicates that a product has been produced in compliance with certain production rules or on the need to indicate the place of production (EU/Non-EU) of primary products.     European       marketing standards      replace the different national standards. Their aim is to help farmers to offer quality products which meet consumer expectations and facilitate price comparison fordifferent qualities of product. For the majority of agricultural products, they will take the form of regulations that lay down definitions of products, minimum product standards, product categories and labelling requirements. As part of the consultation, stakeholders are asked about the need to define and impose compulsory elements (farming requirements, quality classifications, etc.), reserved terms (term ‘farmhouse’, ‘mountain product’) at the European level and on the need to simplify the current marketing standards.      European quality schemes      The system of       geographical indications      ensures the protection of intellectual property. This system includes Protected Designations of Origin (PDO) and Protected Geographical Indications (PGI) which describe the characteristics (PDO) or the reputation (PGI) of a product which are connected to their geographical area of origin. For consumers,       geographical indications      guarantee authentic, quality products which meet their expectations. To benefit from a PDO, all stages of production should, in principle, have taken place in the geographical area of origin. In the case of a PGI only one stage of production will suffice (this is the case with spirits in particular). The Green Paper aims to identify the necessary means to improve and develop the system of geographical indications as well as to protect this system in third countries.     The system of       Traditional Specialities Guaranteed      (TSG) was created in 1992. The TSGs are agricultural products or foodstuffs that have traditional composition or that are produced using traditional raw materials or traditional methods of production. Since its creation, only 20 TSGs have been registered under this system. This relatively low number raises the question whether a better means of identifying and promoting traditional specialities exists.     Since the adoption of Regulation (EC) No       834/2007      on the production and labelling of       organic products      , the main challenge has been to create an internal market for organic food. At present the market for organic food functions essentially along national lines. It is important, therefore, to consider possibilities which would enable the creation of a genuine single market for organic food at the EU level.     The system aimed at promoting       quality products originating from the outermost regions      rests on the introduction of a logo. To obtain this logo, producers must adhere to a number of requirements defined in compliance with       Community regulations      or in their absence, international regulations. To what extent could trade organisations, following the example of Spain and France, adopt additional specific requirements aimed at improving the quality of regional products and increasing the volume of quality agricultural products originating from the outermost regions of the EU?     Should other systems emerge, for example to identify products of ‘high-nature value’ or ‘mountain’ products?      Quality certification schemes      For consumers, food quality certification schemes offer additional guarantees that the       label claim can be relied on      . These schemes concern not only compliance with compulsory production standards, but also requirements such as environmental protection, animal welfare, fair trade, religious or cultural considerations, farming methods, product origin, etc. These requirements have led to a multitude of certification schemes and quality labels which sometimes give rise to concerns about the transparency of the requirements of the systems in question, the reliability of the claims and the fairness of commercial relations. The Green Paper opens the debate on how to protect the consumer and avoid additional constraints and costs for producers.      Context      The Commission invites all organisations and citizens who have an interest in the quality of agricultural products to submit their contributions before 31 December 2008. These contributions will form a basis for developing a Communication (Commission document establishing strategic guidelines) which should be published in May 2009.     Last updated: 20.03.2009  
summary of   Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 — materials and articles intended to come into contact with food   summary    what does this regulation do   It lays down common rules for packaging materials and articles such as bottles and containers, which come, or may come, into contact with food, either directly or indirectly.   It seeks to protect human health and consumers’ interests as well as ensure that the products used may be sold anywhere in the European Economic Area – an area comprising the 28 EU countries (   1   ), Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway in which there is free movement of persons, goods, services and capital.   key points    The legislation identifies 17 groups of materials and articles, ranging from cork and glass to plastic and textiles, where specific measures may be adopted.   These may include measures such as purity standards and a list of the substances used.   An application for the use of a new substance must be submitted to the relevant national authority which then forwards it to the  European Food Safety Authority  for its opinion.   Materials used for packaging must be identified as ‘for food contact’ and accompanied by a suitable logo such as a coffee machine, wine bottle or soup spoon.   Traceability measures must be in place to make it possible to recall any defective products or provide the public with specific information.   National authorities may suspend the use of a particular material if detailed grounds emerge that it might endanger human health. They immediately inform the  European Commission  and their counterparts in all European Economic Area countries of their decision.   The rules authorise the use of ‘active’ and ‘intelligent’ packaging, which can extend the shelf-life of food and give information on its freshness, provided it does not adversely affect its composition.   The rules do not apply to antique materials (e.g. antique ceramic pots) and articles or coatings, such as cheese rind, prepared meat products or fruit, which form part of the food or may be eaten with it.   from when does the regulation apply  It entered into force on 3 December 2004.   background   See  chemical safety of food  on the European Commission's website.   act   Regulation (EC) No  1935/2004  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 2004 on materials and articles intended to come into contact with food and repealing Directives 80/590/EEC and 89/109/EEC (OJ L 338, 13.11.2004, pp. 4-17)  Successive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 have been incorporated in the basic text.

   EU-wide rail safety     EU-wide rail safety     SUMMARY OF:      Directive (EU) 2016/798 on railway safety      WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?      It aims to enhance railway safety across the EU by revising the role of national safety authorities (NSAs) and reallocating responsibilities between them and the         European Union Agency for Railways        (the Agency).       The directive is one of 3 legislative acts covering the technical aspects of the         fourth railway package        which aims to revitalise the rail sector and deliver a better quality of service and more choice to passengers. It works alongside Regulation (EU)         2016/796        on the         European Union Agency for Railways        and Directive (EU)         2016/797        on the         interoperability of the EU rail system        .       Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the directive was amended by Regulation (EU)         2020/698        and Directive (EU)         2020/700        to extend the deadline for incorporating the directive into EU countries’ national law.      KEY POINTS     The directive sets out a number of measures to develop and improve safety and to improve access to the market for rail transport services, including:      establishing the Agency as a body issuing safety certificates to railway undertakings which operate in more than one EU country;       defining the responsibilities between the different bodies involved in the EU rail system;       developing         common safety targets        and         common safety methods        with the aim of removing national rules and therefore barriers to the development of a single European railway area;       setting out the principles for issuing, renewing, amending and restricting or revoking safety certificates and authorisations;       requiring each EU country to establish a national safety authority and an investigation body for railway accidents and incidents;       defining common principles for the management and supervision of railway safety.       Scope      The directive applies to the rail system in EU countries, it does not apply to:      metros;       trams and light rail vehicles and infrastructure used exclusively by those vehicles;       networks that are not part of the EU rail system and that are intended to operate only local, urban or suburban passenger services, along with companies that operate solely on these networks.       Development and management of safety       Within their respective competences under EU law, the         Agency and the EU countries        are responsible for ensuring that railway safety is maintained and generally improved with a priority placed on preventing accidents.        EU countries        are also responsible for ensuring that:          measures to develop and improve safety follow a system-based approach;           infrastructure managers and railway companies are responsible for the safe operation of the EU rail system and the control of any associated risks.         Common safety methods and targets       The assessment of safety levels, the achievement of safety targets and compliance with other safety requirements are established using         common safety methods (CSMs)        . In particular, common methods for:          risk and evaluation assessment;           assessing conformity for issuing safety certificates and safety authorisations;           supervision by national safety authorities and for monitoring by railway companies, infrastructure managers and railway maintenance bodies;           assessing the achievement of safety targets at EU and national level.         Minimum safety targets to be achieved by the EU rail system as a whole are set out in         common safety targets (CSTs)        . CSTs may take the form of risk acceptance criteria or target safety levels.       Single safety certificate       Access to the EU railway infrastructure will only be granted to companies holding a         single safety certificate        issued either by the Agency or by the relevant national safety authorities.       The purpose of the certificate is to provide evidence that the company concerned has established its safety management system and that it is able to operate safely in its intended area of operation.       Amendments following the COVID-19 outbreak       Directive (EU) 2016/798 was due to have taken effect from 16 June 2020. However, to provide the railway sector with greater legal certainty and flexibility to deal with the exceptional circumstances arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, amending Directive (EU) 2020/700 was adopted to extend transposition and repeal periods of Directive (EU) 2016/798 (originally set at 16 June 2020 to 31 October 2020). It also aligns the application dates for the CSMs with the revised deadlines.       Regulation (EU) 2020/698 lays down specific and temporary measures in view of the COVID‐19 outbreak concerning renewing or extending certain certificates, licences and authorisations and the postponing certain periodic checks and periodic training in certain areas of transport legislation. The regulation         extends the time limits        laid down in Directive (EU) 2016/798 with regard to the renewal of single safety certificates that expire between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 and the validity of safety authorisations that expire between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 by         6 months        .       Amendment as regards the application of railway safety and interoperability rules within the Channel Fixed Link      Regulation (EU)       2020/1530      extends the definition of the national safety authority with regards to any body entrusted by an EU country and a non-EU country and sets out arrangements therewith.     FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?     The directive has applied since 15 June 2016 and had to become law in the EU countries by 16 June 2020. This date has been further extended by amending Directive (EU) 2020/700 until 31 October 2020.

   Kyoto Protocol on climate change     Kyoto Protocol on climate change     The Kyoto Protocol, which follows the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, is one of the chief instruments for tackling climate change. It contains the undertakings entered into by the industrialised countries to reduce their emissions of certain greenhouse gases which are responsible for global warming. The total emissions of the developed countries are to be reduced by at least 5 % over the period 2008-2012 compared with 1990 levels.     ACT     Council Decision       2002/358/EC      of 25 April 2002 concerning the approval, on behalf of the European Community, of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the joint fulfilment of commitments thereunder.     SUMMARY     On 4 February 1991 the Council authorised the Commission to participate on behalf of the European Community in the negotiation of a       United Nations framework convention on climate change      , which was adopted in New York on 9 May 1992. The European Community ratified the Framework Convention by Decision       94/69/EC      of 15 December 1993. The Framework Convention entered into force on 21 March 1994.     The Framework Convention made a large contribution towards the establishment of key principles of the international fight against climate change. In particular, it defines the principle of "common but differentiated responsibility". It also helped to make people the world over more aware of the problems linked to climate change. However, the Convention does not contain commitments in figures, detailed on a country by country basis, in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.     At the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties in Berlin in March 1995, the Parties to the Convention decided to negotiate a Protocol containing measures to reduce emissions for the period beyond 2000 in the industrialised countries. After much work, the       Kyoto Protocol      was adopted on 11 December 1997 in Kyoto.     The European Community signed the Protocol on 29 April 1998. In December 2001 the Laeken European Council confirmed that the Union wanted to see the Kyoto Protocol enter into force ahead of the Johannesburg world summit on sustainable development (26 August – 4 September 2002). To that end,       this Decision approved the Protocol on behalf of the Community      . The Member States were to coordinate their action to deposit their instruments of ratification at the same time as the Community, and as far as possible by 1 June 2002.     Annex II to the Decision sets out the       commitments to limit and reduce emissions      agreed by the Community and its Member States for the initial commitment period (2008 to 2012).      The contents of the Protocol      The Kyoto Protocol tackles emissions of       six greenhouse gases      :      carbon dioxide (CO2);       methane (CH4);       nitrous oxide (N2O);       hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs);       perfluorocarbons (PFCs);       sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).      It represents an important step forward in the effort to tackle global warming as it includes       binding, quantified objectives      for limiting and reducing greenhouse gases.     Overall, the Parties to Annex I to the Framework Convention (i.e. the industrialised countries) undertake collectively to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, to       reduce the total emissions of the developed      countries by at least 5 % below 1990 levels, during the period 2008 to 2012. Annex B to the Protocol contains the quantified commitments given by the Parties.     The       States which were members of the EU before 2004 must collectively reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 8 %      between 2008 and 2012. Member States which joined the EU after that date undertake to reduce their emissions by 8 %, with the exception of Poland and Hungary (6 %), and Malta and Cyprus, which are not listed in Annex I to the Framework Convention.     For the period up to 2008, the Parties undertake to make demonstrable progress in achieving their commitments by no later than 2005.     Parties who so wish, may make 1995 a reference year for emissions of HFCs, PFCs and SF6.     The Protocol suggests       various means      of attaining these objectives:      stepping up or introducing national policies to reduce emissions (greater energy efficiency, promotion of sustainable forms of agriculture, development of renewable energy sources, etc.);       cooperation with the other Contracting Parties (exchanges of experience or information, coordination of national policies through emission permits, joint implementation and a clean development mechanism).      No later than one year prior to the start of the first commitment period, each Party must have set up a       national system of the estimation of emissions of human origin      and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases (not controlled by the Montreal Protocol).     Commitments will be reviewed by 2005 at the latest, for the second commitment period.     On 31 May 2002, the European Union ratified the Kyoto Protocol. Following its ratification by Russia, the Protocol entered into force on 16 February 2005. Several industrialised countries have refused to ratify the Protocol, including the United States and Australia.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 — food additives   what is the aim of the regulation   It replaces previous European Union (EU) legislation by bringing all types of food additives  *  under one legal act.   It provides lists of:    approved additives  ;   conditions on their  use  and  labelling  .     It also simplifies the authorisation procedure.   key points    Only  EU-approved  additives may be sold and used in food.   To be approved, a food additive must not pose any  health risks  or  mislead consumers  . It must meet a  reasonable need  that cannot be achieved in any other way.   An additive must provide  benefits for consumers  . These include:   preserving food’s nutritional quality;   helping in its manufacture, processing, preparation, treatment, packing, transport or storage;   meeting special dietary needs.     Specific conditions apply to  sweeteners  and  colourings  .   Additives should be used at the lowest level needed to achieve the desired effect. This level must take account of an  acceptable daily intake  and the needs of  special groups  of consumers (e.g. people with allergies).   Additives should not, as a rule, be used in:    unprocessed foods  ;   foods for  infants  and  young children  .     Additives, whether for sale to the final consumer or not, must meet  clear labelling requirements  , such as providing the name and/or E-number (for instance, sunset yellow colouring is E 110).   The legislation does not apply to the following substances, unless they are used as food additives:    processing aids  , i.e. a substance used to process raw materials;   substances used to  protect plants  and  plant products  ;    nutrients  and added to food;    water treatment  substances.     from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 20 January 2010.   background   Most evaluations of additives date back to the 1980s and 1990s. They are now being re-evaluated. This process should be completed by 2020.  After that, the  European Commission  may propose changes to the current usage conditions, or remove some additives from the approved list.  For more information, see:    Food additives  on the European Commission website;    Food additives  on the European Food Safety Authority website.   * key terms     Food additives:  substances used in foods for different reasons, e.g. to sweeten them, provide colour or prolong shelf life.
   Convention on the use of information technology for customs purposes (CIS)     Convention on the use of information technology for customs purposes (CIS)     The purpose of this act is to assist in preventing, investigating and prosecuting serious breaches of national laws by increasing, through the rapid dissemination of information, the effectiveness of cooperation and control procedures of the customs administrations of the Member States.     ACT     Council Act       95/C 316/02      of 26 July 1995 drawing up the Convention on the use of information technology for customs purposes.     SUMMARY     The Member State's customs authorities will set up and maintain a joint automated information system for customs purposes, hereinafter referred to as the "Customs Information System" (CIS).     The Customs Information System will consist of a central database facility accessible via terminals in each Member State. It will contain only the data, including personal data, necessary to achieve its aim, in the following categories:      commodities;       means of transport;       businesses;       persons;       fraud trends;       availability of expertise.      The Member States will determine the items to be included in the Customs Information System relating to each of the three last categories to the extent that this is necessary to achieve the aim of the system. No items of personal data will be included in the last two categories.     Personal data will be confined to:      name, maiden name, forenames and alias;       date and place of birth;       nationality;       sex;       any particular objective and permanent physical characteristics;       reason for inclusion of data;       suggested action;       warning code indicating any history of being armed, violent or escaping.      Under no circumstances may personal data listed in Article 6, first sentence, of the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with Regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data signed at Strasbourg on 28 January 1981 (the Strasbourg Convention) be included.     Direct access to data included in the Customs Information System is reserved exclusively for the national authorities designated by each Member State. These national authorities will be customs administrations, but may also include other authorities competent under the laws, regulations and procedures of the Member State in question to act in order to achieve the aim of the Convention.     Member States may only use data from the Customs Information System to achieve the Convention's aim; however, they may use it for administrative or other purposes with the prior authorisation of and subject to any conditions imposed by the Member State which entered it in the system. Such use must be in accordance with the laws, regulations and procedures of the Member State which seeks to use it and must take into account Principle 5.5 of Recommendation R (87) 15 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe dated 17 September 1987.     Inclusion of data in the Customs Information System will be governed by the laws, regulations and procedures of the supplying Member State except where the Convention lays down more stringent provisions.     Each Member State will designate a competent customs administration to have national responsibility for the Customs Information System.     That administration will be responsible for the correct operation of the System within the Member State and will take the measures necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Convention.     Only the supplying Member State will have the right to amend, supplement, correct or delete data which it has included in the Customs Information System.     Data entered in the Customs Information System will be kept only for the time necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was entered. The need for its retention will be reviewed at least once a year by the supplying Member State.     Each Member State intending to receive personal data from the Customs Information System or include it in the system must adopt national legislation sufficient to achieve a level of protection of personal data at least equivalent to that resulting from the principles of the 1981 Strasbourg Convention by the time the CIS Convention enters into force.     The rights of persons with regard to personal data in the Customs Information System, in particular their right of access, will be exercised in accordance with the laws, regulations and procedures of the Member States in which such rights are invoked.     A committee consisting of representatives from the Member State's customs administrations will be set up. It will adopt its rules of procedure unanimously.     Each Member State will designate a national supervisory authority or authorities responsible for personal data protection to carry out independent supervision of such data entered in the Customs Information System.     A Joint Supervisory Authority will be set up. It will comprise two representatives from each Member State drawn from the respective independent national supervisory authority or authorities.     All administrative measures necessary to maintain security will be taken either by the Member States' authorities or by the committee referred to in point 12, respectively for the terminals installed in the Member States and for the Customs Information System and the terminals located on the same premises as the System.     Each Member State will be responsible for the accuracy, currency and lawfulness of data it has entered in the Customs Information System. It will also be responsible for complying with Article 5 of the 1981 Strasbourg Convention.     The CIS convention will be adopted by Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.     Member States will notify the Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union (EU) of the completion of their constitutional requirements for adopting the Convention.     The Secretary-General of the Council of the EU will act as depository for the convention.

   Agreements with the countries of the Western Balkans on the facilitation of the issuance of visas     Agreements with the countries of the Western Balkans on the facilitation of the issuance of visas     The agreements concluded between the European Union (EU) and the countries of the Western Balkans on facilitating the issuance of visas are intended to simplify and speed up the procedures for issuing visas to nationals of these Western Balkan countries. These agreements are, in principle, coupled with readmission agreements.     ACT      Council Decision         2007/821/EC        of 8 November 2007 on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Albania on the facilitation of the issuance of visas.       Council Decision         2007/822/EC        of 8 November 2007 on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and Bosnia and Herzegovina on the facilitation of the issuance of visas.

Council Decision         2007/824/EC        of 8 November 2007 on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on the facilitation of the issuance of visas.       Council Decision         2007/825/EC        of 8 November 2007 on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Serbia on the facilitation of the issuance of visas.      SUMMARY     The agreements concluded with Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ("partner countries") are intended to facilitate the issuance of short-stay visas to citizens of these countries for stays of       up to 90 days      per period of 180 days.     When applying for such short-stay visas, citizens of these partner countries benefit from       simplified document requirements      for justifying the purpose of their journey to the European Union (EU). The documentary evidence to be presented consists of formal documents, such as a written request from the host organisation or other certificate, depending on the category of the applicant (business people, drivers for international transportation services, journalists, students, persons travelling for tourism or for medical reasons, representatives of civil society organisations, etc.).     EU countries’ diplomatic missions and consular posts may issue       multiple-entry visas      that are valid for up to five years to: members of the governments, parliaments, constitutional courts and supreme courts of partner countries; permanent members of official delegations; spouses and children under the age of 21 visiting citizens of partner countries legally residing in the territory of an EU country. The categories of persons who benefit from simplified document requirements may also be granted multiple-entry visas with a maximum validity period of one year. However, the person concerned must have obtained and used at least one visa during the previous year and have valid reasons for requesting a multiple-entry visa. If such a person has made use of the one-year multiple-entry visa during the previous two years, s/he may be granted a multiple-entry visa that is valid a minimum of two and a maximum of five years.     The       standard fee      for processing visa applications of partner countries’ citizens is 35 euros. This is waived for certain categories of persons, including close relatives, members of official delegations, students, disabled persons, children under the age of six, journalists, pensioners and drivers for international transportation services.     Visas are issued within       10 days      of the receipt of the application. This may be extended to up to 30 days when further scrutiny of the application is needed or may be reduced to 3 days or even less in emergencies.      Background      The participants at the EU-Western Balkans Summit held in Thessaloniki on 21 June 2003 ("Thessaloniki Agenda") agreed on the principle of liberalisation of the visa regime and began negotiations with a view to concluding the necessary agreements. This process, coupled with discussions on the conclusion of       readmission agreements      , resulted on 8 November 2007 in the adoption of a series of Council decisions, one for each of the partner countries, establishing the conclusion of agreements based on Article 62, taken in conjunction with Article 300, of the Treaty establishing the European Community (now Articles 77 and 218 respectively of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union).

summary of   Directive 2010/75/EU — on industrial emissions   what is the aim of the directive  It lays down rules to prevent or, where that is not practicable, to reduce industrial emissions into air, water and land and to prevent the generation of waste, in order to achieve a high level of environmental protection.   key points    Scope    The legislation covers industrial activities in the following sectors:    energy  ;    metal production and processing  ;    minerals  ;    chemicals  ;    waste management  ;   and other sectors such as  pulp and paper production  ,  slaughterhouses  and the  intensive rearing of poultry and pigs  .     All installations covered by the directive must prevent and reduce pollution by applying the  best available techniques (BATs)   *  and address efficient energy use, waste prevention and management and measures to prevent accidents and limit their consequences.    Permits    The installations can only operate if in possession of a permit and have to comply with the conditions set therein.   Permit conditions are based on the  BAT conclusions  adopted by the  European Commission  .   Emission limit values must be set at a level that ensures pollutant emissions do not exceed the levels associated with the use of BATs, unless it is proven that this would lead to  disproportionate costs  compared to environmental benefits.     National authorities are required to conduct regular inspections of the installations.    Specific rules   The directive sets down minimum requirements for specific sectors in separate chapters. It includes specific rules relating to:    combustion plants  — operating aspects, emission limits, monitoring and compliance rules;    waste incineration plants and waste co-incineration plants  — operating requirements, emissions limits, monitoring and compliance rules;   installations and activities using  organic solvents  — includes emission limits, reduction schemes and requirements to substitute hazardous substances;   installations producing  titanium dioxide  — sets emission limits, monitoring rules, and bans the disposal of certain forms of waste into any body of water.    Repeal   The directive repeals and replaces 7 previously existing directives: the Integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC) Directive (Directive  2008/1/EC  ), the Large Combustion Plants Directive (Directive  2001/80/EC  ), the Waste Incineration Directive (Directive  2000/76/EC  ), the Solvents Emissions Directive (Directive  1999/13/EC  ) and 3 directives on Titanium Dioxide (  78/176/EEC  ,  82/883/EEC  ,  92/112/EEC  ).   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 6 January 2011 and had to become law in the EU countries by 7 January 2013.   background    Directive  2011/92/EU  sets out the rules for  environmental impact assessments  of a wide range of public and private projects — see  summary  .   For further information, see:    Industrial emissions  (  European Commission  ).     key terms    Best available techniques (BATs):  the most effective techniques for preventing or reducing emissions that are technically feasible and economically viable within the sector.
summary of   Directive (EU) 2019/1024 on open data and the reuse of public-sector information   what is the aim of the directive   It lays down the legal framework for the reuse  *  of public-sector information such as geographical, land registry, statistical or legal information held by public-sector bodies  *  or public undertakings  *  , and of publicly funded research data.   It aims to boost the socioeconomic potential of public-sector information, e.g. by making it more easily available for start-ups and  small and medium-sized enterprises  , by increasing the supply of dynamic data  *  and of datasets with a particularly high economic impact, and by promoting competition and transparency in the information market.   It is part of a package of measures designed to reinforce the EU’s data economy, including the development of artificial intelligence.   Also referred to as the ‘open data directive’, it  recasts  Directive  2003/98/EC  by repealing it by 17 July 2021.   key points   The recasted directive is based on the general principle that public and publicly funded data should be reusable for commercial or non-commercial purposes.   Open data   The directive promotes the use of open data (data presented in open formats  *  that one can use freely and share for any purpose). Public-sector bodies and public undertakings must make their documents available in any pre-existing format or language and, where appropriate, by electronic means in formats that are open, machine readable, accessible, findable and reusable, complete with their metadata.   Practical arrangements for reuse    Public-sector bodies must, through electronic means where appropriate, process requests for document reuse, making them available within a reasonable time.   At the same time, they should make necessary arrangements to facilitate the online search and discovery of the documents they keep.   EU countries must also facilitate effective reuse of documents, in particular by supplying information on the rights outlined in the directive and by offering assistance and guidance.    Dynamic and real-time data   Dynamic data must be made available for reuse immediately on collection via an application programming interface (API) and, where relevant, as a bulk download.   Research data    EU countries must adopt policies and take action to make publicly funded research data openly available, following the principle of ‘open by default’ and support the dissemination of research data that are findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (the ‘FAIR’ principle).   Concerns relating to intellectual property rights, personal data protection and confidentiality, security and legitimate commercial interests must be taken into account in accordance with the principle of ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’.   Publicly funded research data can be reused for commercial or non-commercial purposes in cases where they are already made publicly available via institutional or subject-based repository.    Fair trading and non-discrimination    The reuse of documents is open to everyone in the market and any applicable reuse conditions should be non-discriminatory.   As a general rule, arrangements between public-sector bodies or public undertakings holding the documents and third parties cannot grant exclusive rights.   In narrowly defined cases where the directive allows for the conclusion of such arrangements, their validity is subject to regular review and special transparency requirements apply.    High value datasets   The  European Commission  is given the possibility to adopt a list of high-value datasets which should be made available in machine-readable formats and free of charge through APIs. The datasets will be selected from within 6 thematic categories set out in Annex I:   geospatial;   earth observation and environment;   meteorological;   statistics;   companies and company ownership; and   mobility.   New thematic categories may be added by the Commission, by way of a  delegated act  .   Charges    The reuse of documents should be free of charge. However, marginal costs incurred to reproduce and disseminate documents, anonymise personal data and protect commercially confidential information may be recovered.   By way of exception, cultural institutions, public undertakings and some public-sector bodies that fulfil the requirements set out in Article 6(2) may charge beyond the default principle in order to recover the eligible costs.    Exceptions   The directive does not apply to:   documents for which third parties hold intellectual property rights;   documents whose access is excluded or restricted on the virtue of a national access regime or on the grounds of sensitive critical infrastructure protection;   documents whose supply falls outside the scope of the public task of a public-sector body or outside the scope of provision of services in the general interest of a public undertaking;   documents related to the activities of a public undertaking directly exposed to competition and therefore not subject to procurement rules under Article 34 of Directive  2014/25/EU  ;   other documents referred to in Article 1(2) of the directive.   from when does the directive apply  It has been in force since 16 July 2019. Directive (EU) 2019/1024  recasts  and replaces Directive  2003/98/EC  (and its subsequent amendments) as of 17 July 2021. It has to become national law in the EU countries by the same date.   background   For more information, see:    Digital single market  (  European Commission  )    Open access  (  European Commission  )    Open data  (  European Commission  )    Non-legislative measures to facilitate reuse  (  European Commission  )    EU Open Data Portal  .   key terms    Reuse:  the use by persons or legal entities of documents held by public-sector bodies or public undertakings.   Public-sector body:  means the state, regional or local authorities, bodies governed by public law or associations formed by such authorities or bodies governed by public law.   Public undertaking:  means any undertaking over which public-sector bodies have a dominant influence through ownership, financial participation therein, or the rules which govern it; these include those acting as  public passenger road or rail transport operators  ,  air carriers  and  EU shipowners fulfilling public-service obligations  .   Dynamic data:  means documents in a digital form, subject to frequent or real-time updates due to their volatility or rapid obsolescence; typically data generated by sensors.   Open format:  a file format that is platform-independent and made available to the public without any restriction that impedes the re-use of documents.
   Strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste     Strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste     This strategy sets out guidelines and describes measures aimed at reducing the pressure on the environment caused by waste production and management. The main thrust of the strategy is on amending the legislation to improve implementation, and on preventing waste and promoting effective recycling.     ACT     Commission Communication of 21 December 2005 "Taking sustainable use of resources forward: A Thematic Strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste" [       COM(2005) 666      - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This strategy sets out guidelines for European Union (EU) action and describes the ways in which waste management can be improved.     The aim of the strategy is to reduce the negative impact on the environment that is caused by waste throughout its life-span, from production to disposal, via recycling. This approach means that every item of waste is seen not only as a source of pollution to be reduced, but also as a potential resource to be exploited.     The objectives of the Community legislation preceding the adoption of this strategy still apply, namely limiting waste, and promoting the re-use, recycling and recovery of waste. These objectives are integrated into the approach based on environmental impact and on the life-cycle of resources.      Improving the general legal framework      The strategy provides for existing legislation to be simplified. This will mainly be done by merging the       framework Directive on waste      with the Hazardous Waste Directive and the Waste Oil Directive by removing any overlap between the framework Directive on waste and the       IPPC Directive      (for example regarding the award of permits) as well as by consolidating the three Directives on waste from the titanium dioxide industry.     Some concepts will be clarified:      the proposal for a framework Directive which accompanies the strategy (see Related Acts below) provides for environmental criteria to be drawn up to determine when waste ceases to be considered waste. These criteria will be fixed for certain types of waste where the current definition creates legal uncertainty and administrative costs;       a new definition of recovery and disposal activities is proposed in order to promote best environmental practice. To this end, efficiency levels will be introduced to distinguish recovery operations from disposal activities;       a definition of recycling is inserted into the proposal for a Framework Directive on waste.       Preventing the negative impact of waste      The strategy aims to limit waste production, but it does not include an overall waste-prevention target because these do not necessarily lead to improvements in the environment. Certain techniques used to reduce the volume of waste are actually more polluting than others, even if using them means greater reductions in volume.     The main focus of the strategy for preventing waste production is on reducing the environmental impact of waste and products that will become waste. In order to be effective, this impact must be reduced at every stage of a resource's life-span. Applying the instruments set up under existing Community legislation, such as disseminating best available techniques or       eco-design of products      , is therefore an important factor in achieving this.     The strategy also offers a coordinated framework for specific national actions. Under the new proposal for a framework Directive on waste, the Member States are therefore required to develop programmes to prevent waste production. These programmes include specific prevention targets to be implemented at the most appropriate level and which must be made public.     Life-cycle thinking requires an improving knowledge of the impact of resource use on waste generation and management, as well as more systematic forecasting and modelling.     This approach complements that in the IPPC Directive, the Directive on       integrated product policy      and the       Strategy on the use of natural resources      . It will help reduce pressure on the environment (depletion and pollution) at every stage of the resource life-cycle, covering the production, collection, use and final disposal of resources.      Promoting the recycling of waste      The strategy aims to promote the recycling sector in order to reintroduce waste into the economic cycle in the form of quality products, while at the same time minimising the negative environmental impact of doing so.     Recycling targets could in the long run be set at appropriate levels, taking account of the characteristics of each material and the range of options for recycling it.     Recycling could be encouraged by amending the regulatory framework, in particular to include the option of introducing efficiency criteria for recovery operations as well as criteria for distinguishing waste and products, criteria which would lead to minimum quality standards and which would facilitate the dissemination of best practice in Europe.     The strategy provides for other measures, such as the exchange of information on national disposal taxes as well as, eventually, measures which would supplement the market mechanisms should these prove inadequate in increasing recycling levels.     The strategy places particular emphasis on biodegradable waste, two-thirds of which must be redirected to be disposed of using methods other than landfill as is required under       Directive 1999/31/EC      . The strategy provides, in particular, for the Commission to adopt guidelines, for Member States to adopt management strategies, and for this matter to be included in revision of the IPPC Directive and the       Directive on the use of sewage sludge      in agriculture.      Background      All material placed on the market is destined to become waste at one time or another, and every production process generates some form of waste. At present, 49% of EU municipal waste is disposed of through landfill, 18% is incinerated and 33% is recycled or composted.     Despite progress made in recycling and incineration, the amount of landfilled waste has not decreased because waste production continues to increase. What is more, some substances are particularly dangerous and polluting and pose serious risks to the environment and health when removed from the economic circuit.     This strategy will open up new waste management possibilities in order to reduce the amount of landfilled waste, recover more compost and energy from waste, and improve the quantity and quality of recycling. The main benefits expected are increased efficiency and better cost-effectiveness due to the emphasis placed on environmental impact, a reduction in costs and obstacles to recycling, and a reduction in pollution caused by waste, in particular greenhouse gas emissions.     The strategy on waste prevention and recycling is one of the seven thematic strategies set out in the       Sixth Action Programme for the Environment      adopted in 2002.     RELATED ACTS      Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 December 2005 on waste [         COM(2005) 677        - Not published in the Official Journal].      The aim of this proposal is to revise the framework Directive on waste. The proposal integrates the contents of the Hazardous Waste Directive and the Waste Oil Directive into the new Directive. It also introduces an environmental objective and clarifies certain concepts (recovery, end of waste). It introduces procedures that will facilitate the development of minimum quality standards. It also obliges the Member States to draw up national waste-prevention programmes.

summary of   Decision 2001/470/EC establishing a European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters  (EJN-civil)   what is the aim of this decision  It establishes the European Judicial Network to improve legal cooperation in civil and commercial matters  *  between EU countries.   key points   The EJN-civil is an informal, flexible structure, whose aim is to simplify and strengthen judicial cooperation between EU countries. It facilitates contacts between different national courts via a network of national contact points.  The main  tasks  of the EJN-civil are to:   facilitate judicial cooperation in cross-border cases e.g. providing assistance with the serving of documents or taking of evidence;   inform EU citizens on cross-border access to justice, mainly through factsheets and citizens’ guides on specific EU laws, published on the  EU e-Justice portal  ;   assess and share experience on the application of EU law in order to identify weaknesses and explore ways of strengthening EU law.   The EJN-civil is composed of  contact points  and  relevant bodies  specialised in EU civil and commercial law from the EU countries, e.g.:   judicial or administrative bodies in EU countries responsible for judicial cooperation;   professional associations of lawyers directly involved in the application of EU civil and commercial law.   Denmark does not participate in the EJN-civil.  Regarding  organisation  , the EJN-civil carries out its activities through regular meetings of the contact points, mainly in Brussels. The secretariat of the EJN-civil is managed by the  European Commission  which liaises with the contact points on the work and priorities of the network.   from when does the decision apply  It has applied since 1 December 2002.   background     EJN in civil and commercial matters    * key terms     Civil and commercial law:  laws affecting citizens and business, excluding criminal law, family law, bankruptcy and inheritance law.

Through its accession to the Agreement, the Community subscribed to a defined list of Regulations, including Regulation No 93 concerning front underrun protective devices for commercial vehicles having a mass exceeding 3.5 tonnes.       In order to reduce the number of European road accident casualties, the Commission proposes the introduction of the measures established by that Regulation into the EC type-approval procedure set up by Council Directive         70/156/EEC        .       A front underrun protective device is defined as "a front underrun protective device which is intended to be part of a vehicle and which can be approved as a separate technical unit in accordance with Directive         70/156/EEC"        .       Member States may not refuse to grant type-approval (EC or national), or prohibit the registration, sale or entry into service of vehicles on grounds relating to their front underrun protection if it complies with the technical requirements of the Directive.       Member States may no longer grant type-approval (EC or national) and must prohibit the registration, sale or entry into service of vehicles on grounds relating to their front underrun protection if it does not comply with the technical requirements of the Directive.       Applications for EC type-approval must be submitted by the manufacturer of the front underrun protective device, using the model information document in the Annex to the Directive as a basis. A representative sample of the type of device to be approved must be submitted to the technical service responsible for conducting the type-approval tests.       The technical requirements which have to be complied with in order to obtain a type-approval in accordance with the Directive are those set out in United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Regulation 93.

   Towards a Strategy on the Rights of the Child     Towards a Strategy on the Rights of the Child     The European Commission proposes a strategy to effectively promote and safeguard the rights of the child in the European Union's internal and external policies and to support Member States' efforts in this field.     ACT     Commission communication of 4 July 2006 - Towards an EU strategy on the rights of the child [       COM(2006) 367      - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Children's       *      rights form an integral part of the human rights that the EU is bound to respect under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Optional Protocols, the Millennium Development Goals and the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR). In addition, the EU explicitly recognised children's rights in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.     Children's rights are still far from being generally respected, and there are still cases of basic childhood needs not being met, such as the right to an adequate diet, basic medical care and education. Moreover, many children are put to forced labour, are victims of human trafficking, or are involved in armed conflicts as child soldiers.     The specific problems found in the EU include social exclusion of Roma children, child trafficking, child pornography on the Internet, and the administering to children of drugs not previously subjected to specific tests.     Building on its long-standing tradition and commitment with regard to human rights in general and children's rights in particular, the EU has the necessary weight to push children's rights to the forefront of the international agenda and to encourage specific attention to children's needs, drawing on Europe's values of social protection and on the other programmes it is implementing.     In this document, the European Commission proposes a strategy for protecting the rights of the child within the framework of the EU's internal and external policies. This strategy is based on the following specific objectives:      taking advantage of existing policies and instruments;       establishing the priorities of future EU action;       systematically taking the rights of the child into account in all EU external and internal policies ("mainstreaming");       ensuring efficient coordination and consultation mechanisms;       reinforcing competence and expertise on the rights of the child;       communicating more effectively on the rights of the child;       promoting the rights of the child in the field of external relations.      In order to attain these objectives, this strategy envisages a number of measures, namely:      setting up one single six-digit telephone number (beginning with 116) within the EU for child helplines, as well as a number for a hotline dedicated to missing and sexually exploited children;       support for the banking sector and credit card companies in combating the use of credit cards when purchasing sexual images of children on the Internet;       launching an Action Plan on Children in Development Cooperation;       publication of a consultation document with a view to identifying actions to be implemented in the future;       setting up a European Forum for the Rights of the Child and an online discussion platform;       involving children in the decision-making process;       development of a communication strategy on the rights of the child, helping both children and their parents to improve their knowledge of these rights.      The Commission is committed to allocating the resources needed for the measures proposed in this Communication and for future strategy. A progress report will be presented every year.       Key terms used in the act         Child: any person under 18 years of age.            Key terms used in the act                Children in the world: 2.2 billion.

   Action plan on unaccompanied minors (2010-14)     Action plan on unaccompanied minors (2010-14)     This action plan provides a common approach to tackling the challenges relating to the arrival in the European Union (EU) of large numbers of unaccompanied minors. The action plan is based on the principle of the best interests of the child.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council of 6 May 2010 – Action Plan on Unaccompanied Minors (2010 – 2014) [       COM(2010) 213      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     A significant number of unaccompanied minors arrive in the European Union (EU) each year. The term “       unaccompanied minors      ” refers to non-EU country nationals or stateless persons who are below the age of eighteen and who arrive in an EU country unaccompanied by a responsible adult or who are left unaccompanied after having entered an EU country.     Although EU legislative and financial instruments on asylum, immigration and trafficking in human beings address, either directly or indirectly, the situation of unaccompanied minors, greater coherence and better cooperation is needed within the EU as well as with countries of origin and transit. In order for the EU and its countries to respond more effectively, a       common approach      needs to be established that respects the rights of the child provided by the       EU Charter of Fundamental Rights      and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) and that is based on solidarity between the relevant countries and cooperation with civil society and international organisations.     This action plan identifies several problems and presents a number of solutions relating to the situation of unaccompanied minors. It acknowledges the lack of data on these minors and sets out three main strands for action: prevention, protection and durable solutions.      Data on unaccompanied minors      Comprehensive, reliable and comparable data is paramount to properly assessing and finding appropriate solutions to the situation of unaccompanied minors. Currently, the       regulation on statistics on migration      requires EU countries to only provide data on unaccompanied minors applying for international protection. This limitation needs to be overcome to obtain harmonised and complete statistics on all unaccompanied minors.     The information and data exchanges between EU countries should be improved with the help of existing agencies and networks, such as the       European Migration Network      and the       European Asylum Support Office      . Cooperation with countries of origin and transit should also be improved. To this end, the gathering of information on migration routes and criminal networks is essential. The systematic inclusion of this information in the migration profiles of the countries concerned should also be promoted. Both       Frontex      and       Europol      are already active in their respective fields; however, their roles with regard to data collection and analysis should be further reinforced.      Main strands of action      To effectively deal with the issue of unaccompanied minors, the first action must consist of       preventing      the unsafe migration and trafficking of children. In this context, consideration must be given to the different reasons the minors leave their country/region of origin and come to the EU. Therefore, central to the preventive work is collaboration with countries of origin and transit as well as with civil society and international organisations. Prevention involves four principal areas:      addressing the issue of migration of unaccompanied minors in other policy fields, such as development cooperation, poverty reduction, education, health and human rights;       promoting awareness-raising activities and training relating to early identification and protection of victims targeted at those who are or will be in contact with children in the countries of origin and transit;       promoting awareness-raising activities on the risks relating to irregular migration targeted at children and their families;       supporting the development of comprehensive child protection systems and birth registration systems.      EU and national external cooperation instruments should be used to support activities in these areas. At the same time, it is essential that protection programmes close to countries of origin continue to be financed.     Upon detection at the border or on the territory of the EU, an unaccompanied minor must be placed under appropriate       protection      . While provisions on reinforced protection are included in the relevant EU migration instruments, they are context-specific and do not provide the same standards of reception and assistance. The appointment of a representative for an unaccompanied minor should be guaranteed. It is also paramount to separate minors from adults to prevent (re)victimisation. In addition, minors should be provided with appropriate accommodation; detention should only be used in exceptional cases.     Early profiling of the type of minor, building trust and the use of measures provided by EU legislation are important for:      identifying the minor, assessing his/her age and tracing his/her family;       preventing the minor’s disappearance form care;       identifying/prosecuting the traffickers/smugglers.      In order to find       durable solutions      , each case should be assessed individually, keeping in mind the best interests of the child. An unaccompanied minor may either be:      returned and reintegrated in his/her country of origin, with priority given to voluntary return, in full respect of the safeguards provided by the “         Return Directive        ”;       granted an international protection or other legal status and integrated in the host country;       resettled to an EU country.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 450/2009 — active and intelligent materials and articles intended to come into contact with food   what is the aim of the regulation   It seeks to lay down specific rules for  active   *  and  intelligent   *  materials and articles, which supplement those set out in Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004, the general  regulation on materials and articles intended to come into contact with food  .   It establishes  specific requirements  for the marketing of these materials and articles and sets out the procedure for their authorisation at EU level.   key points    Scope   The regulation applies to  active or intelligent materials and articles  intended to come into contact with food which are placed on the EU market.   Requirements for active and intelligent materials and articles   Active and intelligent materials and articles:   must be suitable and effective for the intended purpose of use;   must not release into the food any  components   *  in sufficient quantity as to  endanger human health  or to bring about an  unacceptable change  in the composition, taste or smell of food;   must not mislead consumers through their labelling, presentation or advertising material.   These specific requirements are without prejudice to EU or national rules applicable to materials and articles to which active or intelligent components are added or into which they are incorporated. Those materials may be subject to other specific legislation, such as Regulation (EU) No  10/2011  on  plastic food contact materials  .   Composition    Once the regulation enters fully into force, only substances which are included in the  Union list of authorised substances  may be used in components of active and intelligent materials and articles. It will enter fully into force after the  European Commission  publishes a list of substances that may be used in the manufacture of active and intelligent components.   The following substances may be used in components of active and intelligent materials and articles without being included in the list:   released active substances, added or incorporated by techniques such as grafting or immobilisation which are used in full compliance with the relevant EU and national rules (for example, legislation on  food additives  and  food enzymes  );   substances used in the components which are  not in direct contact  with food or the environment surrounding the food; and are separated from the food by a functional barrier, and if they are not mutagenic, carcinogenic, or toxic to reproduction or substances produced deliberately in a particle size that exhibits chemical and physical properties that significantly differ from those at a larger scale.      Applications for authorisation of substances constituting the components of active and intelligent materials and articles    Applications for authorisation of substances constituting the components of active and intelligent materials and articles are to be made to the competent authorities of an EU country accompanied by a technical dossier containing the information described in the guide to safety assessment prepared by the  European Food Safety Authority  (EFSA).   The EU country sends the application to EFSA which is responsible for assessing whether the substance meets the above conditions.    Union list of authorised substances   To be included in the Union list, substances constituting the components of active and intelligent materials and articles must meet the requirements that apply to the said products (see above).  The Commission must adopt the Union list after EFSA has delivered its opinion on all substances for which a valid application for market authorisation has been submitted.  The Union list specifies:   the identity of the substance(s);   the function of the substance(s);   the reference number;   if necessary, the conditions of use of the substance(s) or component.    Labelling   Active and intelligent materials and articles:   in contact with food are to be labelled appropriately to allow the consumer to identify the non-edible parts. In this case the words ‘DO NOT EAT’ must be added to the label as well as (if possible) the symbol reproduced in Annex I;   must be labelled so that it is clear that they are active and/or intelligent.   Released active substances are considered as ingredients and must be labelled according to Regulation (EU) No  1169/2011  on the  labelling of foodstuffs  .   Packaging   It should also be noted that Regulation (EC) No  1935/2004  on the  safe packaging of foods  contains some rules directly applicable to active and intelligent materials, including definitions and labelling requirements. It authorises the use of active and intelligent packaging, which can extend the shelf-life of food and give information on its freshness, provided that the packaging does not adversely affect its composition.   Declaration of compliance    Businesses must issue at marketing stages other than at the point of sale to the final consumer, a written declaration of compliance containing the information set out in Annex II to the regulation, whether or not the active and intelligent materials and articles are in contact with food.   This declaration must also be issued for the components intended for the manufacturing of those materials and articles or the substances intended for the manufacturing of those components.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 19 December 2009.   background   For more information, see:    Active and intelligent packaging substances  (  EFSA  )    Food contact materials  (  European Commission  )    EU Guidance to the Commission Regulation (EC) No 450/2009 of 29 May 2009 on active and intelligent materials and articles intended to come into contact with food  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Active materials and articles:  materials and articles intended to extend the shelf-life or to maintain or improve the condition of packaged food. They are designed to deliberately incorporate components that would release substances into or onto the packaged food or the environment surrounding the food.   Intelligent materials and articles:  materials and articles which monitor the condition of packaged food or the environment surrounding the food.   A component:  an individual substance or a combination of individual substances which cause the active and/or intelligent function of a material or article, including the products of an  in situ  reaction of those substances; it does not include the passive parts, such as the material they are added to or incorporated into.
act   Directive 2010/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 July 2010 on the framework for the deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in the field of road transport and for interfaces with other modes of transport.   summary   The aim of eCall is to bring rapid assistance to occupants of a vehicle involved in a serious accident anywhere in the European Union plus Iceland, Norway and Switzerland.  eCall is activated automatically as soon as in-vehicle sensors detect a serious crash. Once set off, the system dials the European emergency number 112, establishes a telephone link to the appropriate emergency call centre and sends details of the accident to the rescue services, including the time of incident, the accurate position of the crashed vehicle and the direction of travel (especially important on motorways and in tunnels). An eCall can also be triggered manually by pushing a button in the car, for example by a witness to a serious accident. Shortly after the accident, emergency services therefore know that there has been an accident and the precise location of the accident.  The data received through the eCall system will allow emergency services to provide assistance to vehicle drivers and passengers more quickly, thus helping to save lives and to treat injuries rapidly. Estimates suggest that eCall could speed up emergency response times by 40% in urban areas and 50% in the countryside, and save up to 2,500 lives a year.  In addition to the road safety benefits, eCall will also have a significant impact on reducing the congestion caused by traffic accidents and on reducing secondary accidents caused by unsecured accident sites It is also expected that the in-vehicle equipment introduced by eCall could be used for other additional emergency and/or added value services, in parallel with or building on the 112-based eCall in-vehicle system.  Directive 2010/40/EU of 7 July 2010 on the framework for the deployment of ITS in the field of road transport and for interfaces with other modes of transport has identified as one of the six priority actions for which binding specifications will have to be elaborated (Art. 6) the harmonised provision for an interoperable EU-wide eCall (art 3 d).

summary of   Directive (EU) 2016/681 on the use of passenger name record (PNR) data for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime   what is the aim of the directive   It aims to regulate the transfer of the passenger name record (PNR) data of passengers on international flights from airlines to the European Union (EU) countries.   It also regulates the processing of these data by EU countries’ competent authorities.   key points    What are PNR data?   They consist of  booking information  stored by airlines in their reservation and departure control systems. The information collected includes:   travel dates;   travel itinerary;   ticket information;   contact details;   means of payment used;   baggage information.    Scope    Each EU country must establish a  Passenger Information Unit  (PIU). A PIU is responsible for:   collecting, storing and processing the data, as well as transferring the data or the results of the processing to the competent national authorities;   exchanging PNR data and the results of processing with other EU countries and  Europol  .     Airlines must provide PIUs in EU countries with the PNR data for  flights entering or departing from the EU  . It also allows — but does not require — EU countries to collect PNR data concerning selected intra-EU flights.   Processing   The data collected may only be processed to  prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute terrorist offences and serious crime  . Data should only be processed in the following cases:   for a pre-arrival assessment of passengers against pre-determined risk criteria and relevant law enforcement databases;   for use in specific investigations/prosecutions;   as input in the development of risk assessment criteria.    Transfer and exchange of data    EU countries should not be able to access the database of airline companies.   PNR data are sent by the airline to the PIU of the EU country concerned.   When necessary and relevant, an EU country must supply PNR data on an identified person to the competent authorities of another EU country.   PNR data may be transferred to a non-EU country under certain specific conditions.    Storage    Data provided by airline carriers must be stored in a database by PIU for  5 years  from the time of its transfer to the EU country in which the flight is landing or departing.   After  6 months  the transferred data must be  ‘depersonalised’  to mask out certain information including;   name;   address and contact information;   all payment information including billing address.     Disclosure of the full PNR information after this 6-month period has expired is only permitted if:   it is reasonably believed to be necessary in order to respond to requests for PNR data made by competent authorities or Europol — on a case-by-case basis and;   it has been approved by a judicial or other national authority competent under national law to verify whether the conditions for disclosure are met.     from when does the directive apply  The directive has applied since 24 May 2016. EU countries have to incorporate it into national law by 25 May 2018.   background   For more information, see:    ‘Passenger Name Record (PNR)’  on the European Commission's website
summary of   Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/856 with regard to the operation of the Innovation Fund   what is the aim of the regulation  The Innovation Fund introduced in Directive  2003/87/EC  is designed to support innovative initiatives as part of  EU emissions trading system (ETS)   *  , the EU’s cornerstone policy to tackle  climate change  by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.This regulation sets out detailed rules about how the fund operates.   key points   The regulation sets out detailed rules for the Innovation Fund, including   operational objectives;   forms of support provided;   application procedure;   how projects are selected;   how the fund is governed;   reporting, monitoring, evaluation, control, and publicity.    Objectives and forms of support   The fund provides financial support for projects demonstrating highly innovative technologies, processes or products with significant potential to reduce GHG emissions, while attracting additional public and private resources.  Support will be in the form of grants, or combining EU grants with financial instruments under the EU’s unified investment support instrument (InvestEU), which replaces the current  European Fund for Strategic Investments  for the period 2021-2027. Funding can also take any of the other forms outlined in Regulation (EU, Euratom)  2018/1046  (the ‘  Financial Regulation  ’), in particular prizes, and procurement.   Application and selection   Applicants are invited to apply for financial support for eligible projects following a call for proposals issued by the  European Commission  after consultation with EU countries. Projects are selected based on criteria including:   the potential to avoid GHG emissions;   degree of innovation of the projects compared to the state of the art;   maturity of planning, business model, financial and legal structure; prospect of concluding the financial close of the project within a pre-defined time period of no more than 4 years;   technical and market potential for widespread application or future cost reductions;   cost efficiency of the project based on a formula balancing costs against GHG emissions avoided, energy generated, or CO  2  stored (  carbon capture  and storage) in the first 10 years of operation.    Governance and administration   The Commission directly manages the Fund’s operation except where implementing bodies are delegated. EU countries are consulted about short-listed projects before any decisions on awards are made.  Entities receiving aid should display on their websites information about projects supported under this regulation, including explicit reference to the Innovation Fund support received, as well as ensuring that coherent, effective and targeted information on the support reaches multiple audiences, including the media and the public.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 17 June 2019.   background   For more information, see:    Innovation Fund  (  European Commission  )    InvestEU  (  European Commission  )    EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS)  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS):  the first, and by far the largest, international system for trading GHG emission allowances, it covers nearly 11,000 power stations and manufacturing plants in the EU, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein, as well as aviation activities.
summary of   Investment Protection Agreement between the EU and Singapore    Decision (EU) 2018/1676 on the signing on behalf of the EU of the Investment Protection Agreement between the EU and Singapore   what is the aim of the agreement and the decision  The EU-Singapore  Investment Protection Agreement (IPA)  will ensure a high level of investment protection, while safeguarding the EU’s and Singapore’s rights to regulate and pursue legitimate public policy objectives, such as the protection of public health, safety and the environment.  The decision marks the signing, on behalf of the EU, of the investment protection agreement (IPA) with Singapore.   key points   The IPA contains all the innovations of the EU’s  new approach to investment protection  and its  enforcement mechanisms  that are not present in the  12 existing bilateral investment treaties  between Singapore and EU countries. A very important feature of the IPA is that it replaces and improves on the 12 existing bilateral investment treaties. The IPA has been negotiated at the same time as a  free trade agreement  .  In line with the objectives set by the negotiating directives, the  European Commission  has ensured that EU investors and their investments in Singapore will be granted  fair and equitable treatment  and not be discriminated against compared to Singaporean investments that are in like situations.  At the same time, the IPA  protects EU investors and their investments  in Singapore from  expropriation   *  , unless it is:   for public purposes;   in accordance with due process of the law;   on a non-discriminatory basis; and   in return for payment of prompt, adequate and effective  compensation  according to a fair market value of the expropriated investment.   The IPA also sets up a modern and reformed  investment dispute resolution mechanism  . This ensures that investment protection rules are followed, and aims to strike a balance between protecting investors in a transparent manner and safeguarding the right of a State to regulate in order to pursue public policy objectives. The standing international and fully independent dispute resolution system, consisting of  permanent First Instance and Appeal Tribunals  , will conduct dispute settlement proceedings in a transparent and impartial manner.   date of entry into force   The agreement was signed on 19 October 2018 and needs to be ratified by all the EU countries before entering into force.   background   See also:    Countries and regions: Singapore  (  European Commission  )    In focus: Free Trade Agreement and Investment Protection Agreement  (  European Commission  )    European Commission proposes signature and conclusion of Japan and Singapore agreements  (  European Commission  )    Key elements of the EU-Singapore trade and investment agreements  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Expropriation:  the nationalisation of an investment through formal transfer of title or outright seizure.   main documents    Investment Protection Agreement  between the EU and Singapore  Council Decision (EU)  2018/1676  of 15 October 2018 on the signing, on behalf of the European Union, of the Investment Protection Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Singapore, of the other part (OJ L 279, 9.11.2018, pp. 1-2)
summary of   Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/1516 setting a flat rate for operations funded by the European Structural and Investment Funds in the research, development and innovation sector   what is the aim of this regulation  It sets out a flat rate for financing operations in the research development and innovation (RDI) sector. It aims to allow the potential net revenues  *  of such operations to be determined in advance and to establish the eligible expenditure of operations in line with common rules for  European Structural and Investment Funds  (ESIF) set out in Regulation (EU) No  1303/2013  .   key points    RDI operations   Operations in the RDI sector include:   strengthening research activities and improving the links between science and business;   supporting the competitiveness and innovation of  small and medium-sized enterprises  ;   promoting  information society  ;   supporting a shift towards a low-carbon economy;   developing a sustainable and efficient transport infrastructure.    Horizon 2020  , the EU research and innovation programme, provides nearly €80 billion of funding available over 7 years (2014 to 2020) — in addition to private investment.   Article 61(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013   Article 61(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 requires that the potential net revenue of an operation to be co-financed by ESIF be determined in advance by one of the following methods chosen by the managing authority for a sector, subsector or type of operation:   an application of a  flat-rate net revenue percentage  for the sector or subsector applicable to the operation; or   a calculation of the  discounted net revenue  of the operation, taking into account:   the reference period appropriate to the sector or subsector applicable to the operation   the profitability normally expected of the category of investment concerned   the application of the ‘polluter-pays’ principle   and, if appropriate, considerations of equity linked to the relative prosperity of the EU country or region concerned.      Flat-rate net revenue   This  delegated regulation  sets out a  20% flat-rate net revenue percentage  for operations in the RDI sector.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 25 October 2015.   background   For more information, see:    Research and innovation  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Net revenue:  cash in-flows directly paid by users for the goods and services provided by the operation, such as charges borne directly by users for the use of infrastructure, sale or rent of land and buildings, or payments for service, less any operating or replacements costs of short-life equipment incurred during the corresponding period.
act   Directive  2002/58/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications).   summary   Information is exchanged through public electronic communication services such as the internet and mobile and landline telephony and via their accompanying networks. These services and networks require specific rules and safeguards to ensure the users’ right to privacy and confidentiality.   what does the directive do  It sets out rules to ensure security in the processing of personal data, the notification of personal data breaches, and confidentiality of communications. It also bans unsolicited communications where the user has not given their consent.   key points   Providers of  electronic communication services  must secure their services by at least:   ensuring personal data are accessed by authorised persons only;   protecting personal data from being destroyed, lost or accidentally altered and from other unlawful or unauthorised forms of processing;   ensuring the implementation of a security policy on the processing of personal data.   The  service provider  must inform the national authority of any personal data breach within 24 hours. If the personal data or privacy of a user is likely to be harmed, they must also be informed unless specifically identified technological measures have been taken to protect the data.  EU countries must ensure the  confidentiality  of communications made over public networks, in particular they must:   prohibit the listening, tapping, storage or any type of surveillance or interception of communications and traffic data without the consent of users, except if the person is legally authorised and in compliance with specific requirements;   guarantee that the storing of information or the access to information stored on user’s personal equipment is only permitted if the user has been clearly and fully informed, among other things, of the purpose and been given the right of refusal.   When traffic data are no longer required for communication or billing, they must be erased or made anonymous.

   Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan)     Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan)     The Commission presents a strategic plan to accelerate the development and deployment of cost-effective low carbon technologies. This plan comprises measures relating to planning, implementation, resources and international cooperation in the field of energy technology.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 22 November 2007 entitled: "A European strategic energy technology plan (SET Plan) - Towards a low carbon future" [       COM(2007) 723      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Energy technology is vital if Europe's objectives for 2020 and 2050 as regards the fight against climate change, security of energy supply and competitiveness of European companies are to be fulfilled.     However, certain constraints hamper the development and widespread application of energy technologies, be they the chronic underinvestment that has affected this sector since the 1980s, significant delays in the marketing of new products, the additional cost often involved without always giving better energy output, legal and administrative obstacle, or their social acceptability.     In addition, faced with competition from certain industrialised countries and emergent economies, the European Union (EU) Member States must adopt an effective joint approach on the subject of energy technologies. The timing of the adoption of such an approach will also determine whether European objectives are met.     The strategic energy technology plan (SET plan) presented by the Commission aims to help achieve European objectives and face up to the challenges of this sector:      in the short term by increasing research to reduce costs and improve performance of existing technologies, and by encouraging the commercial implementation of these technologies. Activities at this level should in particular involve second-generation biofuels, capture, transport and storage of carbon, integration of renewable energy sources into the electricity network and energy efficiency in construction, transport and industry;       in the longer term by supporting development of a new generation of low carbon technologies. The activities to be carried out should focus, among other things, on the competitiveness of new technologies relating to renewable energies, energy storage, sustainability of fission energy, fusion energy, and the development of Trans-European Energy networks.      Implementation of this SET plan will involve collective effort and activities in the private sector, the Member States and the EU, as well as internationally.     The SET plan first of all proposes a new governance method for energy technologies, based on joint strategic planning.     With this in mind, a steering group, created by the Commission in 2008 and made up of representatives of the Member States, will improve coherence by developing joint actions, making resources available and evaluating progress. Also, a European summit on energy technologies is planned for 2009. Furthermore, the Commission will set up a European information system, comprising technology mapping and capacity mapping.     The SET plan also improves the effectiveness of the implementation of the jointly decided actions, so as to take full advantage of the possibilities offered by the European research area and the internal market.     The Commission will therefore gradually launch new European industrial initiatives, in wind energy, solar energy, bio-energy, capture, transport and storage of CO², the electricity network and nuclear fission, which will take the form of public-private partnerships or joint programmes between Member States. Furthermore, the Commission wants to create a European energy research alliance to better coordinate, in terms of programming, the efforts of research centres and universities. A prospective approach will also be adopted to prepare the future development of Trans-European energy networks and systems.     An increase in resources, both financial and human, is another major element of the SET plan. Investment in research and innovation must increase at Community level, through the       research framework programme      of the "Intelligent Energy - Europe" programme and the European Investment Bank, as well as in the Member States, in order to double the overall effort made in the EU within three years. A communication from the Commission will be issued in 2008 on the subject of funding of low carbon technologies. In addition, the training of energy researchers will be promoted and new research and training opportunities will be created, to increase the number and quality of engineers and researchers.     Finally, the SET plan makes provision for intensified international cooperation, in order to promote the development, marketing, deployment and accessibility of low carbon technologies worldwide. The EU should speak more often with one voice on this matter. Cooperation with developed countries will involve public interest research and long-term exploratory research. As for developing countries and emergent economies, cooperation should allow their sustainable development while creating opportunities for European companies; cooperation could be involved, for example, in networking of research centres, large-scale demonstration projects and increased use of the mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol.

summary of   Decision 2005/511/JHA designating Europol as the Central Office for combating euro counterfeiting   what is the aim of the decision  It designates Europol as the central office for combating euro counterfeiting in order to apply effectively the 1929 Geneva  International Convention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency  (Geneva Convention) and to step up cooperation among European Union (EU) countries themselves, and between the EU countries,  Europol  and non-EU countries.   key points   The EU is stepping up cooperation among EU countries and between EU countries and Europol with a view to protecting the euro against counterfeiting at international level. Non-EU countries need a central contact for information on counterfeit euros. All such information is to be brought together for purposes of analysis at Europol, which acts as the Central Office for combating euro counterfeiting pursuant to the Geneva Convention.   Role of Europol    Europol acts as the Central Office for combating euro counterfeiting within the meaning of Article 12 of the Geneva Convention, which states ‘in every country, within the framework of its domestic law, investigations on the subject of counterfeiting should be organised by a central office.’   Within the context of its mandate, Europol:   centralises and processes all information of a nature to facilitate the investigation, prevention and combating of euro counterfeiting and forwards this information to the national central offices of the EU countries;   corresponds directly with the central offices of non-EU countries in accordance with the rules on the transmission of personal data;   forwards, in so far as it considers it expedient, to the central offices of non-EU countries a set of specimens of actual euros;   regularly notifies the central offices of non-EU countries of new currency issued, the withdrawal of currency from circulation, any discovery of counterfeit or falsified euro currency, details of discoveries of counterfeiting, etc.     Where counterfeiting of all other currencies is concerned, the national central offices retain competence.    Applying the 1929 Geneva Convention effectively    The Geneva Convention should be applied more effectively. It lays down effective rules for preventing and combating counterfeiting infringements. The word ‘currency’ refers to banknotes and coins having legal tender.   The  Council  considers it expedient that all EU countries should become contracting parties to the Convention.   from when does the decision apply  It has applied since 16 July 2005.
   Security Research     Security Research     Recent events have placed security at the forefront of political concerns in Europe and throughout the world. Political, social and technological changes have created a fluid security environment, where the risks and vulnerabilities are more diverse and less visible. The new threats which have appeared ignore state borders and target European interests both within and outside the territory of the European Union (EU). The recent terrorist attacks in Europe underline the need to improve security for people throughout Europe. Technology plays a key role in addressing the new security challenges in this field.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - Security Research: The Next Steps [       COM(2004) 590      final - not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     A coherent security research programme at EU level can add significant value to the optimal use of a highly competent industry. Such research should be targeted at the development of interoperable systems, products and services useful for the protection of European citizens, territory and critical infrastructures as well as for peacekeeping activities.     The high-level Group of Personalities set up to advise on a long-term strategy for security research in the EU has given rise to a report which contains the following recommendations:      the establishment of a European Security Research Programme (ESRP), focusing in particular on issues of internal security from 2007 onwards, with funding of at least EUR 1 billion per year. This programme should aim to boost the competitiveness of the European security industries and stimulate the development of the (public and private) market for security products and systems;       the creation of a European Security Research Advisory Board to define strategic lines of action. The Board should consist of high-level experts representing public and private customers, the industry, research organizations and any other relevant stakeholders;       the need for cooperation between European institutions as well as all other stakeholders involved.       THE NEXT STEPS      This Communication sets out the next steps to be taken in terms of security research, namely:      Developing a European security research programme under the EU's 7th Research Framework Programme (2007-2010)      The Commission will initiate an inter-institutional debate for consensus on the ESRP building on the work of the Preparatory Action on security research, which will continue until the end of 2006. This programme should complement both Community programmes and security and defence research activities conducted at national or intergovernmental level.      Consultation and cooperation with stakeholders      The Commission will establish a European Security Research Advisory Board to advise on the content of the ESRP and its implementation. The Commission will ensure the ESRP is coordinated effectively with international organisations such as the United Nations (UN), the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and NATO, and with European organisations such as the European Space Agency (ESA).      Creating an effective institutional framework      The Commission will ensure that the requirements of the European Security Strategy, the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) are fully taken into account in the development of security research. At the same time it will develop cooperation with the European Defence Agency (EDA) and other important Commission policies relating to internal security will be fully taken into account when developing security research.      Awarding contracts and funding relating to security research      The Commission must put in place effective and flexible mechanisms governing contracts, participation and funding, for example to allow co-funding of new technologies by public authorities so as to ensure a high degree of synergy.

   2000-06: support for rural development within the framework of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF)     2000-06: support for rural development within the framework of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF)     Rural development support programmes play an important role in territorial, economic and social cohesion. To this end the European Union (EU) set up this Community framework, which contributed to rural development between 2000 and 2006. It was replaced in 2007 by a new legal framework, although the provisions concerning less-favoured areas will remain in force until 2010.     ACT     Council Regulation (EC) No       1257/1999      of 17 May 1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) and amending and repealing certain Regulations [       see Amending acts      ].     SUMMARY      Scope      This Regulation establishes the framework for Community support for sustainable rural development between 1 January 2000 and 1 January 2007. It accompanies and complements other instruments of the common agricultural policy (CAP) and the Community's structural policy.     The rural development measures eligible under this Regulation fall into two groups:      Accompanying measures introduced by the 1992 reform: early retirement, agri-environment and afforestation, as well as the less-favoured areas scheme;       measures to modernise and diversify agricultural holdings: farm investment, setting-up of young farmers, training, investment aid for processing and marketing facilities, additional assistance for forestry, promotion and conversion of agriculture.       MEASURES ACCOMPANYING THE 1992 CAP REFORM       Early retirement      Support may be granted to farmers over 55 years of age but not yet of retirement age, who decide to stop all commercial farming activity definitively after having practised farming for at least 10 years before stopping. Support is also available to farm workers – family helpers or paid farm workers – of the same age, belonging to a social security scheme, who have devoted at least half of their working time to farm work during the five years before stopping.     The aim of this support is to ensure that older farmers have enough income and can be replaced (provided the holding is profitable) or their land reassigned to non-agricultural uses (e.g. forestry, the creation of ecological reserves, etc.). Farmers who retire early in this way can receive up to €15 000 per year (maximum €150 000 in all) up to the age of 75. If they already receive a retirement pension from a Member State, the support becomes a pension 'top-up'. Farm workers can receive up to €3 500 per year (maximum €35 000 in all) up to normal retirement age.     If the retiring farmer is replaced, the farmer taking over the holding must take over all or part of the land released, possess adequate competence and continue to improve the viability of the holding for at least five years.      Agri-environment and animal welfare      Support can be granted to farmers who use agricultural production methods designed to protect the environment and maintain the countryside (agri-environment) or promote animal welfare in order to help achieve the Community's objectives relating to agriculture, the environment and the welfare of farm animals. It encourages farming methods which are compatible with the protection of the environment, environmental planning in farming practice, extensification, the conservation of farmed environments of high natural value and the upkeep of the landscape.     To qualify for support, farmers enter into agri-environment or animal welfare commitments for at least five years. These commitments must go further than mere customary good practice and offer services which neither market support measures nor compensatory allowances can supply. The aid paid is calculated on the basis of income forgone, additional costs and the financial incentive needed to encourage farmers to make agri-environmental commitments and non-productive investments. However, such aid may not exceed €600 per hectare for annual crops, €900 per hectare for specialised perennial crops, €450 per hectare for non-farm use of land and €500 per livestock unit for animal welfare (€200 in the case of local breeds in danger of being lost to farming).      Food quality      Support for agricultural production methods improves the quality of agricultural products intended for human consumption. Its purpose is to provide assurances to consumers and create added value. It is paid to farmers who participate on a voluntary basis in Community or national quality schemes provided for by Community legislation on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin, certificates of specific character,       organic farming      and       quality wines      . These quality schemes allow full traceability, indicate the specific features of the final product and ensure these are complied with.     Support for food quality takes the form of financial assistance which may be granted for no more than five years and may not exceed €3 000 per farm per year. The amount is determined in the light of the fixed costs associated with participating in quality schemes.     Support may also be granted to producer groups for information, promotion and publicity activities aimed at consumers. It may not exceed 70% of the eligible cost of the activity.      Less-favoured areas and areas subject to environmental constraints      Farmers in areas with natural handicaps may be supported by compensatory allowances to ensure continued and sustainable agricultural land use, preservation of the countryside, and the fulfilment of environmental requirements. Farmers who receive these allowances must undertake to continue their activity for five years in the less-favoured area.     Compensatory allowances must be sufficient to contribute effectively to a compensation for handicaps without leading to overcompensation. They therefore range between €25 and €250 per hectare of farm land, taking account of relevant regional development objectives, natural handicaps, environmental problems and type of holding. Compensatory allowances greater than the maximum amount may be granted provided that the average of all the allowances granted under the programme concerned does not exceed that maximum amount. The Member States may combine several regional programmes for the purposes of paying these allowances.     Less-favoured areas include:      mountainous areas where climatic conditions and steep slopes restrict land use and make working the land more expensive;       areas which are in danger of abandonment and where the land is poor, yield is lower than average and the population is on the decline.      Certain geographical areas, accounting for up to 10% of the area of a Member State, may be treated as "less-favoured areas" because the requirements of environmental protection, upkeep of the countryside, tourism or coastal protection justify maintaining some agricultural activity.      Compliance with standards      Aid may be granted to help farmers to adapt to binding Community standards in the field of the environment, public health, food safety and occupational safety.     Temporary and partial assistance is also available in the case of new national standards based on Community legislation. The flat-rate aid may not exceed €10 000 per year per farm and is granted on a degressive basis for a maximum period of five years from the date on which the standards enter into force. In the case of European Directives which have not been correctly implemented in a Member State, the maximum five-year period runs from 28 October 2003.     Farmers may use farm advisory services as defined in Regulation (EC) No       1782/2003      . In this case the maximum support which may be granted is 80% of the eligible costs, up to €1 500.      MEASURES TO MODERNISE AND DIVERSIFY AGRICULTURAL HOLDINGS       Investments in agricultural holdings      Support for investments in agricultural holdings is granted to improve farmers' incomes and living, working and production conditions. The purpose of these investments must be to reduce production costs, improve or diversify productive activities (except those for which there are no market outlets), as well as promote product quality, the natural environment, health and hygiene conditions or animal welfare.     Only economically viable farms which comply with minimum environmental, hygiene and animal welfare standards, and where the farmer possesses adequate competence, are eligible. The conditions relating to investment aid must be met at the date on which the individual decision granting aid is adopted. When investments are made in order to comply with new standards, farmers may be granted aid and a period of grace.     Although the total amount of aid granted may not exceed 40% of the investment, the ceiling is set at 50% in less-favoured areas. These percentages may be increased to 50% and 60% respectively for no more than five years from the date of installation in the case of young farmers less than 40 years of age.      Setting-up of young farmers      The aid for young farmers targets heads of holdings who are under 40 years of age, possess adequate competence and are setting up in farming for the first time. Their holdings must be viable and comply with minimum environmental, hygiene and animal welfare standards.     The aid consists either of a single premium of up to €25 000, or an interest subsidy on loans taken on with a view to covering the costs of setting up. In such cases, the amount of the interest subsidy may not exceed the value of the single premium, except in the case of young farmers using agricultural advisory services, during a three-year period, for which the ceiling is €30 000.      Vocational training      Support for vocational training is intended to improve the occupational skills and competence of farmers and other persons involved in agricultural and forestry activities to help them redeploy production in qualitative terms, apply production practices compatible with the upkeep and improvement of the landscape, to help protect the environment and meet the standards applicable to hygiene and animal welfare, and manage holdings more effectively.      Improving processing and marketing of agricultural products      Companies which are economically viable and comply with minimum environmental, hygiene and animal welfare standards may receive support for investments to improve and rationalise the processing and marketing of agricultural products. Small processing units may also receive aid, and an additional period of grace in which to comply with newly adopted minimum standards. The goal is to increase the competitiveness and added value of agricultural products by improving their presentation, rationalising processing procedures and marketing channels, reorienting production to new outlets, developing and applying new technologies, monitoring quality and health conditions, encouraging innovation and protecting the environment. No support is available for investments at the retail level or investments in the processing or marketing of products from third countries.     Community support may cover up to 50% of eligible investments in Objective 1 regions and up to 40% in other regions. It must in all cases contribute to improving the situation of the basic agricultural sector.      Forestry      In the light of the undertakings made by the Community and the Member States at international level and the Member States' forestry programmes, support may be granted to private individuals, municipalities and associations thereof who own woodland. Such aid may contribute to:      improving non-farm land: measures include afforestation, investments to enhance the value of forests and improve the harvesting, processing and marketing of forestry products, open up new outlets for forestry products, promote joint action by forest owners and assist the recovery of forestry production as a result of natural disasters or fire and set up appropriate preventive measures;       afforestation of farm land: an annual premium per hectare may be granted to cover the costs of planting and maintenance and to compensate farmers for income forgone. Aid may total up to €725, or €185 per hectare per year, depending on the nature of the farmer's activity. Support for the afforestation of agricultural land belonging to public authorities covers only the cost of establishment. No aid is granted to farmers receiving early-retirement aid or for planting Christmas trees;       preserving woodlands (where the protective and ecological role of the forests is in the public interest and the cost of the preventive measures exceeds the income from forestry) and maintaining fire breaks: support for these measures can vary between €40 and €120 per hectare per year.      In the case of woodland classified as having a high or medium risk of forest fire, the measures must comply with national plans under       European legislation on the protection of forests      .      Facilitating the development and structural adjustment of rural areas      Community support may also be granted to activities not covered by the above measures, but which contribute to converting and improving farming activities. Such activities include land reparcelling, setting up farm advisory services, marketing high-quality agricultural products, developing key services in rural areas, renovating villages and protecting heritage, promoting tourism and craft activities and managing integrated rural development strategies by local partnerships.     No aid may be granted for reparcelling in the ten new Member States. However, aid may be granted to help farmers to comply with a European standard set before the date of accession (1 May 2004) and binding on farmers from that date or a later date. This possibility is limited to the first three years of the support period, up to a maximum annual ceiling of €25 000 per farm.      GENERAL AND FINAL PROVISIONS       EAGGF financing      Between €4 300 and €4 370 million will be allocated each year to rural development and accompanying measures during the period 2000-06. These measures are financed by the EAGGF Guarantee Section or Guidance Section, depending on their regional context. Thus, the EAGGF Guarantee Section covers support for early retirement, less-favoured areas and areas with environmental restrictions, agri-environment measures, animal welfare, food quality and afforestation of farmland. The other rural development measures are financed by the EAGGF Guidance Section in Objective 1 areas and by the Guarantee Section in regions not covered by Objective 1. The Commission may extend the scope of the measures eligible for financial assistance from the EAGGF Guidance Section and propose the financing of studies relating to programming by the EAGGF Guarantee Section.     Lastly, the EAGGF also covers measures for the development and structural adjustment of rural areas relating to the renovation and development of villages, the protection and conservation of rural heritage, the diversification of farm activities and the improvement of infrastructure relating to the development of farming which are not financed by the       European Regional Development Fund      (ERDF) under       Objective 1      and       Objective 2      and in areas in transition.      Compatibility and coherence      Rural development measures must be compatible with Community law and consistent with other Community policies. Such consistency is especially important in the case of the CAP provisions on the common market organisations and measures on quality and health in agriculture. No aid may be granted under this Regulation for measures to support research projects or eradicate animal diseases.     In addition, measures receiving financial assistance under this Regulation may not receive aid under any other Community support scheme. Moreover, any measure which is incompatible with a specific condition laid down in this Regulation will not be eligible for support under other Community support schemes.     Rural development aid granted by the Member States must comply with the Community rules on State aids in agriculture and the ceilings fixed by the Council in the agricultural regulations and directives (above such ceilings, national aids must be notified by the Member States and approved by the Commission) and with the Community rural development rules. Thus:      State aids for investments that exceed the percentages laid down for Community aid are prohibited, except in the case of investments to improve the environment, hygiene and animal welfare in the general interest;       aid to compensate for natural handicaps must always comply with the Community rules;       agri-environment aid must comply with the Community conditions and limits, although these may be exceeded where necessary to properly cover the loss of income, additional costs, etc.       Geographical coverage and programming      To ensure that all rural areas in the Community are covered by the rural development policy, the measures provided for in this Regulation are included in the following multiannual programmes:      Objective 1 programmes: measures financed by the EAGGF Guidance Section;       Objective 2 programmes: measures relating to early retirement, less-favoured areas and areas subject to environmental constraints, agri-environment measures and afforestation of farm land;       rural development programmes: all other measures.      Rural development programmes are based on plans drawn up by the Member States at the most appropriate geographical level for a seven-year period (2000-06). These plans describe the current situation, the proposed strategy, the expected impact, the financial planning, the planned measures, including agri-environment measures, the necessary studies and technical measures, the competent authorities and the provisions required to implement the plan effectively. The Member States presented their rural development plans to the Commission not later than six months after the entry into force of this Regulation, and the Commission adopted them within six months of their submission.      Financial provisions      The Regulation on the       financing of the common agricultural policy      applies to rural development measures, except in the case of certain measures covered by Objective 2.     Now that financial planning has been included in the programming, the Commission fixes the initial allocations to the Member States, broken down by year, on the basis of needs and efforts to be undertaken. They can be adjusted in the light of actual expenditure and any expenditure reviews carried out by the Member States.     With regard to rates of assistance, the Community must contribute at least 25% of eligible public expenditure, without exceeding 50% of the total eligible cost. In accordance with the       general rules on the Structural Funds      , this contribution rises, in the case of agri-environment measures, to 85% in Objective 1 regions and 60% elsewhere. Revenue-generating investments are governed by specific provisions.      Monitoring and evaluation      The Member States are responsible for ensuring effective monitoring of implementation of rural development programming by means of physical and financial indicators agreed with the Commission, setting up monitoring committees where necessary. The results of monitoring are forwarded to the Commission in annual reports.     Evaluation is carried out in accordance with the Regulation on the financing of the common agricultural policy.      Implementing rules      At a later date, the Commission must adopt detailed rules on the conditions for granting support, the calculation of allowances and the periods and conditions to be applied, as well as the implementing provisions for the rural development plans, the revision of programmes, financial planning, monitoring and evaluation and the coherence between rural development and the market organisations.     Further information is available in the       "Rural Development" section      of the Directorate-General for Agriculture website.     During the 2000-06 programming period, the Community Initiative       Leader+      is promoting the implementation of integrated, original strategies for sustainable rural development. It focuses on local partnership and promotes networking in rural areas.

   Copyright in the Knowledge Economy     Copyright in the Knowledge Economy     Technical progress has made information more accessible, in particular through the Internet. For this reason, it is now necessary to adapt the legal framework for copyright to recent technological developments. This Communication therefore examines possible avenues for future action concerning the digitisation of works, the processing of orphan works, access for persons with disabilities and the protection of new creators of online content.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 19 October 2009 - Copyright in the Knowledge Economy [       COM(2009) 532      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     After having analysed the responses generated by the       Green Paper on Copyright in the Knowledge Economy      , in this Communication the European Commission announces a series of actions to be implemented in the area of intellectual property rights.      What are the positions of the different stakeholders concerned?      The Commission collected 372 responses from the consultation launched by the Green Paper. The analysis of the responses shows radically opposed positions among the following key stakeholders:       archives, libraries and universities        favour a wider-ranging copyright system, as well as a system of “public interest” exceptions to facilitate access to works;        publishers, collecting societies and other right-holders        favour the status quo as regards copyright, and prefer contracts which can be adapted to each case and which take account of new technologies.       What is the Commission's strategy in terms of copyright?       Libraries and archives       Digital copies      and       electronic dissemination      of digitised works represent the two main challenges for libraries and archives. Currently, the digitisation of a library collection is subject to prior approval from right-holders, and the dissemination of works online can only be performed on library premises.     The Commission therefore intends to continue working at European level towards clarifying the legal implications of mass-scale digitisation and providing solutions to the issue of transaction costs for right clearance.      Orphan Works       Orphan works      are works that are in copyright but whose right-holders cannot be identified or located. They cannot be exploited because it is       impossible to obtain prior permission from the right-holders      . Consequently, these works cannot be included in digitisation projects such as the       Europeana      library. Although the Commission published a       Recommendation on the online digitisation of cultural material      in 2006, and the Memorandum of Understanding on Orphan Works in 2008, there is no binding legal framework in this field at present.     The Commission plans to launch an impact assessment to explore a variety of approaches to facilitate the digitisation and dissemination of orphan works. Several options are being considered, including a legally binding stand-alone instrument on the clearance and mutual recognition of orphan works (this would be an exception to the provisions of       Directive 2001/29/EC      ), or guidance on cross-border mutual recognition of orphan works.      Teaching and research      Enabled by new information and communication technologies, teaching and research is already widely internationalised. It is therefore important that copyright on books and publications does not hinder the development of these sectors. To this end, different processes in       scientific publishing      and       publishing for literary and artistic aims      are being envisaged. Furthermore, the Commission proposes to facilitate the acquisition and use of material for scientific research. Currently, the system is based on licence agreements concluded with publishers. The Commission wishes to consolidate best practice in this field in order to achieve a less fragmented system of usage rights to journals.      Persons with disabilities      The       United Nations Convention on the rights of Persons with Disabilities      stipulates that these persons have a fundamental right to enjoy       equal access to information products, publications and cultural material in an accessible format      . However, persons with disabilities have very limited access to these works for the moment (5 % of books published in Europe are converted into accessible formats). Moreover, the cross-border transfer of this type of material is hampered by the territorial limitation of copyright exceptions under national legislation.     The Commission’s main goal is to encourage publishers to make more works accessible to disabled persons. In this regard, the organisation of a forum bringing together the stakeholders concerned will foster solutions to give persons with disabilities better access to works while ensuring that right-holders are adequately remunerated for the use of their work.      User-created content (UCC)      With the development of Internet applications, users can now       produce      and       share      text, videos and pictures or       create content      , sometimes using copyright-protected material.     However, this phenomenon of content creation by Internet users is still quite recent. For this reason, the Commission intends to analyse the needs of this type of user further with regard to protecting their rights.     Last updated: 09.07.2010  
   Rear-view mirrors and supplementary devices for indirect vision (until 2014)     Rear-view mirrors and supplementary devices for indirect vision (until 2014)     The European Union intends to improve the safety of road users by reducing "blind spots". New provisions concerning the installation of more effective rear-view mirrors and/or the accelerated introduction of new technologies will enlarge the field of indirect vision of drivers of passenger cars, buses, coaches and trucks.     ACT     Directive       2003/97/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 November 2003 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of devices for indirect vision and of vehicles equipped with these devices, amending Directive       70/156/EEC      and repealing Directive 71/127/EEC [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     Serious traffic accidents often take place at crossroads, junctions and roundabouts due to drivers being unaware of the presence of other road users near their vehicles. Such accidents are more serious when heavy vehicles (trucks, buses, coaches) or vulnerable road users (pedestrians, cyclists, moped users) are involved.     So as to prevent such accidents, the European Union has adopted measures which aim to reduce blind spots in the immediate area around vehicles.     In the light of current technology, the provisions of Directive       71/127/EEC      on rear-view mirrors are no longer adequate as regards the exterior field of vision to the side, front and rear of vehicles. Directive       2003/97/EC      builds on the existing provisions so as to ensure that the field of vision is extended. In particular, it amends Directive       71/127/EEC      , which it will replace and repeal with effect from 26 January 2010.     Directive       2003/97/EC      harmonises the provisions concerning the type-approval of devices for indirect vision and of vehicles equipped with these devices.     The new requirements introduced by the Directive principally relate to:      an increase in the compulsory minimum field of vision for certain vehicles;       the installation of supplementary devices for indirect vision in certain vehicles (e.g. front mirrors on trucks);       adaptations to technical progress (e.g. the curvature of the surface of rear-view mirrors);       the replacement of some rear-view mirrors with other indirect vision systems (e.g. camera-monitor devices).      The new rules laid down in Directive       2003/97/EC      will be implemented progressively. The timetable for introducing the new requirements thus runs from 2005 to 2010.     The vehicles covered by the Directive are motor vehicles of category M (passenger vehicles) and category N (goods vehicles).     Finally, the Commission will carry out a study in 2010 to determine the impact on road safety of the measures introduced by this Directive, particularly as regards vulnerable road users. Additional legislative measures might be proposed on the basis of the conclusions of this study.     Directive       2003/97/EC      participates in the efforts of the European road safety action programme to halve the number of road accident victims in the European Union by 2010 .      References           Act               Entry into force - Date of expiry               Deadline for transposition in the Member States               Official Journal               Directive                 2003/97/EC                29.1.2004               25.1.2005               OJ L 25 of 29.1.2004               Amending act(s)               Entry into force               Deadline for transposition in the Member States               Official Journal               Directive                 2005/27/EC                19.4.2005               19.10.2005               OJ L 81 of 30.3.2005          RELATED ACTS      Directive         2007/38/EC        of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2007 on the retrofitting of mirrors to heavy goods vehicles registered in the Community [Official Journal L 184 of 14.07.2007].      The Directive extends the obligation to install devices for the lateral field of indirect vision to the entire existing fleet of heavy goods vehicles (vehicles of categories N2 and N3).     Directive       2003/97/EC      requires new vehicles to be fitted with devices for indirect vision to reduce the blind spot, but it does not apply to vehicles already in circulation. However, it can be estimated that the entire fleet of heavy goods vehicles already in circulation will not have been fully replaced until 2023. In the interim, in order to minimise the risk to vulnerable road users (pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists) of being involved in an accident with a heavy goods vehicle performing a right turn, heavy goods vehicles already in circulation must be retrofitted with rear-view mirrors reducing the lateral blind spots while fulfilling the technical requirements of Directive       2003/97/EC      .     Heavy goods vehicles of over 3.5 tonnes and registered after 1 January 2000 should thus no later than 31 March 2009 be fitted with lateral rear-view mirrors reducing the blind spot. In order to pass the compulsory annual roadworthiness test imposed by       Directive 96/96/EC      , heavy goods vehicles must therefore be fitted with rear-view mirrors that comply with Directive       2007/38/EC      .     For the majority of vehicles, the retrofitting can be done at reasonable cost and with devices which are already available on the market. However, to ensure that the retrofitting costs are not higher than the expected benefits, exemptions are provided for vehicles used principally for their historical interest and for vehicles which are equipped with lateral mirrors whose field of vision covers only marginally less than the fields of vision laid down in Directive       2003/97/EC      .     Member States must have transposed Directive       2007/38/EC      by 6 August 2008. The Commission will present an evaluation report on its implementation no later than four years after the Directive has entered into force. The same safety rules may therefore be extended to vehicles that are not covered, such as light commercial vehicles or passenger buses.     Last updated: 13.08.2007  
   Sixth Framework Programme (2000-2006): Information Society Technologies     Sixth Framework Programme (2000-2006): Information Society Technologies     This specific programme aims to stimulate the development of hardware and software technologies and applications in order to strengthen the competitiveness of European industry and allow European citizens the possibility of benefiting from a knowledge-based society.     ACT     Council Decision       2002/835/EC      of 30 September 2002 adopting a specific programme for research, technological development and demonstration: "Integrating and strengthening the European Research Area" (2002-2006) [Official Journal L 294 of 29.10.2002].     SUMMARY     In 2000, the Lisbon European Council referred to the development of an       information society      as a fast way forward towards a competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.     This led to the       eEurope 2002      initiative, which was launched by the European Commission to promote the achievement of an "information society for all". At the same time, the       eEurope 2005      initiative is responsible for ensuring that information society applications and services are accessible to every citizen, home, school and business by 2010.     Information and communications technologies create new methods of production, trade and communications. This sector has become the second largest of the Union's economy and employs more than 2 million people in Europe. In this respect, the       Sixth Framework Programme      attempts to meet the demands and needs of the markets, government policies and citizens.     To maximise the effort in this field economically and socially, the future generation of technology will be more integrated into the environment and more accessible, offering a multitude of services and applications more easily.     The ultimate aim is to introduce more user-friendly technologies in all areas: personal security and privacy, teaching and training, access for the elderly and the disabled, tele-working, electronic commerce and administration, on-line health (e-health), intelligent transport, etc.     The total amount of the "       Information society technologies      " programme is 3.625 million. The 2003-2004 work programme amounts to a total of 1.725 billion. A budget of some 90 million has been set aside for participants in the following countries: Russia and the newly independent States, the Mediterranean countries, including the western Balkans, and the developing countries. Two calls for proposals are planned to cover this budget.     The actions undertaken address the following four technological priorities:      A) Integrating research into technological areas of priority interest for citizens and businesses      The aim is to find solutions for the major societal and economic changes faced by an emerging knowledge-based society, including the consequences for work and the workplace environment.     The research activities focus on the following areas:      research on technologies which guarantee the security and confidentiality of computer systems and the rights and privacy of citizens;       the development of "ambient intelligence" systems which improve access to the information society for everyone, in particular the elderly and disabled;       the development of on-line electronic commerce, new tools and methods of work, technologies for learning, integrated business management, etc.;       the development of large-scale database and global resource systems in areas such as the environment, energy, health, transport, etc.       B) Communication and computing infrastructures      The aim is to develop mobile, wireless, optical and broadband technologies that are reliable, of wide application and can be adapted to meet the needs of citizens.     Research will focus on the development of:      research on the new generation of communications systems and networks to prepare for the next Internet generation;       the development of technologies that involve multiple actors, and the engineering and control of complex, large-scale systems.       C) Components and microsystems      The aim is to increase research on miniaturised and low-cost components based on new materials. The research focuses on:      the production of nano/micro components in order to allow a very high degree of miniaturisation of systems (small size, lightness, fewer connections and low-energy consumption);       research on nano-electronics, microtechnologies, displays, new materials, and computing equipment and models.       D) Information management and interfaces      The aim is to develop management tools to enable easier interaction everywhere and at all times with knowledge-based services and applications. Work focuses on the following areas:      the development of knowledge representation and management systems based on context and semantics, including cognitive systems, tools for creating, organising, navigating, retrieving, etc.       the development of multi-sensorial interfaces which react intelligently to words, language, sight, gestures, touch and the other senses.

summary of   Directive 2007/59/EC on the certification of train drivers operating locomotives and trains on the EU railway system   what is the aim of the directive  It sets out the requirements and procedures for the certification of train drivers operating locomotives and trains on the EU railway system.   key points   When implementing the directive, EU countries may exclude train drivers who operate exclusively on:   metros, trams and other light rail systems;   networks separate from the rest of the rail system which are intended only for local, urban and suburban passenger and freight services;   privately owned railway infrastructure;   sections of railway track temporarily closed to normal traffic.    Certification of drivers   Drivers must have the necessary fitness and qualifications. They must also hold the following documents:    a licence  confirming that a driver meets minimum requirements for medical and psychological fitness, basic education and general professional skills;    a harmonised complementary certificate  indicating the  infrastructure (railways) and rolling stock (types of train)  for which the driver is authorised.    Obtaining a licence and a certificate    Applicants must meet the following requirements:   be at least 20 years old, although EU countries may issue licences limited to their own territory to drivers from the age of 18;   have received basic training and satisfy the medical requirements laid down in the Directive;   provide evidence of physical fitness by passing a medical examination conducted by a medical doctor recognised by the competent authority;   demonstrate psychological fitness by passing an examination conducted by a psychologist recognised by the competent authority;   provide evidence of their professional and, if applicable, linguistic abilities.     The competent authority must issue the licence within 1 month of receiving the necessary documents. The licence is valid for  10 years  .   The complementary certificates are issued by the employers of train drivers, i.e. railway undertakings or infrastructure managers.    What is the role of national competent authorities?   The authority appointed by an EU country to issue the train driver’s licence has a number of tasks including:   issuing and updating licences, providing replacements and suspending and withdrawing licences if necessary;   ensuring periodic examinations and checks;   ensuring the publication and updating of a register of accredited or recognised persons and bodies (medical doctors, trainers, examiners, etc.);   keeping and updating a register of licences which have been issued, modified, suspended, cancelled or declared lost or destroyed, or which have expired;   supervising the process of certifying drivers and carrying out the necessary checks on board trains travelling within the EU.    Railway companies must:    keep a register of all harmonised complementary certificates issued, expiring, modified, suspended, cancelled or declared lost or destroyed;   set up a system to monitor their drivers and take immediate action if a driver’s fitness for the job is called into question.   By  29 October 2018  , all drivers must hold licences and certificates that comply with this directive.   Amendments to Directive 2007/59/EC   The directive has been amended on several occasions:   by Directive  2014/82/EU  which includes minor changes to the requirements for issuing a licence and a certificate in order to ensure  uniform application  across all EU countries;   by Directive (EU)  2016/882  and by Regulation (EU)  2019/554  which amend Annex VI to the directive concerning  language requirements  for train drivers;   Regulation (EU)  2020/698  which lays down specific and temporary measures in view of the  COVID-19 pandemic  concerning the renewal or extension of certain certificates, licences and authorisations and the postponement of certain periodic checks and periodic training in certain areas of transport legislation. The regulation extends the time limits laid down in Directive 2007/59/EC by 6 months.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 4 December 2007 and had to become law in the EU countries by 3 December 2009.   background   For more information, see:    Train drivers  (  European Union Agency for Railways  ).
   Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion 2006     Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion 2006     This Report identifies the various overarching issues facing social protection and social inclusion in the future, and describes changing social realities in Europe, particularly in the areas of fighting poverty and exclusion, and in pensions and health care. It also offers ways of achieving the objectives set by the revised Lisbon Strategy, against a background of change. The Open Method of Coordination (OMC) remains the preferred instrument for this purpose.     ACT     Communication from the Commission, of 13 February 2006, to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion 2006 [       COM (2006) 62      final - Official Journal C 67 of 18.03.2006].     SUMMARY     The European Union (EU) and its social policies face major challenges in the medium to long term.     In the long run, the challenges of global competition, the impact of new technologies and an ageing population need to be addressed.     More immediate action is needed to boost sluggish growth, curb high rates of unemployment and reduce continuing inequalities.      Social protection and social inclusion: developments and reforms      After several years of stagnation, the percentage of GDP (28% in 2003) spent on social protection has now risen slightly.     Systems of cash transfers (other than pensions) account for 5% of GDP. In this area, reforms have been undertaken with a view to strengthening incentives to take up work. Benefits to support incomes for those making the transition to (low-paid) employment are also becoming more widespread. Social assistance is increasingly linked closely with social and employment services, thus achieving synergies and increasing efficiency. Moreover, notable reform efforts were made in relation to long-term sickness/invalidity schemes.     Spending on pensions, which averaged 13% of GDP in the EU in 2003, has ensured that being old is no longer associated with being poor or being dependent. Furthermore, in the light of population ageing and the increase in life expectancy in Europe, most Member States have undertaken reforms to ensure the adequacy, sustainability and modernisation of pensions. The National Strategy Reports which Member States submitted in 2005 show that these three objectives must be viewed together in order for the reforms to succeed. Member States have therefore adopted a three-pronged strategy based on:      reducing public debt;       higher employment rates among older people;       reforming pensions.      In 2003, spending on health care and long-term care averaged 8% of GDP. At present this area is directly affected by the consequences of ageing and the emergence of new technologies. In 2004 the Open Method of Coordination (MOC) was extended to include health care and long-term care, areas which continue to pose challenges in terms of supply, access and financial sustainability. In response to ever-growing demand, in order to guarantee access to health care for all and also to overcome the quantitative and qualitative gaps in supply, Member States have undertaken various reforms:      ensuring greater effectiveness and efficiency through reorganisation, prioritisation and the development of incentive structures for users and providers;       strengthening the role of health promotion and disease prevention policies;       systematic use of charges and co-payments as well as reductions in fees, targeted at disadvantaged groups;       promoting active lifestyles and healthy ageing;       developing indicators and setting quality standards, practice guidelines and accreditation systems;       involving patients;       promoting choice;       technological progress.      With regard to fighting poverty and exclusion, considerable progress has been made in several areas. However, like the economic situation, the picture remains mixed. Moreover, the review of the Lisbon Strategy revealed an implementation gap between what Member States committed to and the policy effort to implement them. There are eight problem areas in which action must be taken:      labour market participation, which is generally low;       modernisation of social protection systems;       disadvantages in education and training;       child poverty, which still persists;       assistance to families;       housing, an area where significant inequalities persist;       access to quality services;       integration of people with disabilities, ethnic minorities and immigrants.      Intervention was also necessary in light of the concentration of multiple disadvantages in certain urban and rural communities and among some groups (people with disabilities, migrants and ethnic minorities, homeless, ex-prisoners, addicts and older people).      Social protection and social inclusion: challenges      The Commission's January 2006 Communication on a       new framework for the OMC      identifies four overarching challenges for social protection and inclusion policies:      to promote social cohesion and equal opportunities for all through adequate, accessible, financially sustainable, adaptable and efficient social protection systems and social inclusion policies;       to interact closely with the Lisbon objectives on achieving greater economic growth and more and better jobs and with the EU's Sustainable Development Strategy;       to strengthen governance, transparency and the involvement of stakeholders in the design, implementation and monitoring of policy;       finally, there should be a two-way         interaction between the OMC and the Lisbon Strategy        . Social protection and inclusion policies should support growth and employment objectives, and, conversely, growth and employment policies should support social objectives.      For social protection schemes a holistic approach is required which focuses on:      sustainability;       monitoring the effectiveness and efficiency of systems, policies and funding mechanisms;       the distribution of spending across different branches;       the balance between public provision and self-reliance.      With regard to pension schemes, it is necessary to:      further highlight the interlinkages between the three broad objectives of adequacy, sustainability and modernisation of pension systems;       continue to remove disincentives and strengthen incentives for working longer (including for potential beneficiaries of minimum pensions);       improve the way in which both employers and labour markets treat older workers;       monitor the trend towards a decline in replacement rates;       take better account of new forms of working and of career breaks (particularly for care);       ensure that women can build up their own pension rights;       ensure that private pension schemes are affordable and secure, so that they can complement public schemes (which are the principal source of pensions in all but a few Member States) as effectively as possible.      With regard to health care and long-term care:      in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, there is a need for greater coherence and better coordination between different types of care;       in terms of access and quality, action must be taken to strengthen the role of family doctors;       in terms of financial sustainability, it is recommended to boost incentives to use resources in a rational way, and to ensure greater use of regulated competition.      The chapter on the challenges for the future in relation to fighting poverty and exclusion highlights a threefold need:      better mainstreaming;       better governance;       better links between the NAPs for inclusion and the Structural Funds (in particular the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund).      Still in relation to fighting poverty and exclusion, a more strategic, systematic and transparent approach is needed for the formulation of NAPs for inclusion, to ensure that policies are set out more clearly. The OMC needs to develop a strong focus on poverty among children and their families. The multiple exclusion faced by young people from ethnic minorities in poor neighbourhoods also needs increased attention. In this context, the fundamental role of education and training in breaking the intergenerational transmission of poverty should be highlighted.     It is essential to ensure that the OMC and the revised Lisbon Strategy mutually reinforce one another. Monitoring and evaluation also need to be strengthened.      Background      This second Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion responds directly to the       challenges of the Lisbon Strategy      and of the Hampton Court Summit, and builds on the 2003 Communication "       Strengthening the social dimension of the Lisbon strategy: Streamlining open coordination in the field of social protection      ". It draws on the plans and policy statements produced by the Member States during 2005 under the three policy strands of social inclusion, pensions, and health and long-term care. It is guided by the views expressed by Member States and stakeholders on the value of the OMC.

summary   This Directive establishes a framework for labelling and consumer information regarding energy consumption for energy-related products .   Which products are concerned?   The Directive shall apply to products which are likely to have a direct or indirect impact on the consumption of energy and on other potential resources during use. It does not apply to:   second-hand products;   any means of transport for persons or goods;   product rating plates.   Furthermore, Directive 2012/27/EU, amending Directive 2010/30/EU, establishes a common framework to promote energy efficiency in the Union. The Member States are therefore encouraged to implement cumulative energy efficiency measures rather than energy efficiency measures for each individual product.   What sort of information must be provided?   Suppliers shall place on the market products that have a label containing information on the product’s consumption of electric energy or other forms of energy.  Suppliers must also make available technical documentation including:   a general description of the product;   the results of design calculations carried out;   test reports;   the references allowing identification of similar models.   The technical documentation must be available for a period of five years.  Suppliers shall provide dealers with labels and product information free of charge.  Dealers must affix labels in such a way that they are visible and legible.   What are the conditions for distance selling?   In some situations, the final consumer does not see the product – in particular when purchasing by mail order, by catalogue or through the Internet. However, the consumer must have access to product information through delegated acts which specify the way in which the label or the fiche is displayed or provided to the end-user.   What is the function of delegated acts?   A delegated act shall indicate in particular:   a description of the product;   measurement standards and methods;   details of the technical documentation;   the design and content of the label. The classification of the product on the label shall be indicated using the letters A to G. The most efficient class shall be represented by A+++. A scale with a maximum of seven colours shall also be used, and dark green shall always represent the maximum level of efficiency;   the location where the label shall be fixed to the product;   the duration of label classification.   If a product is covered by a delegated act, contracting authorities which conclude public works, supply or service contracts as referred to in  Directive 2004/18/EC  shall procure products which comply with high performance levels, expressed as ‘energy classes’. These criteria are as follows:   products which allow significant energy savings to be made;   equivalent products on the market shall have a wide disparity in performance levels;   the Commission shall take into account relevant EU legislation and self-regulation.   A delegated act shall take into account environmental parameters.  The European Commission has the power to adopt delegated acts for a period of five years from 19 June 2010. The period shall be renewed automatically unless the European Parliament or the Council revoke this right. These two institutions also have the power to object to a delegated act.   Transitional provisions   Member States shall apply the provisions of the Directive from 20 July 2011. This Directive repeals  Directive 92/75/EEC  from 21 July 2011.    Reference            Act     Entry into force     Deadline for transposition in the Member States     Official Journal       Directive  2010/30/EU      19.6.2010     20.6.2011     OJ L 153 of 18.6.2010         Amending act             Act     Entry into force     Transposition in the Member States     Official Journal       Directive  2012/27/EU      4.12.2012     5.6.2014     OJ L 315 of 14.11.2012
   Corporate and financial malpractice     Corporate and financial malpractice     The aim of this Communication is to provide a holistic approach on how to reduce the risk of financial and corporate malpractice covering also taxation and law enforcement.     There are four lines of "defence" against corporate malpractice: internal control in a company, independent third parties, and supervision and enforcement.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 27 September 2004 on preventing and combating corporate and financial malpractice [       COM(2004) 611      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This Communication is the Commission's response to the Enron and Parmalat financial scandals that caused immense disruption to capital markets. The Commission is aware that there is an effective EU framework for dealing effectively with most of the financial issues raised, viz. the       Financial Services Action Plan      (FSAP) and the existing action plans (       COM(2003) 284      ), and it sets out in this Communication a holistic strategy covering financial services, internal issues, justice and tax policy.     The Commission identifies four lines of "defence" against corporate malpractice that focus on a series of measures involving matters ranging from the internal control in a company, through auditors and supervision to measures necessary to comply with the law.      First line of defence - internal control in a company and corporate governance      Boards of companies have fiduciary obligations towards the company itself and its shareholders as well as obligations towards stakeholders at large.     Before the end of 2004 the Commission will take the following measures:      enhance transparency of intra-group transactions as well as of transactions with related parties;       clarify the responsibilities of board members for financial statements and key non-financial information;       oblige all listed companies to make public annually a corporate governance statement.      The Commission will look into:      after 2006, criteria for the disqualification of directors and wrongful trading;       the use of bearer shares and bonds, which can be used to blur the ultimate beneficial owners;       bond market transparency in accordance with the         Directive on Markets in Financial Instruments        (MiFID), including risk transfer to the retail sector.       Second line of defence - independent third parties      The second line of defence is made up, above all, of the auditors, but accounting firms, banks, investment bankers and lawyers, as well as rating agencies and financial analysts, also have an important role to play. At this control level, transactions must be transparent and conflicts of interest reduced to a minimum.     In this connection, the Commission has presented a       proposal for a directive on statutory audit of annual accounts and consolidated accounts      (       COM(2004) 177      final). The proposal provides for:      full group auditor responsibility for consolidated accounts;       the establishment of audit committees in public-interest entities;       auditor rotation;       strengthening of sanction regimes.      In the area of customs cooperation, the EU acquired two important legislative instruments in 2005:      a         Regulation to prevent money laundering        that requires cash control based on a declaration system for amounts exceeding EUR 15 000;       an anti-money laundering Directive covering trust and company service providers.      The Commission will look more closely at financial analysts and credit rating agencies as regards:      access to inside information from insurers;       the way they carry out their credit assessment;       entry barriers in the industry;       conflicts of interest.       Third line of defence - supervision      Member States play a key role in enforcing EU legislation regarding supervision and public scrutiny.     In October 2005 the EU Council reached a political agreement on the       proposal for a directive on statutory audit (COM(2004) 177 final)      that requires adequately funded, effective and independent public supervision for all statutory auditors and audit firms.     More than one authority is involved in supervising the institutions operating on financial markets. In the Commission's view, it is important to develop deeper cooperation between sectors:      in the Member States, between the different authorities with the task of supervising institutions operating on their financial markets, and in particular in the securities, banking and insurance sectors;       at European level, between the European supervisory authorities. A framework for voluntary cooperation exists here between the members of the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR), the European Banking Committee (EBC), the European Insurance and Pension Committee (EIOPS), the Committee of Insurance and Occupational Pension Supervisors (CEIPS) and the Committee of Banking Supervisors (CEBS).      The Commission envisages a clear division of labour between the national level and the European level of supervision, and one that favours the latter in the event of cross-border transactions. As part of more wide-ranging cooperation between these two levels, the Commission would like to see improved transparency of tax systems by facilitating access to, and the exchange of, information. The possibility of using a single direct tax identification number for companies will be looked into.     In order to improve administrative cooperation, the Communication sets out the following practical measures:      in the short term, better use of existing EU instruments and the exchange of best practices between Member States;       in the medium term, broadening of the scope for joint investigations in direct tax matters both between Member States and, at national level, between the different services involved;       in the longer term, possible extension of the automatic exchange of information could be extended to other areas of direct taxation or other types of income by using new technologies.      The Commission and the Member States are developing concrete proposals targeted at cases of tax fraud and avoidance involving complex and opaque structures.     Outside the EU, far greater transparency and exchange of information with third countries as well as with dependent or associated territories should be promoted. For this, better consistency is essential in defining EU policies towards cooperative and non-cooperative tax havens.     The Communication states that:      the EU partners should improve transparency and the exchange of tax information;       the EU should provide reinforced technical assistance or economic support for a limited period of time;       bilateral agreements on the exchange of information on tax havens should be reached between the EU and the individual member countries of the         Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development        (OECD).       Fourth line of defence - law enforcement      This line of defence is concerned mainly with police forces and the judicial authorities responsible for investigations and prosecutions that may have both a preventive and a repressive effect. The Commission has attempted to provide the Member States with more effective legal instruments to combat financial crime. These are:      the         Millennium Strategy        published in 2000 by the Commission;       the         Framework Decision on combating fraud and counterfeiting        of non-cash means of payment adopted by the Council in 2001;       the         Framework Decision on money laundering        , the identification, tracing, freezing, seizing and confiscation of instrumentalities and the proceeds of crime adopted in 2001;       the 2000 Council Decision concerning arrangements for cooperation between financial intelligence units (FIUs) of the Member States;       the         2003 Communication on a comprehensive EU anti corruption policy        .      At EU level, the Commission has identified a number of improvements that need to be made:      the exchange of information and cooperation between national authorities,         Europol        and         Eurojust        regarding investigations and prosecutions. In 2004 Eurpol and Eurojust signed a cooperation agreement (         PDF        )       cooperation between regulatory bodies and law enforcement services;       the exchange of information on bank accounts and other bank-related information already provided for in the         Protocol to the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters        between the Member States of the European Union;       cooperation between the financial and other business sectors and law-enforcement authorities as part of a close partnership between the public and the private sector;       financial investigation, which must be accompanied by severe penalties for the wilful destruction of documents;       the traceability of financial flows, which could be introduced for the recording of electronic payments. The " Cyber Tools OnLine Search for Evidence " project (CTOSE) (could enable the gathering of electronic evidence;       the effects of certain disqualifications should be enforced throughout the EU and not simply in the country ordering the disqualification.      The Commission would like to see Member States establish specialised national bodies that could cooperate at European level with a view to effective identification, freezing, seizing and confiscation of laundered proceeds.      Context      The Communication fits into the general framework laid down by the       Financial Services Action Programme      (FSAP) and the Action Plan modernising company law and enhancing corporate governance (       COM(2003) 284      ), which lay down the political foundations at Community level. The Communication stresses that these action plans should not be changed but, instead, should be implemented in a timely manner and by ensuring effective control of the application of legislation.

summary of   Framework Decision 2003/577/JHA — executing freezing orders abroad   summary    what does this framework decision do   It establishes rules for the recognition and execution by an EU country of a freezing order issued by the judicial authority of another EU country in a criminal proceeding. It also covers the freezing of evidence.   It works alongside Framework Decision  2006/783/JHA  on the mutual recognition of confiscation orders in depriving criminals of their assets even when they are held in another EU country.   From May 2017, the rules of this Framework Decision which deal with the freezing of evidence will be replaced by  Directive 2014/41  regarding the European Investigation Order in criminal matters.   key points    What is a freezing order?   It is a  temporary  order from a judicial authority to prevent criminals  hiding, selling on or using  property, documents or data in criminal activity.  This decision applies to freezing orders issued for the purpose of:    securing elements  which could be used as  evidence  in a criminal proceeding, or   subsequent  confiscation orders  to permanently stop offenders from benefiting from their criminal conduct and prevent criminal property from being laundered or reinvested, potentially fuelling further criminality.    Offences   A number of  serious offences  do not require a check for double criminality - i.e. that the offence be a crime in both the EU country issuing the order (issuing country) and the one executing it (executing country). The offence must, however, be punishable in the issuing country by a jail sentence of a maximum period of at least three years. The offences include:   participation in a criminal organisation   terrorism   corruption and fraud   trafficking in human beings   racism   rape.    Recognition and execution   The judicial authority of the issuing country sends a  certificate  to the judicial authority of the executing country to request execution of the order. The executing country must:   recognise the order without further formality and take the necessary measures for its immediate execution;   observe the formalities and procedures set out by the issuing state in executing the freezing order, unless they are contrary to the fundamental principles of law in the executing state.    Non-recognition or non-execution   The executing state may refuse to recognise or execute the order if:   the certificate is not produced, is incomplete or manifestly does not correspond to the freezing order;   there is an immunity or privilege under the law of the executing state that makes it impossible to execute the freezing order;   it is instantly clear from the information provided in the certificate that any judicial assistance would infringe the legal principle that new proceedings cannot be brought if a final judgment has already been given for the same facts;   the act on which the freezing order is based is not an offence under the law of the executing state unless:   it is listed amongst the serious offences for which execution is automatic   it relates to taxes or duties, customs and exchange.      Postponing execution   Execution of the order may be postponed where:   it might damage an ongoing criminal investigation;   the property or evidence concerned have already been subjected to a freezing order in criminal proceedings;   the property is already subject to an order in another proceeding in the executing state. However, such an order must have priority over any future national freezing orders in criminal proceedings under national law.    Interested parties   EU countries must ensure that any interested party affected by the freezing order, including legitimate third parties, has access to legal remedies to protect their legitimate interests, without requiring the order to be suspended.   from when does the decision apply  It entered into force on 2 August 2003. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 2 August 2005.   background    Confiscation and freezing of assets   act   Council Framework Decision  2003/577/JHA  of 22 July 2003 on the execution in the European Union of orders freezing property or evidence (OJ L 196, 2.8.2003, pp. 45–55)   Corrigendum  to Council Framework Decision 2003/577/JHA of 22 July 2003 on the execution in the European Union of orders freezing property or evidence (OJ L 196, 2.8.2003) (OJ L 374, 27.12.2006, p. 20)
   Patent law in the field of biotechnology and genetic engineering: implementation report (2005)     Patent law in the field of biotechnology and genetic engineering: implementation report (2005)     This second report focuses on issues relating to the patenting of sequences of genes which have been isolated from the human body and the patentability of inventions concerning stem cells. It also reports on the implementation of the Directive on the       legal protection of biotechnological inventions      .     ACT     Report from the Commission of 14 July 2005 - Development and implications of patent law in the field of biotechnology and genetic engineering [       COM(2005) 312      - Official Journal C 211 of 30.8.2005].     SUMMARY     The Commission drew up this report on the basis of the work carried out by the group of experts set up following the first report.     It presents an analysis of the two issues which had been raised in 2002:       the patenting of sequences of genes which have been isolated from the human body       The aim was to determine the scope of the protection conferred by patents to this type of product: classical protection covering possible future uses of the sequence or protection restricted only to the specific use disclosed in the patent application ("purpose-bound protection").     The Commission has not taken a position so far regarding the scope of Member States' protection. It will, nonetheless, monitor the matter closely to determine whether there are any economic consequences of possible divergences between Member States' legislation.       the patentability of human embryonic stem cells and cell lines obtained from them       A distinction should be drawn between totipotent stem cells, which are capable of developing into a human being, and pluripotent embryonic stem cells, which do not have this capability.     The former are clearly excluded from patenting on grounds of human dignity.     For the latter, the group of experts considered that the question of patenting was linked to the definition of what constitutes an embryo, and the scope of research allowed, which is determined by national legislation. Given the divergences which exist between Member States on this matter, the Commission considers that it is premature to give further definition or provide for further harmonisation in this area.     The Commission will monitor developments in this field and has launched a study looking at the ethical and legal aspects of stem cell patenting.     It draws attention to the initiation of legal proceedings in 2003 for failure to transmit transposition measures and the opening of new procedures in December 2004 against Latvia and Lithuania which had not completed the transposition of the Directive. Italy and Luxembourg had also still not applied the Directive in July 2005.     RELATED ACTS      Report from the Commission of 7 October 2002 - Development and implications of patent law in the field of biotechnology and genetic engineering         COM(2002) 545        final [Not published in the Official Journal]      This document is the Commission's       first annual report      aimed at evaluating the implementation of Directive       98/44/EC      on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions. It examines the development of patent law in the field of biotechnology and genetic engineering, and identifies and evaluates problems and sensitive issues which have recently arisen.      European Parliament and Council Directive         98/44/EC        of 6 July 1998 on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions [Official Journal L 213 of 30.07.1998]      The purpose of this       Directive      is to guarantee clear and effective legal protection in the field of biotechnology. It also specifically bans human cloning and any modifications to germ line genetic identity. The ethical aspects are handled by an independent committee which has been given the task of advising the European Commission on these matters.     Last updated: 03.01.2006  
   i2010 Intelligent Car Initiative (third eSafety communication)     i2010 Intelligent Car Initiative (third eSafety communication)     The European Commission’s Intelligent Car Initiative is designed to promote the use of new technologies to make cars safer, cleaner and more efficient. The Initiative aims to provide an answer to social problems related to road transport, primarily accidents and traffic congestion.     ACT     Commission communication of 15 February 2006 on the Intelligent Car Initiative – "Raising Awareness of ICT for Smarter, Safer and Cleaner Vehicles” [       COM(2006) 59      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The increased use of road transport brings with it a number of worrying problems: congestion of road networks and urban areas, harmful effects on the environment and public health, waste of energy and, above all, injuries, material damage and fatal accidents. The Intelligent Car Initiative is intended to help resolve these road traffic problems.      POTENTIAL OF INTELLIGENT CARS      The use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in building intelligent cars can contribute towards:      increasing road safety;       making transport systems more efficient;       using fuel more efficiently;       helping drivers to prevent or avoid accidents;       providing drivers with real-time information about the road network in order to avoid congestion;       enabling drivers to optimise journeys.      More specifically, studies have shown that the use of ICT could enable the number of accidents in the European Union (EU) to be reduced considerably. For example, 1 500 accidents a year could be avoided if 0.6 % of vehicles were equipped with systems helping them to stay in lane or to overtake.      JUSTIFICATION FOR EUROPEAN ACTION      Despite their potential, most intelligent systems are not yet on the market. The vehicles equipped with new-generation systems are mainly top-of-the-range cars representing only a small percentage of the market.     The large-scale deployment of active safety systems (ABS, adaptive cruise control, etc.), has sometimes faced numerous obstacles, including legal barriers, the high cost of intelligent systems and the lack of public information. Moreover, the extremely competitive situation in the automotive sector creates conditions which are unfavourable to the development of these systems.     A comprehensive approach at EU level will enable harmonised solutions to be found. This will involve removing obstacles to market deployment, stimulating product demand and building consensus among key players. Moreover, pollution, road safety and congestion are problems common to all the Member States. Action at European level is therefore all the more appropriate.      OBJECTIVES OF THE INITIATIVE       Coordination of effort      The first objective of the initiative is to support and coordinate the work of relevant stakeholders, citizens, Member States and the industry in order to speed up the development and application of intelligent systems.     In this context, the       eSafety Forum      has a vital role to play. Set up in 2003, the Forum aims to remove the obstacles preventing intelligent vehicle systems from entering the market.     In addition to the Forum’s work, the initiatives which will be taken in support of this first objective also include:      following up and reporting on the actions proposed in the second eSafety communication "         Bringing eCall to Citizens        ". The follow-up will relate mainly to the signature of the memorandum of understanding on the         eCall system        by Member States, implementation of the single emergency numbers 112 and E112, and upgrading the PSAPs (Public Service Answering Points);       presenting a Commission         recommendation        on the design and safe use of Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI);       investigating the possibility of using         incentive schemes at national level        to stimulate the purchase of vehicles equipped with safety functions;       examining         spectrum        needs in the context of vehicle-to-vehicle communication and assessing the implications of the Intelligent Car Initiative for spectrum use;       following up the recommendation on the establishment of a         European Code of Practice        for the development and testing of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems.       Supporting research and development (R&D) work      The long-term objectives of the Intelligent Car Initiative form part of the information and communication technologies priority of the       7th R&D Framework Programme      .     To support research and development in the sphere of smarter, cleaner and safer vehicles, the Commission proposes the following action:      targeting research at the needs of the         next generation of driver assistance systems        , (in particular enhanced performance, reliability, security and reduced fuel consumption) and undertaking additional research work on         traffic and traveller information services        ;       implementing, through the 7th R&D Framework Programme, an         assessment programme        based on field operational tests to assess in real environments the impact of intelligent systems on driver behaviour and driving dynamics;       setting up an         independent conformance testing and performance assessment programme        for road safety and efficiency systems based on ICT.       Awareness      The third objective of the Intelligent Car Initiative is to promote the dissemination of information to a wide audience in order to make drivers and policymakers aware of the potential of intelligent vehicle systems. This greater awareness will help to stimulate user demand and to promote socio-economic acceptance.     Within this awareness component, the Commission proposes the following action:      holding regular         i2010 Intelligent Car Initiative events        ;       producing         television series or documentaries        on ICT-based systems and launching a comprehensive benchmarking study on ongoing activities in promoting intelligent vehicle systems in the Member States and in the industry;       establishing an         eSafety Communication Platform        with the aim of improving, coordinating and harmonising the end-user communication of the various stakeholders;       supporting and promoting         stakeholders’ initiatives        which pursue the objectives of the Intelligent Car Initiative.       Background      The Intelligent Car Initiative is part of the EU's       i2010 strategy      aimed at generally stimulating the development of the digital economy in Europe. It also continues to build on the foundations laid in the 2004 White Paper on       transport policy challenges between now and 2010      , which seeks, among other things, to reduce by half the number of road fatalities by 2010.     RELATED ACTS      Communication of 17 September 2007 from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: “Towards Europe-wide Safer, Cleaner and Efficient Mobility: The First Intelligent Car Report” [         COM(2007) 541        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      Considerable progress has already been achieved with the Intelligent Car Initiative. In view of the potential benefits that intelligent vehicle systems offer for road safety and the environment, the European Commission proposes new measures to introduce safer, cleaner and smarter vehicles to the market more quickly. It focuses, for instance, on the full-scale roll-out of the “eCall" system, and envisages the adoption, if necessary, of regulatory measures on the availability of electronic stability control (ESC) systems and systems for accident avoidance (ADAS). Provided they comply with Community legislation on taxes and State aid, incentives might also help towards the deployment of intelligent vehicle systems. The Commission also points to the importance of raising consumer awareness in order to create demand for smart vehicles.      Commission communication of 14 September 2005: “2nd eSafety communication – “Bringing eCall to citizens” [         COM(2005) 431        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      This communication on the roll-out of the       eCall system      is the second eSafety communication. eCall is a pan-European in-vehicle emergency call system which uses the European emergency number 112 in the event of an accident.     In this communication, the Commission calls on national and regional authorities to carry out the actions and investments necessary for the functioning of eCall. The document also presents the roadmap agreed between the stakeholders to ensure the complete roll-out of the system in 2009.      Commission communication of 15 September 2003: “Information and Communications Technologies for Safe and Intelligent Vehicles” [         COM(2003) 542        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      In this       first eSafety communication      , the Commission proposes the systematic use of ICT to design safer and smarter vehicles. For this, it proposes three categories of action: promoting intelligent vehicle safety systems, adapting the regulatory and standardisation provisions, and removing the societal and business obstacles.      Commission communication of 2 June 2003: “European Road Safety Action Programme – Halving the number of road accident victims in the European Union by 2010: A shared responsibility” [         COM(2003) 311        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      The ultimate objective of the       Road Safety Action Programme (2003-2010)      is to reduce by at least 50 % the number of people killed on the roads by 2010. For this, the programme proposes a range of measures such as stepping up road checks, deploying new road safety technologies, improving road infrastructure, and measures to improve the behaviour of road users.      Commission White Paper of 12 September 2001: “European transport policy for 2010: time to decide” [         COM(2001) 370        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      This       White Paper      seeks to develop a modern and sustainable transport system for 2010.

summary of   Regulation (EU) No 1092/2010 on macro-prudential oversight of the financial system and the establishment of a European Systemic Risk Board   what is the aim of the regulation  In the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, the  European Union  introduced legislation on macro-prudential oversight of the financial system and establishing the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB).  The ESRB is responsible for the macro-prudential oversight of the EU’s financial system and contributes to the prevention or mitigation of systemic risks in the EU as a whole or parts thereof. It identifies and discusses financial stability risks regardless of their origin.  It establishes the  European Systemic Risk Board  (ESRB) as part of the new  European System of Financial Supervision  (ESFS), which also includes:   the  European Banking Authority  ;   the  European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority  ;   the  European Securities and Markets Authority  ;   the  Joint Committee of European Supervisory Authorities  ;   the supervisory authorities in the EU countries.   The new supervisory architecture also includes a  regulation  that gives the  European Central Bank  (ECB) certain specific tasks to support the ESRB.   key points    Mandate, objectives and tasks   The ESRB is based in Frankfurt am Main (Germany). It is responsible for monitoring and analysing risk in the financial system as a whole (also known as macro-prudential oversight). To achieve this, the ESRB in particular:   identifies systemic risks and classifies them according to their priority;   issues warnings where systemic risks are deemed to be significant and makes them public if necessary;   recommends remedial action in response to risks identified;   can transmit a confidential warning and assessment to the Council when it considers that an emergency situation is likely to occur;   monitors the measures taken in response to warnings and recommendations;   coordinates with international financial organisations like the  International Monetary Fund  and the  Financial Stability Board  (FSB).    Organisation   The ESRB has the following structure:   a  General Board  that ensures the performance of tasks by taking the necessary decisions;   a  Steering Committee  which assists in the decision-making process;   a  Secretariat  responsible for day-to-day business and providing support;   an  Advisory Scientific Committee  and an  Advisory Technical Committee  to provide advice and assistance.   The ESRB has a chair who represents the ESRB externally and two vice-chairs. The ECB provides analytical, statistical, logistical and administrative support to the ESRB by running the ESRB’s Secretariat.   Warnings and recommendations   In the event of significant systemic risks to its objective, the ESRB provides warnings and, where appropriate, issues recommendations for remedial action, including legislative initiatives. These warnings or recommendations are addressed in particular to:   the EU as a whole;   1 or more EU countries;   ECB for the banking macro-prudential supervision tasks conferred to it;   1 or more  European supervisory authorities (ESAs)  ;   1 or more national supervisory authorities;   1 or more national authorities designated for the application of measures aimed at addressing systemic or macro-prudential risk;   the  European Commission  in respect of relevant EU legislation;   resolution authorities designated by EU countries; or   the Single Resolution Board.    ESRB recommendations   Addressees of recommendations must comply or provide an explanation for any inaction. If the ESRB decides that its recommendation has not been followed or that addressees have not provided adequate justification for their inaction, it confidentially informs the addressees, the  European Parliament  , the  Council  and the relevant ESAs.   The further evolution of the European surveillance system   As the financial crisis evolved and following the worsening sovereign debt crisis in the euro area in 2010-2011, the further integration of the euro area banking systems became necessary. This is why, based on the Commission’s  roadmap  for setting up a  banking union  , the European institutions created the following.    A Single Supervisory Mechanism  (SSM), placing the ECB as the central supervisor for euro area banks (around 6,000 banks). Non-euro area countries may also decide to join.   A  Single Resolution Mechanism  (SRM), the objective of which is to ensure the orderly resolution of failing banks covered by the SSM without using taxpayers’ money.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 16 December 2010.   background   For more information, see:    Banking and finance  (  European Commission  )    Financial supervision  (  European Commission  )    Establishment of the ESRB  (  European Systemic Risk Board  ).
   Preventing HIV/AIDS (Council conclusions of 2005)     Preventing HIV/AIDS (Council conclusions of 2005)     The HIV/AIDS epidemic and the related underlying phenomena fuelling the spread of the epidemic are common. The Council therefore adopted a series of conclusions encouraging the Member States and the Commission to step up their efforts to tackle the epidemic.     ACT     Conclusions of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council of 3 June 2005 on combating HIV/AIDS [Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY      Current situation      The HIV/AIDS       *      epidemic and the related underlying phenomena fuelling the spread of the epidemic continue to be a major threat to public health. AIDS causes human suffering and disability, increases the risk of social exclusion, and has negative implications for national economies.     As well as continuing to strengthen existing methods to prevent the disease, it is still necessary to further develop research, surveillance, and methods for effective intervention.     The HIV/AIDS epidemic is fuelled to a great extent by social factors, such as inequality between women and men, poverty and social marginalisation of the most vulnerable populations.     Effective prevention of the epidemic requires increased cooperation between the Commission, Member States, accession, candidate and neighbouring countries, and international organisations such as       UNAIDS       *      , with the participation of people living with HIV/AIDS and the civil society concerned.      European framework for AIDS prevention      The Council's conclusions are based on a series of measures and conferences related directly or indirectly to AIDS prevention, in particular:      the Council Recommendation of 18 June 2003 on the         prevention and reduction of harm associated with drug dependence        ;       the declaration adopted following the Conference "Breaking the Barriers - Partnership to fight HIV/AIDS in Europe and Central Asia" (Dublin, 23/24 February 2004), which called for the European Union's capacity to fight the spread of HIV/AIDS to be strengthened;       the "Vilnius Declaration" adopted following the Ministerial Conference "Europe and HIV/AIDS - New Challenges, New Opportunities" (Vilnius, Lithuania, 17 September 2004), highlighting the need for joint efforts to strengthen comprehensive prevention activities and build effective partnerships between governments, civil society and the private sector;       the Commission working paper of 8 September 2004 "Coordinated and integrated approach to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic within the European Union and in its neighbourhood";       the Communication from the Commission,         COM(2004) 0726        final, of 26 October 2004 on a coherent European policy framework for external action to confront HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.       Action at national level      In light of the above, the Council encourages Member States to adopt measures to:      implement the Dublin Declaration and the Vilnius Declaration;       implement national multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS coordination structures, strategies and financing plans;       raise public awareness of prevention of HIV infection and provide better information on sexual and reproductive health         *        ;       take further action to promote safer and more responsible sexual behaviour and practices, including condom use, and scale up access for injecting drug users to prevention, drug dependence treatment and harm reduction services;       counsel and support people with the virus, their families and their friends, and maintain a respectful, non-discriminatory and accepting societal atmosphere and behaviour towards people with HIV/AIDS;       develop a sustainable, affordable, and accessible health care system as a basis for prevention, treatment, and care activities, and ensure that all those in need have access to affordable anti-retroviral         *        treatment;       improve cooperation between clinical trials in the continuing search for HIV-vaccines and microbicides;       continue to work closely together with the European Commission and other relevant international organisations and agencies when planning and agreeing specific bilateral actions in the context of         neighbourhood        and development policy.       Action at Commission level      The Council calls upon the Commission to:      support Member States in their efforts to implement the Dublin and Vilnius Declarations;       contribute to efforts to improve general knowledge and to raise public awareness of prevention of HIV infection;       contribute to activities intended to establish a respectful, non-discriminatory and accepting societal atmosphere and behaviour towards people with HIV/AIDS;       facilitate the use of existing EC financing instruments for the implementation of comprehensive national HIV/AIDS strategies within the Member States and in neighbouring countries;       promote investment in the appropriate research and development of effective behavioural and risk-reducing as well as prophylactic measures and cure;       encourage the         European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control        to further reinforce and coordinate activities on the surveillance of communicable diseases, including HIV/AIDS;       facilitate collaboration between the Member States, accession, candidate and neighbouring countries and relevant international organisations in order to promote the exchange of good practices and joint projects;       promote dialogue and cooperation with countries at regional and global levels, as well as with international organisations such as UNAIDS.        Key terms used in the act         HIV: the acronym HIV stands for "human immunodeficiency virus".         AIDS: the acronym AIDS stands for "acquired immunodeficiency syndrome".         UNAIDS: UNAIDS is a partnership between various United Nations bodies, the World Health Organisation and the World Bank. As the main advocate for global action against HIV/AIDS infection, UNAIDS leads, strengthens and supports an expanded response to the epidemic in order to: prevent transmission of HIV; provide care and support; reduce the vulnerability of individuals and communities to HIV/AIDS infection; alleviate the impact of the epidemic. It plays a crucial role in managing and disseminating knowledge and information on the epidemic and on global action.         Reproductive health: reproductive health refers to a series of conditions, events and processes which occur during life, from smooth sexual development, intimate sexual relations and motherhood to abuse, illness, disability and death. It is closely linked to a person's values, culture and vision of the future. Reproductive health thus covers not only family planning but also areas such as sex education, safe pregnancy, control of sexually-transmitted diseases and incorporation of an approach based on gender equality.         Antiretroviral treatment: the objective of antiretroviral treatment is to achieve maximum reduction in viral load for as long a period as possible in order to keep the disease in check. The treatment therefore does not rule out HIV. It involves several different drugs and must be continued throughout life.

   Turkey– Taxation     Turkey– Taxation     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM(2011) 666      final – SEC(2011) 1201 – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The       2011 Report      notes limited progress in terms of legislative alignment. The European Commission observes no advancement on direct taxation matters.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission's words)      The       acquis      on taxation essentially covers the area of       indirect taxation      , which comprises VAT (value-added tax) and excise duties. It lays down scope, definitions and principles for VAT. Excise duties on energy products, tobacco products and alcoholic beverages are regulated by EU legislation. With regard to       direct taxation      , the       acquis      covers some aspects of the taxation of individuals’ savings and corporate taxes. Furthermore, Member States are required to comply with the principles of the code of conduct relating to       corporate taxes      , which seeks to abolish harmful tax measures. Administrative cooperation and mutual assistance between Member States aims at ensuring the smooth running of the internal market in the field of taxation and provides instruments for preventing intra-Community       fraud and tax evasion      . Member States must ensure that they have the necessary implementation capacities, specifically connectivity with the EU’s IT taxation systems.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      On       taxation      , there has been limited progress on legislative alignment, particularly towards eliminating some discriminatory practices in the taxation of tobacco. The increase in excise duty on spirits contradicts the Action plan agreed with the Commission on that issue. Abolition of discriminatory practices in taxation is key to making further progress in this chapter. No progress can be reported on direct taxation.     RELATED ACTS      Commission Report [         COM(2010) 660        final –SEC(2010) 1327 – Not published in the Official Journal].      In the 2010 Report the Commission regretted the limited level of alignment on taxation matters, but also highlighted the improvement in the running of taxation institutions. Particular effort was required to ensure efficient financial controls.      Commission Report [         COM(2009) 533        final – SEC(2009) 1334 – Not published in the Official Journal].       Commission Report [         COM(2008) 674        final – SEC(2008) 2699 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2008 Report indicated that alignment of legislation in this area had not progressed very far. However, the Report highlighted some progress with regard to the modernisation of the tax administration.      Commission Report [         COM(2007) 663        final – SEC(2007) 1436 –Not published in the Official Journal.      In its 2007 Report, the Commission found that new progress had been made, but that full alignment was still not a reality. Discriminatory practices still persisted in certain areas, such as alcoholic products and tobacco. Furthermore, administrative capacity needed strengthening.      Commission Report [         COM(2006) 649        final – SEC(2006) 1390 –Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2006 Report noted that limited progress has been made in the area of taxation. It stated that further efforts would be required to achieve alignment with the       acquis      , especially as regards the scope and rates of VAT, the structure and rates of excise duties, and direct taxation.      Commission Report [         COM(2005) 561        final – SEC(2005) 1426 –Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2005 Report noted that Turkey still needed to take substantial steps to achieve alignment with the       acquis      , particularly as regards the scope and rate of VAT, the structure and rate of excise duties, and direct taxation. Turkish tax legislation still contained discriminatory measures and administrative capacity remained weak.      Commission Report [         COM(2004) 656        final – SEC(2004) 1201 –Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2004 Report noted limited progress in the area of indirect taxation but no progress on direct taxation or administrative cooperation. Overall, the Turkish tax regime remained partly aligned with the       acquis      , and important efforts still needed to be made in all areas under that chapter. Alignment was particularly necessary with regard to VAT, the scope of exempt transactions and applied rates. With regard to taxation, excise duties ought not to penalise imported products. Administrative capacity also needed to be substantially strengthened, in particular to improve tax collection.      Commission Report [         COM(2003) 676        final – SEC(2003) 1212 –Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2003 Report found that Turkey had made limited progress in terms of both legislation and tax administration capacity.      Commission Report [         COM(2002) 700        final – SEC(2002) 1412 –Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2002 Report stated that Turkey had made substantial progress in aligning its tax legislation with the       acquis      in the area of indirect taxation.      Commission Report [         COM(2001) 700        final – SEC(2001) 1756 –Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2001 Report considered that Turkey had moved forward, particularly with regard to excise duties. In fact, the level of duties was higher than the minimum rate applied in the European Community (EC) to all fuels. As regards direct taxation, the tax system applicable to mergers, divisions and transfers of shares as well as the capital gains rules were now in line with the       acquis      . As far as administrative capacity was concerned, the implementation of a personal identification number for tax purposes was aimed at improving the collection of tax.      Commission Report [         COM(2000) 713        final –Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2000 Report noted that very little progress had been made in the area of taxation since the last evaluation.

summary of   Directive 2009/72/EC – rules for the EU’s electricity market   summary    what does the directive do   It seeks to introduce common rules for the generation, transmission, distribution and supply of electricity.   It also lays down universal service obligations and consumer rights, and clarifies competition requirements.   key points    Rules for the organisation of the sector   The rules for the organisation of the sector are aimed at developing a competitive, secure and environmentally sustainable market in electricity.  EU countries may impose on undertakings operating in the electricity sector public service obligations which cover issues of security and security of supply, regularity and quality of service, price, environmental protection and energy efficiency.  EU countries have to ensure that all customers have the right to choose their electricity supplier and to change supplier easily, with the operator’s assistance, within 3 weeks. They also have to ensure that customers receive relevant consumption data.  Electricity suppliers are obliged to inform final customers about:   the contribution of each energy source;   the environmental impact caused;   their rights in the event of a dispute.   EU countries must put in place an independent mechanism (energy ombudsman or consumer body) to manage complaints or disputes efficiently.  EU countries are also obliged to ensure the monitoring of security of supply. They have to define technical safety criteria to ensure the integration of their national markets at one or more regional levels. In addition, the national regulatory authorities are to cooperate with the  Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators  to guarantee the compatibility of regulatory frameworks between regions.   Generation   EU countries must define criteria for the construction of generating capacity in their territory taking account of aspects such as:   the security and safety of electricity networks;   the protection of health and public safety;   the contribution made towards the Commission's ‘  20-20-20  ’ objectives.    Transmission system operation   From 3 March 2012, EU countries had to unbundle transmission systems and transmission system operators.  An undertaking must first be certified before being officially designated as a transmission system operator. A list of transmission system operators designated by EU countries has to be published in the  Official Journal of the European Union  .  Transmission system operators are mainly responsible for:   ensuring the long-term ability of the system to meet demands for electricity;   ensuring adequate means to meet service obligations;   contributing to security of supply;   managing electricity flows on the system;   providing to the operator of any other system information related to the operation, development and interoperability of the interconnected system;   ensuring non-discrimination between system users;   providing system users with the information they need to access the system;   collecting congestion rents and payments under the inter-transmission system operator compensation mechanism.    Distribution network operation   EU countries must designate distribution system operators or require undertakings that own or are responsible for distribution systems to do so.  Distribution system operators are mainly responsible for:   ensuring long-term capacity of the system in terms of the distribution of electricity, operation, maintenance, development and environmental protection;   ensuring transparency with respect to system users;   providing system users with information;   covering energy losses and maintaining reserve electricity capacity.   EU countries have the option of putting in place a closed distribution system to distribute electricity within a geographically confined industrial, commercial or shared services site.   Unbundling and transparency of accounts   EU countries and the competent authorities have right of access to the accounts of electricity undertakings but shall preserve the confidentiality of certain information.  Electricity undertakings have to keep separate accounts for their transmission and distribution activities.   Organisation of access to the system   EU countries must organise a system of third party access to transmission and distribution systems. The tariffs based on that system shall be published.  EU countries must also lay down criteria for the granting of authorisations to construct direct lines in their territory, on an objective and non-discriminatory basis.   National regulatory authorities   EU countries must designate a regulatory authority at national level. It shall be independent and exercise its powers impartially. It is mainly responsible for:   fixing transmission or distribution tariffs;   cooperating in regard to cross-border issues;   monitoring investment plans of the transmission system operators;   ensuring access to customer consumption data.    Retail markets   Contractual arrangements, commitment to customers, data exchange and settlement rules, data ownership and metering responsibility must be defined.  Non-household customers may contract simultaneously with several suppliers.   Derogatory measures   An EU country may take the necessary safeguard measures in the event of a sudden crisis in the market or where the safety of persons is threatened. Derogations may also be obtained in the event of operating problems in isolated systems.  Directive 2009/72/EC repealed  Directive 2003/54/EC  with effect from 3 March 2011.   Smart metering - progress to date   In 2012, the  European Commission  adopted  Recommendation 2012/148/EU  . This set out detailed recommendations regarding:   data protection and security,   the methodology for the economic assessment of the long-term costs and benefits for the roll-out of smart metering systems, as well as   common minimum functional requirements for smart metering systems for electricity.   In accordance with Directive 2009/72/EC, EU countries reported to the Commission in 2012 on the results of their cost-benefit analyses regarding the roll-out of smart metering systems. The results of this benchmarking exercise were published in a Commission  report  in 2014.   from when does the directive apply  It applies from 3 September 2009. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 3 March 2011.   background   For more information, see  Market legislation  on the European Commission's website   act   Directive  2009/72/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and repealing Directive 2003/54/EC (OJ L 211, 14.8.2009, pp. 55–93)
summary of   Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)   what is the aim of article 288 of the tfeu  The  Lisbon Treaty  revised the classification of EU legal acts. In the interests of simplification, it reduced from more than 10 to 5 the number of  legal acts  at the EU institutions’ disposal.  In addition, it enabled the  European Commission  to adopt a new category of acts: delegated acts. It also strengthened the Commission’s competence to adopt implementing acts. Both these changes sought to improve the effectiveness of EU decision-making and of the implementation of these decisions.   key points    EU legal acts and their classification   Under Article 288 of the TFEU, the European institutions may adopt 5 types of legal acts:   the  regulation  ;   the  directive  ;   the  decision  ;   the  recommendation  ;   the  opinion  .   Regulations, directives and decisions are binding legal acts, while the recommendation and the opinion are not.  A decision can specifically address one or more addressees (EU countries, businesses or individuals). There are also decisions with no specific addressee, particularly in the area of the  Common Foreign and Security Policy  (CFSP).   Delegated acts    Article 290  of the TFEU allows the EU legislator (generally, the  European Parliament  and the  Council  ) to delegate to the Commission the power to adopt non-legislative acts of general application that supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act.  For example,  delegated acts  may add new (non-essential) rules or involve a subsequent amendment to certain aspects of a legislative act. The legislator can thus concentrate on policy direction and objectives without entering into overly detailed and often highly technical debates.  The delegation of power to adopt delegated acts is nevertheless subject to strict limits. Indeed, only the Commission can be empowered to adopt delegated acts. Furthermore, the essential elements of an area may not be subject to a delegation of power. In addition, the objectives, content, scope and duration of the delegation of power must be defined in the legislative acts. Lastly, the legislator must explicitly set in the legislative act the conditions under which this delegation may be exercised. In this respect, the Parliament and the Council may provide for the right to revoke the delegation or to express objections to the delegated act.  This procedure is widely used in many areas, for example: internal market, agriculture, environment, consumer protection, transport, and the area of freedom, security and justice.   Implementing acts   Responsibility for implementing legally binding EU acts lies primarily with EU countries. However, some legally binding EU acts require uniform conditions for the implementation. In these cases, the Commission or, in duly justified specific cases and in cases provided in the Articles  24  and  26  of the Treaty on European Union, the Council is empowered to adopt  implementing acts  (  Article 291  of the TFEU).  Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and the Council lays down the rules and general principles concerning  mechanisms for control by EU countries of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers  . This control is performed by means of what is known in EU jargon as  comitology  procedures, i.e. the Commission is assisted by committees consisting of EU countries’ representatives and chaired by a representative of the Commission. Any draft implementing act is submitted to the committee by its chair.   background   For more information, see:    EU law  (  Europa  ).
act    562/2006  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code) (  see amending acts  ).   summary   This regulation applies to any person crossing the external borders of all EU countries, except those of the United Kingdom and Ireland, and the internal borders of the  Schengen area  (a border-free area comprising 22 EU countries, along with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland).   External borders   External borders may be crossed only at  border crossing points  and during the fixed opening hours.  When crossing an external border, EU citizens and other persons enjoying the right of free movement under Union law (such as the family members of an EU citizen) undergo a  minimum check  . This minimum check is carried out to establish their identity on the basis of their travel documents and consists of a rapid and straightforward verification of the validity of the documents (including, where appropriate, the consultation of databases on stolen, misappropriate, lost and invalidated documents) and a check for signs of falsification or counterfeiting.  Non-EU-country nationals are subject to  thorough checks  . These comprise a verification of the entry conditions as described below, including verification in the  visa information system  (VIS), where applicable.  For  stays not exceeding 90 days in any 180-day period  , a non EU-country national must:   possess a valid travel document;   possess a valid visa, if required;   justify the purpose of his/her intended stay and have sufficient means of subsistence;   not have an alert issued for him/her in the  Schengen information system  (SIS) for the purpose of refusing entry;   not be considered a threat to public policy, internal security, public health or the international relations of EU countries.   If these conditions are not met, entry to the territory is refused, unless special provisions (e.g. for humanitarian reasons) apply. Entry may only be refused by a substantiated decision stating the precise reasons for the refusal delivered by a competent national authority by means of a standard form. The person refused entry shall have the right to appeal and must receive written information on the national procedure.  The  travel documents  of non-EU nationals are systematically  stamped upon entry and exit  . If a travel document does not bear an entry stamp, it may be presumed that the holder does not fulfil, or no longer fulfils, the conditions of duration of a short stay. However, the non-EU-country national may provide any credible evidence of having respected the conditions relating to the duration of a short stay, such as transport tickets or proof of his/her presence outside the territory of the EU countries. On the request of a non-EU-country national, the insertion of an entry or exit stamp may be dispensed with if this insertion is liable to cause difficulties for the person. Instead, the stamp must be recorded on a  separate sheet  indicating the person’s name and passport number.  Border checks are carried out by border guards . When performing their duties, border guards must fully respect human dignity and may not discriminate against persons on grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.  The Schengen Borders Code allows EU countries to establish shared border crossing points with their non-EU neighbours, at which border guards from each country carry out exit and entry checks one after the other in accordance with their national law, either on the territory of the EU country concerned or on the territory of a non-EU country.  EU countries must deploy appropriate staff and resources in sufficient numbers to ensure a high and uniform level of control at their external borders. They must ensure that border guards are specialised and properly trained professionals.  EU countries assist each other with the effective application of border controls. Operational cooperation is coordinated by the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (  Frontex  ).   Internal borders   Any person, irrespective of his/her nationality, may cross the internal borders at any point  without checks  being carried out. This does not preclude the possibility for the the national police authorities to exercise their powers, including in the internal border zones, provided that this exercise does not have an effect equivalent to border checks.  EU countries that are part of the  Schengen area  must remove all obstacles to fluid traffic flow at road crossing points at internal borders, in particular any speed limits not exclusively based on road-safety considerations.  Where there is a serious threat to public policy or internal security, these countries may exceptionally  reintroduce border controls  at its internal borders for a period of no more than 30 days (possible to prolong under conditions established by the code) or for the foreseeable duration of the serious threat. This action should be seen as a last resort. If such controls are to be reintroduced, the other EU countries that are part of the Schengen area and the European Commission must be notified without delay with a view to possible consultations. The European Parliament and the Council must be informed at the same time.  Consultations may take place between EU countries and the Commission at least 10 days before the planned reintroduction of border controls, in order to organise mutual cooperation and to examine the proportionality of the measures to the events giving rise to the reintroduction. The decision to reintroduce border controls at internal borders must be taken in a transparent manner and the public must be informed in full, unless there are overriding security reasons for not doing so.  Under exceptional circumstances, and where a serious threat to public policy or internal security in an EU country requires immediate action, the latter may reintroduce border controls at its internal borders immediately. The other EU countries and the Commission are then notified accordingly.  Where, in the framework of the Schengen evaluation, serious deficiencies are identified in the carrying out of external border controls by an EU country, the Commission may issue recommendations. For the EU country concerned, this may include submitting to Frontex strategic plans based on a risk assessment to deal with the situation or initiating the deployment of  European border guard teams  or, as a last resort, triggering the closure of a specific border crossing point.

   “Crime does not pay”     “Crime does not pay”     The confiscation and recovery of proceeds of crime are a powerful means for fighting organised crime effectively. With this communication, the Commission is affirming its commitment to support the development of confiscation-related legislative and non-legislative measures.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council of 20 November 2008 – Proceeds of organised crime: ensuring that “crime does not pay” [       COM(2008) 766      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The confiscation and recovery of criminal assets, as well as international cooperation in this field, are essential to fight organised crime in the European Union (EU). However, the results achieved in this area are modest if compared to the estimated revenues of organised crime, and the legal procedures in Member States have not yet been fully harmonised.     The existing EU legal framework consists of Framework Decisions:       2001/500/JHA        on money laundering, the identification, tracing, freezing, seizing and confiscation of instrumentalities and the proceeds of crime;        2003/577/JHA        on the         execution of orders freezing property or evidence        ;        2005/212/JHA        on confiscation of crime-related proceeds, instrumentalities and property;        2006/783/JHA        on the         mutual recognition of confiscation orders        .      These aim to ensure that a common approach prevails for confiscating and recovering the proceeds of crime. Nevertheless, implementation at national level remains incomplete with regard to Framework Decisions 2003/577/JHA and 2005/212/JHA. It is still too early to assess the implementation of Framework Decision 2006/783/JHA. The flawed implementation may be the result of a lack of clarity and coherence in the texts. Consequently, the Commission proposes that the existing EU legal framework be recast.     At the same time, the Commission proposes to proceed with discussions on the basis of Member States’ experience, in order to extend certain legal concepts and introduce new rules for confiscation. The focus would be on:      non-conviction based (civil) confiscation, which could be allowed when assets are suspected to be proceeds of crime and the suspect is not available to be prosecuted (dead or a fugitive);       “unjustified” assets, owning of which should be made a criminal offence when they are not proportionate to the income declared by a person who has regular contacts with known criminals;       ensuring mutual recognition of freezing and confiscation orders in the EU, irrespective of their nature (criminal or civil);       extending the scope of mandatory confiscation to cases where a conviction was issued for certain serious criminal offences;       the obligatory provision of information on the bank accounts and banking operations of identified persons, thereby putting into effect the provisions of the 2001 Protocol to the         EU Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters        , which remains to be ratified by a number of countries.      Cooperation between Member States needs to be further improved, in order to enable national authorities to exchange information more swiftly and thus enhance the identification of criminal assets. To this end, the Commission is encouraging Member States to proceed with the transposition of Council Decision       2007/845/JHA      , whereby national       Asset Recovery Offices      (AROs) are to be established. For the moment, not all Member States have designated such offices, where they have, the structures, powers and practices vary greatly. The Commission recommends that AROs are established as national contact points for all confiscation-related activities with:      a multidisciplinary structure and expertise from a variety of related fields;       a standardised secure channel of communication for easier and faster exchanges of information;       the necessary powers to identify, trace and provisionally freeze assets;        Europol        coordinating their operational activities to ensure the rapid exchange of information;        Eurojust        facilitating their cooperation with judicial authorities as well as the mutual recognition of freezing and confiscation orders.      It is also essential to enhance cooperation with third countries on confiscation issues. Consequently, the Commission will continue to promote the ratification and implementation by the EU and Member States of the international conventions that contain provisions on the confiscation of criminal proceeds, such as the:      UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (UNTOC);       UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC);       Council of Europe Conventions on Money Laundering and Confiscation (“Strasbourg Conventions”).      These conventions aim at promoting international cooperation in the identification, tracing, freezing and confiscation of criminal assets. Nevertheless, cooperation with third countries needs to be developed further, in particular through the promotion of asset-sharing agreements as well as the sharing of best practices.     The Commission also encourages the take-up of non-legislative measures, such as:      enhanced tools relating to the identification and tracing of assets, including centralised national registers to which the AROs should have access, and a list on outstanding freezing and confiscation orders in the EU;       a common EU training programme for financial investigations and criminal analysis, development of which is currently underway;       a methodology through which comparable statistics on frozen and confiscated assets may be made available, which is being developed in the context of the         EU Action Plan 2006-10 on crime statistics        .

act   Council Directive  98/24/EC  of 7 April 1998 on the protection of the health and safety of workers from the risks related to chemical agents at work (fourteenth individual directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive  89/391/EEC  ).   summary    SCOPE   Directive  98/24/EC  applies to workers exposed to hazardous chemicals when its provisions are more favourable than those of Directive  2004/37/EC  on the protection of workers from risks from carcinogens.  Framework Directive  89/391/EEC  , laying down minimum requirements for the protection of workers from health and safety risks from chemicals, applies in full, without prejudice to provisions that are more stringent or specific in this directive.  Following approval of Regulation (EC) No  1272/2008  on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, it was necessary to align the 1998 directive, and four others, with those new provisions. The changes were incorporated in Directive  2014/27/EU  . This identifies hazardous chemicals and informs users of the related risks through  standard symbols and wording on packaging labels and safety data sheets  .   EMPLOYERS’ OBLIGATIONS    Assessing risk   Employers must determine whether any hazardous chemicals are present and, if so, assess health and safety risks they might pose. This assessment must be kept up to date.   Preventing risks   Employers must take the necessary preventive measures to eliminate or reduce risks to the minimum. They should provide suitable equipment and reduce the duration of any exposure and safe handling, storage and transport of hazardous chemicals. Where possible, chemicals or processes must be replaced with less dangerous ones.  The legislation provides for indicative occupational exposure limit values to be established.   Dealing with accidents, incidents and emergencies   Employers must draw up action plans so that appropriate action, including informing those concerned, is taken when an accident occurs. These must be accompanied by regular safety drills and first-aid facilities.   Informing and training workers   Employers must provide workers with results of risk assessments, information on hazardous chemical substances on the premises and the relevant occupational exposure limit values. They must also supply training and details on appropriate precautions to be taken.   MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS    Bans   The directive bans the production, manufacture or use of certain chemicals. These are set out in Annex III. Exemptions are allowed under certain circumstances like scientific research and testing. In such cases, employers must provide authorities with information such as the quantities to be used and number of workers likely to be involved.   Health monitoring   EU countries must arrange appropriate health monitoring for workers whose health may be at risk. Individual health and exposure records are required.   Final provisions   EU countries report to the Commission every 5 years on the implementation of the various measures.

   Ageing well in the information society: The Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) Programme     Ageing well in the information society: The Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) Programme     European Union (EU) Member States are faced with an ageing population and its consequences on stability and economic competitiveness. The Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) Joint Programme supports the development of new technologies that contribute to the social inclusion of older people and allow them to stay active for longer.     SUMMARY     Decision N°       742/2008/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on the Community’s participation in a research and development programme undertaken by several Member States aimed at enhancing the quality of life of older people through the use of new information and communication technologies (Text with EEA relevance).     The Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) Joint Programme was set up on the initiative of several Member States to encourage research and development concerning the       ageing of the population and the use of information and communication technologies      (ICTs).     The programme is aimed at applied research for the development of products and services to enhance autonomy, employability and participation of older people in society.     The European Community is participating in the AAL Joint Programme which has been undertaken by several Member States within the meaning of Article 169 of the Treaty. It is co-financing activities of research, development and innovation through the ICT initiative of the       Specific Programme 'Cooperation'      implementing the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Development (       FP7      ).     The European Union (EU) Member states participating in the programme are: Germany, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Spain, France, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, the United Kingdom, Slovenia and Sweden.     In addition, some third countries, Israel, Norway and Switzerland, are participating in the programme by carrying out joint activities.     The States undertake to contribute to funding the programme. They must respect the Community regulations concerning State aid and intellectual property. They are, moreover, subject to transversal principles of scientific excellence, ethics, gender equality and contribution to sustainable development.      Implementation of the programme      The AAL Association is the body responsible for executing the programme. It has been created as an international non-profit association according to Belgian law. Its General Assembly is the decision-making body for the programme. The Commission participates in its meetings as an observer member.     In line with the general agreement and the financial agreements that it has concluded with the Commission, the AAL Association is responsible for:      preparing annual work programmes, procedures for calls for proposals and the selection and monitoring of projects;       the integration of national programmes in scientific, administrative and financial domains;       managing the Community’s financial contribution and in particular its transfer to national agencies managing the programme.      The national agencies will be responsible for receiving and allocating national financial contributions.      Monitoring and evaluation of the programme      The Commission and the European Court of Auditors will monitor the sound administration of the AAL Association. In addition, if the programme’s performance is not satisfactory or if national contributions are not paid, the Commission may withdraw its funding.     The results of the programme will be presented annually by the AAL Association, and also as part of FP7. The Commission will present two reports evaluating the programme to the Council and to the European Parliament, at an intermediary stage and then at the end of the programming period.      Context      The EU must take advantage of the extended life expectancy of its citizens and transform this       demographic challenge      into an opportunity. The ageing of the population must be considered in relation to the objectives for growth and employment in the       Renewed Lisbon Strategy      .

   European Job Mobility Action Plan (2007-2010)     European Job Mobility Action Plan (2007-2010)     The Commission proposes, in its action plan, a more integrated approach to job mobility focused on four elements: improving legislation and administrative practices, ensuring support for mobility by public authorities, strengthening the EURES network, and raising public awareness.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 6 December 2007 - Mobility, an instrument for more and better jobs: The European Job Mobility Action Plan (2007-2010) [       COM(2007) 773      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Although European workers seem more willing to be mobile than before, job mobility rates are increasing relatively slowly in the European Union (EU). Uncertainty as to the advantages of mobility and the numerous administrative and legal barriers present are among the reasons for this. It is thus essential to implement new actions to encourage mobility. This is why the Commission proposes, with a view to tackling the new challenges of mobility, an action plan consisting of four strands.      Action Plan 2007-2010       Improving existing legislation and administrative practices      is the first objective. Four actions are proposed in this field:      examining whether Community legislation needs to be amended to allow workers to move freely, according to the new mobility patterns, without losing their social protection;       legally strengthening the role of the TRESS network of independent experts in the area of social security coordination at European level (dissemination of knowledge, reports and expert advice). Consultation with stakeholders and an impact assessment should determine whether administrative practices or regulatory provisions need to be amended;       further simplifying national cooperation and administration practices (exchange and consultation of information electronically, launching an electronic version of the         European health insurance card        , etc.) in order to accelerate and facilitate the reimbursement of migrant workers’ social security expenditure;       concluding the proposals on the portability of supplementary pension rights in order to improve the acquisition and preservation of supplementary pension rights.      Moreover, combining flexibility and mobility (flexicurity (       es       fr      )) should contribute to the       Lisbon Strategy      , by making it possible for more workers to find more and better jobs.      Ensuring that the national, regional and local authorities promote mobility      at their respective levels is the second objective. In this respect, the Member States should:      make mobility a priority objective of their national strategy for employment and lifelong learning ;       learn from best practices through mutual learning programmes which may receive EU         Cohesion Policy        funding. In this context, an inventory of such programmes will be carried out and the possibility of developing European mobility programmes will be examined;       use the European Qualifications Framework, promote         Europass        and develop the European Credit Transfer System for Vocational Education and Training (ECVET).      In addition, regional and local authorities, education and training centres and civil society will be encouraged to remove practical obstacles and to promote ‘fair mobility’, which respects labour standards and legal provisions.     Moreover, several actions are proposed to       extend the scope and quality of the services provided by        EURES       in the area of worker mobility, namely:      increasing the provision of information and raising awareness on the principle of equal treatment and respect for labour standards within European markets;       stepping up the collection of strategic information in order to strengthen its analytical capacity;       enhancing the assistance provided to mobile workers in the EU, in particular with regard to specific categories of workers;       extending, in certain cases, some of these services to third-country nationals.      Action is planned on three fronts in order to       increase citizens’ awareness on mobility      :      organising annual ‘European Job Days’ not only to better inform citizens about their rights and the benefits of mobility but also to step up exchanges among the different stakeholders;       launching a ‘European Job Mobility Partnership’, and setting up a network to promote mobility;       incorporating into the         PROGRESS        programme support for the funding of pilot activities, the exchange of best practice, the dissemination of results on new developments and the emergence of innovative programmes.       Background      Job mobility must make it possible to confront the new challenges related to an ageing society and a constantly changing market, all the more so if one considers the new opportunities for both workers and employers following EU enlargement. The Lisbon Strategy and the European Employment Strategy have, furthermore, officially recognised increased geographical and occupational mobility as essential means of adapting in the context of rapidly changing labour markets. This Communication is intended to build on the series of initiatives to promote mobility.

act   Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Public-private partnerships in Horizon 2020: a powerful tool to deliver on innovation and growth in Europe (  COM(2013) 494  final,10.7.2013).   summary   To encourage EU research and innovation, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) includes two articles which have been used as a legal basis for establishing public-private and public-public partnerships in research and innovation:    Article 187 TFEU  covers  public-private partnerships  , typically involving the EU, industrial association(s) and other partners. These partnerships are managed by legal entities called  joint undertakings  which are responsible for implementing the research agenda in the area they cover.    Article 185 TFEU  covers  public-public partnerships,  with participation of the EU in research and development programmes undertaken by several EU countries.    Public-private partnerships   In meeting the objectives of  Horizon 2020  public private partnerships help to:   enable a long-term, strategic approach to research and innovation and reduce uncertainties by allowing for long-term commitments;   share common resources and critical mass thanks to their legal structure. This enables a scale of research effort that individual firms would not be able to achieve on their own. This is thanks to  smart specialisation  and the combining of Horizon 2020 and European structural and investment funding;   make research and innovation funding across the EU more efficient by sharing financial, human and infrastructure resources. This reduces the risk of fragmentation (i.e. where research is dispersed and uncoordinated), and leads to economies of scale and reduced costs for all partners involved;   better address complex challenges as they help develop interdisciplinary approaches and allow for a more efficient sharing of knowledge and expertise;   facilitate the creation of an internal market for innovative products and services, by advancing jointly on critical issues such as access to finance, standardisation and norm setting;   enable innovative technologies to get faster to the market, including by allowing companies to collaborate and share information, thereby accelerating the learning process;   provide the right framework for international companies to anchor their research and innovation investments in Europe and benefit from European strengths such as a well-trained workforce, diversity in approaches and sectorial creativity; and   enable the scale of research and innovation effort needed to address critical societal challenges and major EU policy objectives under the Europe 2020 strategy.   Some of the public-private partnerships under Horizon 2020 involve partnerships that were initially established under EU's seventh framework programme (FP7) for Research and Development (R&D) or are new partnerships:    Bio-based Industries  JTI JU, new under Horizon 2020,    Clean Sky 2  JTI JU, successor of the Clean Sky JTI JU,    ECSEL  (Electronic Components and Systems for European Leadership - a merger of the former ARTEMIS embedded systems JTI JU and of the former ENIAC nanoelectronics JTI JU, expanded to also address smart systems),    Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2  JTI JU, successor of the FCH JTI JU,    Innovative Medicines 2  JTI JU, successor of the IMI JTI JU.   Besides the abovementioned  JTI JUs  , another form of public-private partnership on the basis of Article 187 TFEU also operates under Horizon 2020:   the  Single European Sky ATM Research Joint Undertaking  (SESAR JU) established in FP7 will continue in Horizon 2020 (coordination of the technical pillar of the Single European Sky initiative which aims at modernising Air Traffic Management in Europe),   the  Shift2Rail Joint Undertaking  (S2R JU), new under Horizon 2020 (coordination and management of the Union research and innovation investments in the European rail sector).    Contractual Public-Private partnerships   Under Horizon 2020, these are based on a contractual arrangement between the Commission and industry partners (not under Art. 187 TFEU and different from the abovementioned institutionalised public private partnerships). These contractual public private partnerships were considered in the following areas:    Factories of the Future  ;    Energy-efficient Buildings  ;    Green Vehicles Initiative  ;    Sustainable Process Industry  ;    Photonics  ;    Robotics  ;    High Performance Computing  ;    Advanced 5G networks for the Future Internet  .    Public-public partnerships   Article 185 TFEU enables the EU to participate in research programmes undertaken jointly by several EU countries, including participation in the structures created for the execution of national programmes.  Some of the public-public partnerships under Horizon 2020 involve partnerships that were launched under previous Framework Programmes (FP6 or FP7) for R & D or are new partnerships:   the  Active and Assisted Living Research and Development Programme,    the second  European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership  (EDCTP 2),   the  European Metrology Programme for Innovation and Research  (EMPIR),   the  Eurostars 2 programme supporting research and development performing SMEs  .
   Application of Articles 107 and 108 TFEU to certain categories of horizontal State aid     Application of Articles 107 and 108 TFEU to certain categories of horizontal State aid     The Commission is empowered to adopt regulations establishing the compatibility of certain aid measures with the common market. These aid measures are exempt from the notification requirement of Article 108(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).     ACT     Council Regulation (EC) No       994/98      of 7 May 1998 on the application of Articles 87 (former Article 92) and 88 (former Article 93) of the Treaty establishing the European Community to certain categories of horizontal State aid.     SUMMARY     The Commission may, by means of regulations, declare that certain categories of aid are compatible with the common market and are not subject to the notification requirements of Article 108(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) (ex-Article 88(3) of the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC)). These categories include:      aid for small and medium-sized enterprises, research and development, environmental protection, employment and training;       aid that complies with the map approved by the Commission for each European Union (EU) country for the granting of regional aid.      The regulations must specify for each category of aid:      the purpose of the aid;       the categories of beneficiaries;       thresholds expressed either in terms of aid intensities in relation to a set of eligible costs or in terms of maximum aid amounts;       the conditions governing the cumulation of aid;       monitoring conditions.      The regulations may also:      set thresholds or other conditions for the notification of awards of individual aid;       exclude certain sectors as regards the compatibility of aid exempted under such regulations.      The Commission may, by means of regulations, decide that, having regard to the development and functioning of the common market, certain types of aid do not meet all the criteria of Article 107(1) TFEU (ex-Article 87(1) TEC) and that they are therefore exempted from the notification procedure under Article 108(3) TFEU, provided that aid granted to one and the same undertaking over a given period of time does not exceed a specified fixed amount.     When adopting the regulations, the Commission will impose detailed rules upon EU countries to ensure transparency and monitoring of the aid exempted from the notification requirement. The rules will include the following requirements:      EU countries must forward to the Commission summaries of the information regarding systems of aid or individual cases of aid not covered by the notification requirement as soon as they are implemented;       they must record and compile all the information regarding the application of the block exemptions;       they must supply the Commission once a year with a report on the application of block exemptions.      The regulations will apply for a specific period. They may be repealed or amended where circumstances have changed with respect to any important element that constituted grounds for their adoption or where the ongoing development or the functioning of the common market so requires.     Where the Commission intends to adopt a regulation, it must publish a draft thereof to enable all interested parties and organisations to submit their comments to it within a reasonable time limit.     Before publishing any draft regulation and before adopting any regulation, the Commission will consult the Advisory Committee on State Aid, which is composed of representatives of the EU countries and chaired by the representative of the Commission.     Every five years the Commission will submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a report on the application of Regulation (EC) No 994/98.      References           Act               Entry into force               Deadline for transposition in the Member States               Official Journal               Regulation (EC) No                 994/98                15.5.1998               -               OJ L 142 of 14.5.1998          RELATED ACT      Commission         Regulation (EC) No 800/2008        of 6 August 2008 declaring certain categories of aid compatible with the common market in application of Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty (General block exemption Regulation) (Text with EEA relevance) [Official Journal L 214 of 9.8.2008].       Commission         Regulation (EC) No 1998/2006        of 15 December 2006 on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty to de minimis aid [Official Journal L 379 of 28.12.2006].       Report from the Commission to the Council and European Parliament of 21 December 2006 on the application of Council Regulation (EC) No         994/98        of 7 May 1998 regarding the application of Articles 87 (ex-Article 92) and 88 (ex-Article 93) of the EC Treaty to certain categories of horizontal State aid, pursuant to Article 5 of this Regulation [         COM(2006) 831        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      The report on the implementation of block exemption regulations for State aid is largely positive.     The Commission has adopted several block exemption regulations under Regulation (EC) No 994/98, particular as regards de minimis aid and aid for SMEs, employment and training.     The report shows that the extent to which exemption regulations are used varies considerably depending on the desired objective (e.g. high use for aid to SMEs, but relatively low use for employment aid), and on the EU country in question (most measures are taken by Italy, the United Kingdom, Germany and Spain).     That said, for reasons of legal certainty, EU countries continue to notify aid measures that could be implemented under a block exemption regulation.     On the basis of its experience and the guidelines given in the       State Aid Action Plan      , the Commission is soon to propose a general block exemption regulation bringing together all existing ones. Certain types of environmental aid will be included at this stage.     Last updated: 18.10.2011

act   Council Decision  94/358/EC  of 16 June 1994 accepting, on behalf of the European Community, the Convention on the elaboration of a European Pharmacopoeia.   summary   On 22 July 1964, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom (   1   ) signed a Convention, drawn up under the aegis of the Council of Europe, on the elaboration of a European Pharmacopoeia.  The objectives are to harmonise specifications for medicinal substances of general interest to the population of Europe and to hasten the drawing-up of specifications for the growing number of new medicinal substances appearing on the market.  These objectives are met by creating a European Pharmacopoeia comprising monographs which become official standards applicable in the territories of the countries which are Contracting Parties to the Convention.  On 16 November 1989 a Protocol to this Convention was signed in order to enable the European Community to accede to it. It entered into force on 1 November 1992.  The European Pharmacopoeia currently has 38 European members, including the European Union (EU). The 37 member countries are:   the EU-15, namely Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom (   1   );   three of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries, namely Iceland, Norway and Switzerland;   the thirteen most recent Member States of the EU, namely Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Bulgaria and Romania;   the four EU candidate countries, namely the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey;   Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Ukraine.   The European Pharmacopoeia also has 26 observers, including the World Health Organisation (WHO). The 25 observer countries are:   six European countries, namely Albania, Republic of Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Moldova and the Russian Federation;   nineteen non-European countries, namely Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Canada, China, Israel, Madagascar, Malaysia, Morocco, Republic of Guinea, Senegal, Singapore, South Africa, Syria, the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (TFDA) of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Tunisia and the United States.   The elaboration of the European Pharmacopoeia is undertaken by two bodies:   the European Pharmacopoeia Commission, which prepares and adopts the technical decisions relating to monographs. It comprises eminent scientists appointed by each Contracting Party and chosen for their competence in certain fields;   the Public Health Committee of the Council of Europe, which exercises administrative authority over the Commission's activities and sets the date of application of the monographs but cannot interfere with their technical content.

summary of   Communication (COM(99) 643 final) — support plan to combat doping in sport   what is the aim of the communication  It sets out the action planned and taken to tackle doping in sport, including the use of European Union (EU) instruments (research, education and training, youth, police and the judicial cooperation, public health) and the coordination of existing legislative measures.   key points   The communication set out a three-layered approach to tackle doping in sport:   assemble  experts’ opinions  on the ethical, legal and scientific dimensions of doping;   contribute to preparing the 1999 World Anti-Doping Conference and to creating the  World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)  ;   mobilise  EU instruments  with a view to supplementing the actions already underway in EU countries and to give them an EU dimension, taking account of the growing mobility of European sportspersons and the EU’s powers in relation to doping.    European Group on Ethics   The  European Commission  has committed itself to taking into account, in its future actions and deliberations, elements of the opinion of the  European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE)  . This group has set out the  ethical principles  on which the EU measures must be based:   the rights of everyone, both sportspersons and others, to  safety and health  ;   the principle of  integrity and transparency  , for the sake of which the consistency of sporting competitions must be ensured and the image of sport in general preserved;   the special attention which must be paid to the most  vulnerable people  and, in particular, children, who can be very involved in high-level sport.   On the basis of these principles, the EGE suggested a number of  measures  including:   establishing an effective  health monitoring system for athletes  , in particular a specialised medical, psychological and information service;   adopting a directive on the  protection of young athletes  , in particular those who aspire to become professional;   encouraging  research  into the health of athletes;   increased  police and judicial cooperation  ;   incorporating conditions relating to doping and its prohibition in athletes’  contracts  .    Anti-doping agencies    Doping prevention and doping sanctions are the responsibility of sport organisations and EU countries.   The Commission supports the fight against doping and role of WADA,  national anti-doping organisations, accredited laboratories  , the  Council of Europe  and  UNESCO  .    EU Expert Group on anti-doping  submitted the first EU revisions to WADA’s World Anti-Doping Code in 2012.   Commission has worked with EU countries to ensure that all rules and procedures linked to new 2015  World Anti-Doping Code  comply with EU law and the EU’s vision of an athlete-friendly anti-doping system.    EU instruments   Actions using EU instruments come in 2 forms:   better  coordination  of regulatory measures;   mobilisation of  EU programmes  which can support positive anti-doping measures at European level.   These actions focus on the following:   intensifying efforts to identify doping substances, detection methods, the health consequences of doping and doping as a socio-economic phenomenon;   mobilising education, vocational training and youth programmes in the service of information and training, awareness-raising and prevention programmes;   making full use of police and judicial cooperation programmes;   reinforcing drugs information;   developing public health policy measures.   A 2011 Commission  communication  encouraged EU countries to:   adopt and share national anti-doping action plans aimed at ensuring coordination among all relevant parties;   continue the existing trend across EU countries to introduce  criminal law rules against trade in doping substances  by organised networks, or to reinforce existing rules.     background   For more information, see    ‘Anti-doping’  on the European Commission's website.
summary of   Directive 2009/38/EC — establishment of a European Works Council (or a system for informing and consulting employees working for Community-scale companies and groups of companies)   summary    what does this directive do  It aims to ensure information* and consultation* rights on transnational issues for staff in Community-scale* companies (with at least 1,000 employees) or groups* of companies. It achieves this by establishing a European works council or other appropriate procedures.   key points    Through European works councils, workers are informed and consulted at transnational level by management on the progress of the business and any significant decisions that could affect them.   Central management is responsible for providing the information allowing negotiations to set up a European works council or information and consultation procedures.   The detailed arrangements are worked out between the central management and employee representatives sitting on a special negotiating body.   Employee representatives, or any experts who advise them, may not reveal information expressly provided to them in confidence.   Members of the European works council must have the means to apply the rights the legislation gives. This includes training of employee representatives without any loss of wages.   Initially, EU countries could exclude merchant navy crews from the legislation. However, they were included in an amendment adopted in October 2015 (Directive (EU)  2015/1794  ).   from when does the directive apply  It entered into force on 5 June 2009. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 5 June 2011.   background   In 2016, the Commission services will examine the impact(s) of the implementation of Directive 2009/38/EC Directive, and in particular those resulting from the changes made to Directive  94/45/EC  (the original legislation on European works councils which Directive 2009/38/EC replaced).   key terms    * Information  : transmission of data by the employer to employee representatives to enable them to understand an issue and assess its impact.   * Consultation  : dialogue between central management and employers' representatives to allow the latter to express an opinion.   * Community-scale company  : one with at least 1,000 employees in more than one EU country and 150 staff in a minimum of 2 of them.   * Community-scale group of companies  : a group with at least 1 000 employees overall, 2 companies in different EU countries and a 150 staff in a minimum of 2 of them.   act   Directive  2009/38/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 on the establishment of a European Works Council or a procedure in Community-scale undertakings and Community-scale groups of undertakings for the purposes of informing and consulting employees (Recast) (OJ L 122, 16.5.2009, pp. 28–44)  Successive amendments and corrections to Directive 2009/38/EC have been incorporated in the basic text. This  consolidated version  is for reference purposes only.   related act   Directive (EU)  2015/1794  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 October 2015 amending Directives 2008/94/EC, 2009/38/EC and 2002/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, and Council Directives 98/59/EC and 2001/23/EC, as regards seafarers (OJ L 263, 8.10.2015, pp. 1–5)
   Information procedures: technical standards and regulations and regulations on information society services     Information procedures: technical standards and regulations and regulations on information society services     This Directive aims to eliminate or reduce the barriers to the free movement of goods which can arise from the adoption of different national technical regulations, by encouraging transparency of national initiatives vis-à-vis the European Commission, European standardisation bodies and other Member States.     ACT     Directive       98/34/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     Directive 98/34/EC consolidates and thus replaces Directive       83/189/EEC      . It provides for two information procedures, one for standards (voluntary technical specifications) and the other for technical regulations (obligatory technical specifications) on industrial, agricultural and fishing products.      Information procedure for standards      Each national standardisation body informs the Commission and all the other European and national standardisation bodies specified in the Annexes to the Directive of its draft standards or amendments to existing standards. The Commission may also request that it be informed of national standardisation programmes that will then be made available to the Member States.     The Commission and the other standardisation bodies may comment on draft standards, in which case they will be informed of the follow-up. Moreover, national standardisation bodies are able to participate in other Member States' standardisation work.     The information procedure does not apply to draft national standards transposing international or European standards.      The information procedure for technical rules      :     Every Member State must notify the Commission of its draft technical rules or amendment of technical regulations, the grounds for them and, where necessary, the main basic legislative and regulatory provisions of the draft regulation. Where the draft limits the marketing or use of a chemical substance for public health, consumer or environmental protection reasons, the characteristics, effects and risks of the product must also be specified.     The Commission will inform all the other Member States of the draft notified. Their comments will be taken into account, where possible, in the final version of the technical regulation.     In order to allow the Commission and other Member States to react, the Member States must refrain from adopting any draft technical regulations for three months from the date of receipt by the Commission. The standstill period is extended to 4 months for drafts in the form of a voluntary agreement and for 6 months for all others where the Commission delivers a detailed opinion indicating that the draft may impede the free movement of goods. If the Commission wishes to propose or adopt a legislative act in the same area or if the draft concerns a subject already covered by a Commission proposal, the Member State concerned must suspend adoption of the draft for 12 months. If the Council adopts a common position during this period, the standstill period will be extended by six months (18 months in total).     The notification procedure does not apply to technical regulations that are an integral transposition of an international or European standard - in which case the Commission should simply be informed - nor to national regulations on Community technical specifications or to other provisions of Community law.      Committees      The Directive establishes a permanent Committee of Member States' representatives, chaired by a Commission representative. The Commission consults this Committee on:      twice-yearly reports on the implementation of the Directive and the proposals aiming to eliminate technical barriers to trade, in which case the Committee may recommend the preparation of a European standard by the European standardisation bodies or Community harmonisation of a particular sector;       amendments to lists of European and national standardisation bodies in Annexes I and II to the Directive;       rules for the presentation of standards and standardisation programmes which the national standardisation bodies must follow within the framework of the information procedure on standards;       amendment of procedures established by the Directive, etc...      The Commission may consult the Committee on technical draft regulations notified by the Member States and, at the Committee's or a Member State's request, on any other matter on the implementation of the Directive.     The Committee's work is confidential, but it may call upon the private sector for expertise providing that precautions are taken.

summary of   Regulation (EU) No 978/2012 applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences   what is the aim of the regulation   In 2012, the European Union (EU) agreed new rules to refocus this scheme, which has been in place since 1971. They make the system  more transparent and predictable  for beneficiary countries, especially in view of the changed global trade patterns over the past decade. The scheme is now directed at  those countries in greatest need  .   The regulation does not include countries that already enjoy preferences under free trade agreements with the EU, or under ‘autonomous’ arrangements with the bloc (usually temporary, pending the conclusion of more comprehensive, longer-term agreements with the EU).   key points   The EU’s scheme of generalised tariff preferences (GSP) allows developing countries to pay lower tariffs on their exports to the EU. This helps boost their economies.   3 strands of the scheme     standard GSP  – tariffs for goods imported from a developing country are reduced or suspended.  Exception  – this does not apply if a country has been classified by the World Bank as a high or upper-middle income country for 3 consecutive years immediately before the EU updates the list of beneficiary countries    GSP+ (incentive scheme)  – even lower tariffs for countries which ratify and implement 27 specified international conventions covering human and labour rights, environment and good governance.    EBA (Everything But Arms), for least-developed countries  – full tariff and quota-free imports for all goods from the  UN-defined least developed countries (LDCs)  , except for arms.    Suspension of countries   The EU may temporarily suspend the lower tariffs for reasons such as:    violations of core principles  in human and labour rights conventions    unfair trading practices     serious shortcomings in customs controls  (e.g. export or transit of illegal drugs)   if the national law of a GSP+ beneficiary country  no longer incorporates the relevant conventions  (or that law is not effectively implemented).    Discontinuation as countries develop    Some countries can be poor but still develop highly competitive export industries. Once this happens, they no longer need preferences to successfully penetrate EU markets.   The GSP scheme therefore  withdraws preferences  from countries with such competitive product sectors on the basis of a ‘graduation’ mechanism.    More stable & predictable    The new GSP, because it lasts 10 years (it was 3 in the past), offers importers and exporters more stability and predictability.   Exporters know that, where changes are made in the beneficiaries’ list, there are transition periods of at least 1 year. Countries now have the security of knowing that they can be removed from the beneficiary lists only if the UN lists them as high or upper-middle income 3 years in a row.    Temporary import restrictions   The EU may apply  safeguard measures  (temporary restrictions) if imports from beneficiary countries cause or threaten to cause ‘serious difficulty’ to an EU producer. It may also apply surveillance measures for farm products. None of these measures has ever been taken in the history of the scheme.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 20 November 2012.   background   For more information, see:    ‘Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP)’  on the European Commission's website.
   Anti-tax fraud measures     Anti-tax fraud measures     The aim of this Communication is to spark off a discussion on a European strategy for combating fiscal fraud. Levels of tax fraud are on the increase, and Member States can no longer act in isolation. The Commission is proposing a new Community approach to administrative cooperation with third countries and is prepared to engage in a discussion on the need to modify VAT systems. It is also proposing to develop cooperation between Member States by strengthening measures relating to indirect taxation and by improving Community legislation in the field of direct taxation and assistance in the recovery of taxes.     ACT     Commission Communication, dated 31 May 2006, to the Council, the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee concerning the need to develop a coordinated strategy to improve the fight against fiscal fraud [       COM(2006) 254      - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This communication seeks to trigger a debate based on lines of reflection regarding the factors to be taken into account in the context of developing a coordinated strategy at European level to improve the fight against fiscal fraud.      Administrative cooperation between Member States      With a view to improving administrative cooperation between Member States, the Commission proposes to:      strengthen not merely the legislation but also the practical measures employed regarding cooperation in the field of direct and indirect taxation and assistance in the recovery of taxes;       improve risk management so as to enable Member States to focus their inspection efforts on the sectors and companies considered to represent a major fraud risk;       create a permanent Forum for administrative cooperation at Community level for all direct and indirect taxes.       Cooperation with third countries      Given that tax fraud does not stop at the external borders of the European Union (EU), the Commission is proposing the adoption of a Community approach to cooperation with third countries.      Modifications to existing VAT and excise systems      With a view to reducing the cases of fraud, the Commission is launching a debate on possible modifications that could be made to the existing common VAT and excise systems.     Among the potential avenues to be explored in the VAT sector are the possibility not only of strengthening the principle of joint and several liability for the payment of VAT but also of extending the use of the reverse charge mechanism. In all the cases cited, the Communication lays down the conditions to be met by the new VAT system.     In the excise sector, thought is being given to the current tobacco taxation structure.      Other avenues to be explored      The Commission is also proposing that the discussions should include a range of more specific measures such as:      increasing tax declaration obligations for companies considered to represent a risk;       reducing these obligations for companies which obtain an authorisation by entering into a partnership with the tax authorities;       using standardised, high-performance IT tools for the rapid exchange of information.       BACKGROUND      In 2004, tax revenues (total tax take plus compulsory social security contributions) represented 39.3% of GDP (gross domestic product) in the EU. Tax fraud accounts for approximately 2 to 2.5% of GDP, i.e. between 200 billion and 250 billion. Tax fraud constitutes an obstacle to the smooth operation of the internal market inasmuch as it leads to significant distortion of competition among taxpayers.     RELATED ACTS      Commission Communication, dated 25 October 2005, to the Council and the European Parliament - The Contribution of Taxation and Customs Policies to the Lisbon Strategy [         COM(2005) 532        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      This Communication launches a plan for EU-wide       taxation and customs measures      that would help the EU to achieve its       Lisbon objectives      . The Commission is in favour of a more concerted and coordinated approach at Community level so as to enable the Member States to combat tax fraud more efficiently.      Commission Communication, dated 27 September 2004, to the Council and the European Parliament on preventing and combating corporate and financial malpractice [         COM (2004) 611        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      This Communication seeks to provide a global method for reducing the risk of       corporate and financial malpractice      , combining in equal measure the fiscal, judicial and law enforcement dimensions.      Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 July 2004 on mutual administrative assistance for the protection of the financial interests of the Community against fraud and any other illegal activities [         COM(2004) 509        final - Not published in the Official Journal] [         COD/2004/0172        procedure].       Amended by:       Amended Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on mutual administrative assistance for the protection of the financial interests of the European Community against fraud and any other illegal activities [         COM(2006) 473        final - Not published in the Official Journal] [         COD/2004/0172        ].       Regulation (EC) No         1798/2003        of 7 October 2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No         218/92        [Official Journal L 264, 15.10.2003].      This Regulation establishes a common system of administrative cooperation and exchange of information between the competent authorities of the Member States to ensure proper application of VAT and to       combat fraud      .      Decision No         1152/2003/EC        of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 on computerising the movement and surveillance of excisable products [Official Journal L 162, 1.7.2003, p. 5].       Council Directive         2003/48/EC        of 3 June 2003 on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments [Official Journal L 157, 26.6.2003].      The ultimate aim of this Directive is to enable       savings interest      received in one Member State by natural persons who are resident for tax purposes in another Member State to be made subject to effective taxation in accordance with the laws of the latter Member State.      Council Directive         77/799/EEC        of 19 December 1977 concerning mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the Member States in the field of direct taxation and taxation of insurance premiums [Official Journal L 336, 27.12.1977].      With a view to combating international tax evasion and avoidance, this Directive strengthens       collaboration between the Member States' tax administrations      , while at the same time facilitating the exchange of information that appears relevant for the correct assessment of taxes on income and on capital.

summary of   Directive 2014/25/EU on procurement by entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors   what is the aim of the directive   It sets out rules on the use of public contracts by companies or individuals in the water, energy, transport and postal sectors to obtain works, supplies or services.   Although the basic rules and principles laid down in  Directive 2014/24/EU  . apply to the water, energy, transport and postal sectors, Directive 2014/25/EU takes account of the specific features of these sectors which play key roles in meeting society’s needs.   key points    Thresholds   Contracts must be issued by national, regional or local authorities, public undertakings or entities benefiting from special or exclusive rights (i.e. the entities covered by this directive), according to the directive’s rules, when the sums involved are above the following ceilings (valid from 1 January 2016):   €418 000 for supply and service contracts and design contests;   €5 225 000 for works contracts;   €1 000 000 for service contracts for social and other specific services.   The  European Commission  assesses these thresholds every 2 years to determine whether they should be changed in accordance with the EU’s international obligations.   Activities covered   The directive applies to  public procurement  in:   gas and heat sectors, electricity and water (when it is a service to be provided to the public and in connection with their production), transport or distribution;   public transport by railway, tram, trolley, bus or cable car;   airports, maritime and inland ports and other terminals for air, sea or canals;   postal services and other businesses which provide the public with similar services involving the clearance, sorting, routing and delivery of postal items;   oil and gas extraction and exploration for, or extraction of, coal and other solid fuels.    Exemptions   The directive does not apply to contracts:   on the resale or lease of items to another company or organisation;   for works or services in all previously mentioned sectors in a non-EU country;   covered by other public procurement or international legal obligations (e.g. the World Trade Organisation Agreement on Government Procurement);   subject to  Directive 2009/81/EEC  or excluded therefrom (contracts involving defence or security aspects).    New standard forms for procurement notices   Commission Implementing Regulation (EU)  2015/1986  introduces new standard forms for publishing public procurement notices. These new forms applied to all new public procurement notices until 18 April 2016.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 17 April 2014. EU countries had to incorporate it into national by 18 April 2016.   background   General EU legislation setting out the rules for public purchasing is contained in Directive 2014/24/EU. These rules lay down the procedures to be followed and stipulate that national authorities, when using public procurement to invite tenders for work they wish carried out, must treat all applicants equally and avoid any discrimination between them. They must also be transparent in the way in which they operate and take decisions.  For more information, see:    ‘Public procurement’  on the European Commission’s website.
   Turkey – Enterprises     Turkey – Enterprises     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM(2011) 666      final – SEC(2011) 1201 – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The       2011 Report      notes the substantial progress made with regard to enterprise policy and industrial policy, to the extent that they now comply with almost all of the criteria of the       acquis      . An effective action plan and industrial strategy must be implemented for the period 2011-2014.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission’s words)      EU       industrial policy      seeks to promote       industrial strategies      which strengthen competitiveness by accelerating adaptation to structural changes and encouraging a framework conducive to the creation and development of enterprises across the EU and to national and foreign investment. It also seeks to improve the overall business environment in which       small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)      operate. It presupposes a process of       privatisation      and       restructuring      (see also Chapter 8 – Competition policy). The Community strategy in this area essentially involves defining fundamental principles and drawing up industrial policy declarations. The implementation of enterprise policy and industrial policy requires an adequate administrative capacity at national, regional and local level.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      Turkey has made further progress in the area of       enterprise and industrial policy      , where Turkey maintains a sufficient level of alignment with the       acquis.      The progress relates to the adoption of an Industrial Strategy and Action Plan covering the period 2011-2014, the wider availability of enterprise and industrial policy instruments, the adoption of sectoral strategies and alignment on combating late payment in commercial transactions.     RELATED ACTS      Commission Report [         COM(2010) 660        final – SEC(2010) 1327 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2010 Report noted a satisfactory level of alignment with the       acquis      of the legislation concerning enterprises and industrial policy. However, the improvements made to the business environment remained inadequate.      Commission Report [         COM(2009) 533        final – SEC(2009) 1334 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The Report noted that Turkish legislation was now satisfactorily aligned with the Community       acquis      . New progress had been made, in particular, in the establishment of comprehensive and sectoral industrial strategies.      Commission Report [         COM(2008) 674        final – SEC(2008) 2699 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The November 2008 Report noted the new progress achieved regarding SME policy and the improvement to the business environment. However, Turkey had not yet adopted the revised comprehensive industrial strategy.      Commission Report [         COM(2007) 663        final – SEC(2007) 1436 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The November 2007 Report noted that overall, Turkey has achieved a good degree of alignment with the       acquis      in the field of enterprise policy and industrial policy.      Commission Report [         COM(2006) 649        final – SEC(2005) 1390 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The November 2006 Report noted the substantial progress achieved by Turkey and specified what progress had yet to be made.      Commission Report [         COM(2005) 561        final – SEC(2005) 1426 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The October 2005 Report noted further progress. Turkey's industrial policy was then largely in line with the fundamental principals of the common industrial policy. However, Turkey had to continue its efforts to make further progress and to build on the advances already made.      Commission Report [         COM(2004) 656        final – SEC(2004) 1201 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The October 2004 Report highlighted Turkey’s progress with regard to its industrial policy. Although Turkey had achieved a degree of conformity with Community principles in this field, further efforts were nevertheless required.      Commission Report [         COM(2003) 676        final – SEC(2003) 1212 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The November 2003 Report stated that Turkey had made some progress with its industrial policy. Efforts did, however, need to be made in terms of privatisation. The same applied to SMEs, where the business climate and access to funding remained uncertain.      Commission Report [         COM(2002) 700        final – SEC (2002) 1412 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The October 2002 Report noted that Turkey had made little progress in the field of industrial policy and a policy in favour of SMEs.      Commission Report [         COM(2001) 700        final – SEC (2001) 1756 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The November 2001 Report stated that Turkey had continued to stabilise the macroeconomic situation. Little progress had been made with the policy on enterprise and industry. The policy on SMEs and the system of support for enterprises had been revised.      Commission Report [         COM(2000) 713        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      In its November 2000 Report, the Commission noted that the main progress had been achieved in the privatisation of state enterprises.      Commission Report [         COM(1999) 513 final        – Not published in the Official Journal].      In its 1999 Report, the Commission stressed that Turkish industry had been influenced by negative international macroeconomic developments.

summary of   Regulation (EU) 2016/127 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 609/2013 as regards the specific compositional and information requirements for infant formula and follow-on formula and as regards requirements on information relating to infant and young child feeding   what is the aim of the regulation   It supplements Regulation (EU) No  609/2013  on  foods for specific groups  , which requires the  European Commission  to adopt composition and labelling rules for  infant formula   *  and  follow-on formula   *  , through a  delegated act  , and based on the latest scientific advice.   It bans nutritional and health claims on infant formula to protect and encourage breast-feeding.   It helps national authorities to better monitor the infant formula market through additional notification rules.   key points   Directive  2006/141/EC  is repealed from 22 February 2020 but will continue to apply until 21 February 2021 to infant formula and follow-on formula manufactured from  protein hydrolysates  .  Infant formula or follow-on formula not manufactured entirely from cows’ milk or goats’ milk proteins must carry the official names prescribed in each EU language. In English they are respectively ‘Infant formula’ and ‘Follow-on formula’.   Ingredients   Infant formula and follow-on formula must:   comply with this regulation, and with other relevant horizontal rules of EU food law, including Regulation (EU) No  1169/2011  on providing  food information to consumers  ;   follow the compositional requirements of the regulation that are applicable to products ready for use marketed as such or to products ready for use after preparation as instructed by the manufacturers;   require nothing more than the addition of water if marketed as ready for use or ready after preparation in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions;   be manufactured from protein sources as set out in the regulation and other food ingredients, whose suitability for infants from birth (for infant formula) or for infants aged over six months (for follow-on formula) is established by generally accepted scientific data;   not contain pesticide residues exceeding 0.01 mg/kg per active substance, with certain exceptions;   not be made from agricultural products using pesticides containing the banned substances listed in the regulation, subject to a maximum residue value for the purposes of checking;   No product other than infant formula may be marketed or represented as suitable to satisfy the nutritional requirements of normal healthy infants during the first months of life.   Food information   Formula must comply with Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 on providing food information to consumers, with the following additional information:   a statement that the product is suitable for infants from birth when they are not breast fed (infant formula only);   an ‘Important Notice’ (also included in advertising) about the superiority of breast feeding and a statement recommending that the product be used only on professional advice (infant formula only);   a statement that the product is suitable only for infants over 6 months, only as part of a diversified diet, not to be used as a substitute for breast milk during the first 6 months and that the decision to begin complementary feeding should be made only on professional advice based on the individual infant’s specific growth and development needs (follow-on formula only);   instructions for a preparation, storage and disposal of the product and a warning against the health hazards of inappropriate preparation and storage.   The labelling, presentation and advertising of infant formula and follow-on formula must provide the necessary information about the  appropriate use  of the products. This is so as not to discourage breast feeding, and the information provided must avoid any risk of confusion between infant formula and follow-on formula.  In addition to the information referred to in Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011, the  mandatory nutrition declaration  for infant formula and follow-on formula must include the amount of each mineral substance and of each vitamin listed in annexes to this regulation respectively and present in the product, with the exception of molybdenum and the amount of salt.  The  mandatory nutrition declaration  may be supplemented with the amounts of components of protein, carbohydrate or fat and the whey protein/casein ratio, and other substances listed in the annexes to this regulation or Regulation (EU) No 609/2013.   Nutrition and health claims  must not be made on infant formula.  The statement ‘  lactose only  ’ may only be used where lactose is the only carbohydrate present in the product. The statement ‘  lactose free  ’ is for use only where the lactose content is not greater than 2.5 mg/100 kJ (10 mg/100 kcal).  When the statement ‘  lactose free  ’ is used for formula manufactured from protein sources other than soya protein isolates, it must be accompanied by the statement ‘not suitable for infants with galactosaemia  *  ’. The statement ‘contains Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)  *  ’ or ‘contains DHA’ (as required by the legislation for all infant formula) may only be used for infant formula placed on the market before 22 February 2025.   Advertising and promotion   Advertising of infant formula, which must contain only information of a scientific and factual nature, is  restricted  to publications specialising in baby care and scientific publications. EU countries can apply  stricter rules  such as banning such advertising, Advertising must not imply or create a belief that bottle-feeding is equivalent or superior to breast feeding.  There must be  no point-of-sale advertising, free samples or any other promotional device  to induce sales of infant formula directly to the consumer.   Feeding information   EU countries must ensure that  objective information  is provided on infant and young child feeding. Informational and educational materials must include clear information on the following:   the benefits and superiority of breast feeding;   maternal nutrition and the preparation for and maintenance of breast feeding;   the possible negative effect on breast feeding of introducing partial bottle feeding;   the difficulty of reversing the decision not to breast feed;   where needed, the proper use of infant formula.   Such information must include the  social and financial implications  of the use of infant formula, the health hazards of inappropriate foods or feeding methods, and the health hazards of improper use of infant formula. It must not contain any pictures which could idealise the use of infant formula.   Notification   When infant formula is placed on the market, the food business operator's requirement to notify national authorities of the launch of new products is extended to follow-on formulae, and must include submitting a model of the label used and all relevant information considered necessary to demonstrate compliance with the regulation.   from when does the regulation apply  It applies from 22 February 2020, except for the rules about formula manufactured from protein hydrolysates, which apply from 22 February 2021.   background   For more information, see:    Food for infants and young children  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Infant formula:  food used by infants (children under 12 months of age) during the first months of life and satisfying by themselves the nutritional requirements of such infants until the introduction of appropriate complementary feeding.   Follow-on formula:  food used by infants when appropriate complementary feeding is introduced and constituting the principal liquid element in a progressively diversified diet of such infants.   Galactosaemia:  a condition where galactose, one of the components of lactose, the sugar found in milk, cannot be used by an infant.   Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA):  fatty acids naturally found in breast milk and important in early brain and eye development.

act   Regulation (EC) No  1523/2007  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2007 banning the placing on the market and the import to, or export from, the Community of cat and dog fur, and products containing such fur.   summary   The Regulation bans the placing on the market and the import to or export from the European Union (EU) of cat and dog fur and products containing such fur.  The ban may exceptionally be subject to derogations by the Commission, for educational or taxidermy purposes.  By 31 December 2008, the Member States had to inform the Commission of the analytical methods they use to identify the species of origin of fur (e.g. MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry). The Commission may adopt measures establishing analytical methods to be used in this sphere.  By 31 December 2008, the Member States had to lay down appropriate penalties to ensure that the ban is complied with and notify those provisions to the Commission.  By 31 December 2010, the Commission had to report on the application of the Regulation.   Background   The Treaty does not allow the Community to legislate on the basis of ethical concerns. That is why the proposal is based on the possibility, confirmed by consistent Court of Justice case-law, of adopting measures aimed at preventing obstacles that may affect the functioning of the Internal Market, in this case in the fur trade sector.  Several Member States had in fact already taken measures to restrict trade in cat and dog fur on their territory, forcing professionals in this sector to comply with different obligations depending on the country.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 377/2004 creating an immigration liaison officers network   what is the aim of the regulation  It aims to establish formal cooperation by setting up networks of  immigration liaison officers  (ILOs)  *  .   key points   Many  EU  countries deploy ILOs to their consular authorities in non-EU countries. The ILOs’ role includes maintaining direct contacts with the authorities in the host country  to facilitate exchanges of information  concerning:   flows of  irregular migrants   *  originating from or transiting through the host country;   the routes followed by those flows of migrants;   the existence of criminal organisations involved in the smuggling of migrants and their methods of operation;   possible factors that may influence new developments and trends with respect to these irregular flows of migrants;   the methods used to falsify identity documents and travel documents;   identifying scope for assistance to the authorities in non-EU countries in preventing these irregular migration flows;   how to optimise the facilitation of the return of irregular migrants to their countries of origin.   EU countries must inform one another, the  Council  and the  European Commission  of their secondments of immigration liaison officers.  ILOs deployed to the same country form  local networks  in which they, in particular:   exchange information and practical experience, specifically through regular meetings;   coordinate positions to be adopted in contacts with commercial carriers;   attend joint specialised training courses and organise training sessions for consular officers of EU countries posted in the host country;   adopt common approaches as to methods of gathering information;   establish contact with similar networks established in the host country and neighbouring countries.   Meetings are held either at the initiative of the EU country holding the Council presidency or at the initiative of other EU countries. Representatives of the Commission and the  European Border and Coast Guard  participate in them unless operational considerations require meetings to be held in their absence.  EU countries may bilaterally or multilaterally agree that ILOs posted by an EU country also look after the interests of one or more other EU countries. They may also decide to share certain tasks among themselves.  At the end of each semester, the EU country holding the Presidency of the Council of the EU draws up a  report  for the  European Parliament  , the Council and the Commission  on the activities of the ILOs  in the countries and regions of particular interest to the EU with regard to immigration. This report is drawn up in accordance with a model provided in Commission Decision  2005/687/EC  . On the basis of this report, the Commission then drafts an annual summary of the development of the ILO networks.   Evaluation and proposed recast of the regulation   The Commission’s 2017  communication  on the Delivery of the European Agenda on Migration confirmed the need to revise the regulation. This followed an  evaluation  carried out by external consultants which produced its final report in August 2017. The evaluation concluded that:   ILOs remain highly relevant in the external context with respect to the EU’s approach to dealing with the impact of irregular migration; but   the regulation has had a limited and mostly indirect impact in terms of enhancing networking among EU countries’ ILOs deployed in the same location and improving coordination of the EU’s position with regard to host countries.   It also suggested that the added value at European level of ILOs deployed in non-EU countries had not been fully realised.  The Commission, therefore, issued a  proposal  to  recast  the regulation in May 2018.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 5 January 2004.   background   For more information, see:    Immigration Liaison Officers’ Networks  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Immigration liaison officer (ILO):  a representative of an EU country posted abroad by a relevant competent authority in order to establish and maintain contacts with the authorities of the host country with a view to contributing to migration measures including the prevention of irregular immigration.   Irregular migrants:  the movement of persons to a new place of residence or transit that takes place outside the regulatory norms of the sending, transit and receiving countries.
   Strategy for the evolution of the Customs Union     Strategy for the evolution of the Customs Union     The Commission aims at complementing the reform and adoption of the Modernised Customs Code and the pan-European electronic customs system by improving the organisation and working methods of customs administrations.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 1 April 2008 entitled Strategy for the evolution of the Customs Union [       COM(2008) 169      final- Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The Customs Union, which celebrates its 40th anniversary in 2008, is undergoing a major review. The Commission and Member States have identified the need to adapt to changing production and consumption patterns, increasing international trade and to global threats such as terrorism, organised crime, climate change and dangerous goods.     This Communication aims to complete the process by reforming the future organisation and human dimension of customs administrations. This implies improving the skills of customs staff and re-allocating resources efficiently and effectively.     Customs account for 13.2% of the Community budget by way of collected duties, representing more than 15 billion EUR per year. Sourcing of goods and materials has become global, and concepts such as just-in time delivery have raised expectations for economic operators of less intrusive customs controls.     Customs not only support legitimate trade and enhance competitiveness, but also play a key role in ensuring the correct payment of duties and taxes, combating counterfeiting and piracy, supporting the fight against fraud, organised crime, drugs and terrorism, implementing trade policy measures and protecting the environment and citizens against all manner of hazardous goods.     Modernisation of the legal and technological environment in customs includes the following:     the amended Community Customs Code, which has enabled European Union (EU) customs authorities to implement some of the most advanced security requirements in the world;     the Modernised Customs Code, which will simplify customs and trade tasks to make them more efficient and cost-effective;     the Electronic Customs Decision, which sets out the basic framework and major deadlines for the electronic customs project and provides a basis for the Commission, Member States and economic operators to plan their own resources;     the further development of pan-European electronic customs systems, which will help create a robust chain of communication between customs authorities throughout the Community, customs and other public authorities operating at the border, and public authorities and traders;     the proposal to amend the mutual administrative assistance provisions in customs matters would streamline and improve current IT systems to enhance capacity in the fight against fraud in the customs sector.     The new strategic framework aims to transforming customs into a modern and responsive partner to trade, whilst protecting fiscal, safety and security interests. EU customs must fulfil the following objectives:       Protection:        Customs services need to ensure protection of society as well as financial interests of the Community. Customs shall reinforce the fight against fraud, organised crime, drugs and terrorism as well as against the spread of illicit, dangerous or counterfeited and pirated goods. This should be achieved by further developing effective risk assessment and using mutual administrative assistance to ensure proper application of the law in customs-related matters.        Competitiveness:        Customs authorities can support the competitiveness of European businesses by modernising and harmonising working methods (e.g. using systems-based approaches) as well as by creating a paperless customs environment (implementing electronic customs). In this respect the Commission recommends EU customs services to take a pro-active stance in endorsing international standards such as those developed by the World Customs Organisation (WCO) and developing new EU standards, which could serve as a model worldwide.        Facilitation of legitimate business:        Overall customs need to work at improving their control systems, in order to reduce administrative burden and interference in the flow of goods to the minimum necessary to ensure security objectives. Customs can also support legitimate economic operators by providing facilitations with a view to reducing compliance costs.        Control:        Customs services can manage and control supply chains used for international movement by improving and strengthening effective checks, as well as correctly and consistently implementing Community and national legislation relating to the control and movement of goods. Furthermore effective and systematic enhancement of sharing of risk information needs to be enhanced as well as establishing end-to-end control and management in the entire supply chain.        Cooperation:        The customs authorities of the Member States, the government agencies and the business community continue to cooperate closely in achieving the common objectives of protecting citizens as well as the financial interests of the Community. Customs shall take a leading role in developing new mechanisms of coordination between border-related agencies (development of Single Window). Also the co-operation with business should be enhanced and the international cooperation and mutual administrative assistance should be reinforced.        New working methods and competences:        Customs services need to continuously develop and strategically invest in the skills, competences and resources, which can maintain customs efficiency and effectiveness. A structured approach is the first step ensuring a synchronised and harmonised method throughout the 27 Member States for achieving the strategic objectives.The above-mentioned objectives will be incorporated into a multi-annual strategic plan. This plan will be elaborated in detail in a comprehensive implementation plan which will represent a tool for planning specific actions and projects. These documents will provide a clear direction for customs services’ operations in 2013 – 2019. With the approval of the strategic framework all systems of data exchange and databases, including those dedicated to the fight against fraud, should be interoperable and operate complementarily.

   Framework of cooperation in higher education, training and youth with Canada     Framework of cooperation in higher education, training and youth with Canada     The main objective of this framework of cooperation is to renew, reinforce and extend the programme of cooperation which already exists between the European Community and Canada in the field of higher education and vocational training, in particular by adding measures concerning youth. The aim is to consolidate academic cooperation and transatlantic exchanges between citizens.     ACT     Council Decision       2006/964/EC      of 18 December 2006 on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Government of Canada establishing a framework for cooperation in higher education, training and youth.     SUMMARY     This eight-year agreement forms part of relations between the European Union (EU) and Canada. The partners plan to boost their cooperation in the areas of higher education, vocational training and youth.     The Commission will grant a budget of around EUR 18 million to the cooperation programme in order to support some 210 projects and the involvement of 4 430 European and Canadian citizens in mobility activities during the period of the new agreement.     New and innovative joint studies and new training programmes will be launched, exchanges of students, teachers and other professionals encouraged and collaboration between youth organisations promoted.      OBJECTIVES OF THE AGREEMENT      This agreement has general, specific and operational objectives.     The       general objectives      are to promote mutual understanding between the populations of the two partners, in particular by way of their respective languages, cultures and institutions, and to improve the quality of human resources in order to meet the challenges of a knowledge-based global economy.     The       specific objectives      are to:      step up cooperation between the European Community and Canada in higher education, training and youth;       contribute to transatlantic exchanges between EU and Canadian citizens;       contribute to the development of higher education and training institutions, as well as youth organisations;       consolidate partnerships between those involved in higher education, training and youth work in the EU and Canada;       support the professional development of individuals while achieving the general objectives of the agreement;       increase dialogue and exchanges on youth policy and youth work.      The       operational objectives      are to:      support collaboration between higher education and training institutions with a view to promoting joint study programmes and mobility of students;       improve the quality of transatlantic student mobility by promoting transparency, the mutual recognition of qualifications and periods of study and training, and the portability of credits;       support collaboration among public and private organisations active in the areas of higher education, training and youth with a view to encouraging discussion and the exchange of experiences;       support transatlantic mobility of professionals with a view to improving mutual understanding of issues relevant to EU/Canada relations;       support collaboration among youth organisations as well as youth workers and others involved in this field with a view to promoting exchanges of good practices and developing networks.       ACTIONS      Three types of action are planned in the new agreement to achieve these objectives: projects carried out by joint consortia, joint activities in favour of young people and complementary actions.      Joint consortia projects      These projects       *      are intended for higher education and training institutions.     They support multilateral partnerships between institutions in at least two Member States of the EU and at least two Canadian provinces or territories in order to set up joint study programmes.     In principle, these projects should normally involve transatlantic mobility of students in the framework of joint study programmes, with a goal of parity in the flows in each direction, and should provide for mutual credit recognition and linguistic and cultural preparation.     Financial support for student mobility may also be granted to joint consortia of higher education and vocational training institutions that have a proven track record of excellence in the implementation of joint projects funded by the two partners.      Joint activities in favour of young people      This action concerns youth organisations, youth leaders and other actors in this sector.     The activities may include seminars, training courses and work observation visits. They will relate to, amongst others, the following subjects:      citizens' rights;       cultural diversity;       social or voluntary work;       the recognition of non-formal and informal training.       Complementary actions      The agreement provides for three complementary actions:       policy-orientated measures        . The target public of this action is organisations involved in higher education, training and youth. Activities under this category include studies, conferences, seminars, working groups and comparative assessments. They will touch on questions relating to higher education, vocational training and youth, promoting dialogue on the recognition of qualifications and the portability of credits within the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS);        mobility grants        . The action concerns professionals, including those in training, who want to study or follow training programmes in sectors with particular relevance to relations between the two partners;       an         alumni association        . This action concerns students who have participated in exchanges organised by the joint consortia in the areas of higher education and vocational training. The association may be managed by one or more organisations appointed by the parties.       MANAGING THE FRAMEWORK OF COOPERATION      The agreement creates a joint committee comprising representatives from each party. It meets every two years, alternately in the EU and in Canada. Its decisions are reached by consensus, and it has the following functions:      reviewing the cooperation envisaged under the agreement;       presenting to the parties the level, status and effectiveness of the cooperation under the agreement;       sharing information on recent developments, policies, new trends or innovative practices related to higher education, training and youth.      The cooperation will be monitored and evaluated in order to fine-tune the cooperation activities, if necessary, in line with any new needs.     Financing will be on the basis of an overall matching of funds between the partners. Moreover, the European Community will provide support to the European Community project partners, and Canada will support the Canadian partners.      BACKGROUND      The EU and Canada have had a cooperation programme in higher education and vocational training since 1995. The aim of this programme is to create joint study programmes and to set up exchanges of students over a wide range of disciplines.     The agreement between the European Community and the Government of Canada setting up a programme of cooperation in the field of higher education and training was renewed in       2001      for five years (2000-2005). This agreement renews it for a further period of eight years and adds to it cooperation in the field of youth.       Key terms used in the act         Consortium: collaboration between several parties in a joint project or programme with the aim of achieving a result.

   The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia – Environment     The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia – Environment     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM(2011) 666      final – SEC(2011) 1230 - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was granted candidate country status for European Union (EU) membership in 2005. The Accession Partnership, adopted by the Council in 2008, supports the country’s preparations in view of its future membership and the alignment of its legislation with the Community       acquis      . In 2008, the accession negotiations had not yet been opened, as some progress still needed to be made on the objectives and conditions set out in the partnership.     The       2011 Report      from the European Commission highlights progress concerning alignment with the       acquis      on environmental policy matters. However, it regrets to report weaknesses with regard to climate change matters.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission’s words)      European environment policy aims to promote sustainable development and protect the environment for present and future generations. It is based on the integration of environmental protection into other European policies, preventive action, the polluter pays principle, fighting environmental damage at source and shared responsibility. The       acquis      comprises over 200 legal acts covering horizontal legislation, water and air pollution, management of waste and chemicals, biotechnology, nature protection, industrial pollution and risk management, and noise.     Ensuring compliance with the       acquis      requires significant investment, but also brings significant benefits for public health and reduces costly damage to forests, buildings, landscapes and fisheries. A strong and well-equipped administration at national, regional and local level is imperative for the application and enforcement of the environment       acquis      .      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      Some progress can be reported in the field of the       environment      , especially as regards transposing the EU       acquis      into national legislation and in ratifying multilateral environmental agreements. Significant efforts to implement the national legislation are required especially in the areas of water management and industrial pollution control.     Regarding       climate change       ,      little progress has been made on aligning with and implementing the EU climate change       acquis      . Further efforts are required to strengthen institutional capacities and inter-institutional cooperation.     RELATED ACTS      Commission Report [         COM(2010) 660        final – SEC(2010) 1327 - Not published in the Official Journal].      The       2010 Report      highlights that the level of preparedness of the country remains limited, even though progress has been made in the areas of air quality and waste management. The state of progress remains inadequate concerning adapting to climate change, nature protection, industrial pollution and risk management.      Commission Report [         COM(2009) 533        final – SEC(2009) 1334 – Not published in the Official Journal].       Commission Report [         COM(2008) 674        – SEC(2008) 2699 final – Not published in the Official Journal].      In its 2008 report, the Commission outlined the limited progress made on the protection and monitoring of the environment. The legislative framework had to be developed with particular attention paid to horizontal environmental legislation and to waste management. The planned investments were deemed to be insufficient to adequately prepare the country for environmental challenges. The country had not drafted a strategy for adopting and implementing the       Community acquis      .

act   Council Decision  2007/198/Euratom  of 27 March 2007 establishing the European joint undertaking for ITER and the development of fusion energy and conferring advantages upon it   summary   A large-scale international experiment, known as  ITER  , has been set up to prove the viability of  nuclear fusion  as an energy source. The European Union (EU) has created a joint undertaking for ITER and the development of fusion energy (F4E) in order to manage the EU’s contribution to ITER.   what does the decision do  It sets up a joint undertaking for ITER and F4E for a period of 35 years starting on 19 April 2007. F4E’s seat is in Barcelona, Spain.  F4E’s members are the  European Atomic Energy Community  (Euratom), represented by the European Commission, the 28 EU countries (   1   ) and Switzerland, which has concluded cooperation agreements with Euratom in the field of controlled nuclear fusion.   Objectives   These are:   to provide Euratom’s contribution to the ITER international fusion energy organisation and to  ‘Broader Approach’  activities with Japan for the rapid realisation of fusion energy as well as to prepare and coordinate a programme of activities in preparation for the construction of a  demonstration fusion reactor  and related facilities including the  international fusion materials irradiation facility  .   In addition to its other activities, the main tasks of the joint undertaking are:   to oversee the preparation of the site for the ITER project;   to provide the ITER organisation with material, financial and human resources;   to coordinate scientific and technological research and development activities in the field of fusion; and   to act as an interface with the ITER organisation.    Budget   Euratom’s contribution to F4E for the 2014-2020 period is set at €2 915 million.  F4E’s indicative financial resources for the 2007-2041 period are estimated to amount to €9 653 million, with a contribution from Euratom of €7 649 million (subject to a maximum of 15 % for administrative costs).   Structure   F4E has legal personality.  F4E has the following.   A  governing board  , comprising representatives of F4E members. It is assisted by:   the bureau;   the  Administration and Management Committee  ;   the  Procurement and Contracts Committee  ;   the  technical advisory panel  ; and   the  Audit Committee  .     The board is responsible for the supervision of F4E in the implementation of its activities.   A  director  , who is responsible for representing F4E and the day-to-day running of the organisation, including signing contracts.    Liability and jurisdiction   F4E’s contractual liability is governed by the contract in question and the law applicable to it.  The  Court of Justice of the EU  has jurisdiction in actions and appeals brought against F4E.   background   Fusion energy, together with renewable energy sources and  fission energy  , is one of the three alternatives to fossil fuels. It is by far the most widespread in the universe - it is the source of energy radiated by the sun and other stars - but the least developed on earth of these three non-fossil energy sources.  The joint European torus (  JET  ) project, established in 1978, contributed to advanced research in the field of fusion energy for several years. From 1988, the development of the ITER project represented a new stage in the field of fusion. This culminated, in 2001, in a detailed design for a research facility aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of fusion as an energy source from which the EU could derive significant benefit, in particular in the context of ensuring the security and diversity of its long-term energy supply.

summary of   Directive 2001/23/EC - on the safeguarding of employees' rights when the ownership of a company or business is transferred   summary    what does this directive do  It sets out the EU-wide rights of employees when there is transfer of ownership of a company or business in which they work, as well as the obligations of the transferor and transferee.   key points    Scope   The Directive applies to all types of employment relationships regardless of:        —     the number of working hours, performed or to be performed            —     the type of employment contract (undetermined, fixed-duration, or temporary).      It applies to all companies, public or private, which are engaged in economic activities whether or not they are operating for profit.   Transfer of ownership         —     the transfer of ownership may be the result of a legal transfer or merger,            —     the person or company receiving the transfer becomes the employer of the company transferred to them.       Transfer of employment relationships         —     The transfer of a company is  not a ground for dismissal  . Dismissal may only take place for economic, technical or organisational reasons.            —     Employees maintain their rights and obligations, as set out in an existing employment contract or relationship, when ownership is transferred.            —     The terms and conditions for employees of a  collective agreement  with the transferred company are maintained for its duration. However, this period may be limited by national governments but  not to less than one year  .            —     Employees' rights and obligations under the complementary  social protection schemes  are  not transferred  . However, national governments may take measures to protect the rights to retirement benefits acquired under these schemes.            —     Employees do not keep their rights and obligations when the transfer is undertaken as part of  insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings  . National governments may take action to prevent the misuse of insolvency proceedings to deprive employees of their rights.       Employee representatives         —     Employee representatives must continue to carry out their role during a transfer until their reappointment is possible. Employees must continue to be represented, including in the case of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings.            —     Representatives must be consulted before measures concerning employees are adopted.            —     Both the former and new employer must inform employees or their representatives in good time, of:        —     the date or proposed date of the transfer             —     the reasons for the transfer             —     the legal, economic and social implications of the transfer for the employees             —     any measures envisaged in relation to the employees.                 —     If an arbitration board exists in the EU country concerned, these information and consultation requirements may be restricted to cases where the transfer disadvantages a considerable number of employees.      background    Working conditions - transfer of undertakings  .   act   Council Directive  2001/23/EC  of 12 March 2001 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of undertakings or businesses   REFERENCES           Act     Entry into force     Deadline for transposition in the Member States     Official Journal       Council Directive  2001/23/EC      11.4.2001     16.2.1979      OJ L 82, 22.3.2001, pp. 16–20        Successive amendments and changes to Directive  2001/23/EC  have been incorporated in the original text.

Regulation No  3577/92/EEC  deals specifically with freedom to provide services in sea transport within EU countries (‘maritime cabotage’  *  ).   Unfair pricing in maritime transport    Regulation No 4057/86:    authorises the EU to apply  redressive duties  in order to protect shipowners in EU countries from unfair pricing practices on the part of non-EU shipowners. These redressive duties can be imposed after an investigation which demonstrates that injury has been caused by unfair pricing and that the interests of the EU make intervention necessary;   concerning the  examination of injury  , lays down the appropriate factors or indicators to be taken into consideration, e.g. a reduction in the shipowner’s market share or profits, or the effect on employment;   lays down a  procedure  for complaints, consultations and subsequent investigations.    Free access to ocean trades    Regulation No 4058/86:    applies when action by a non-EU country or by its agents  restricts free access  to the transport of liner cargoes, bulk cargoes or other cargoes by shipping companies of EU countries or by ships registered in an EU country (except where such action is taken in conformity with the  United Nations liner code  );   allows for  coordinated action by the EU  following a request made by an EU country to the  European Commission  . Such action might include diplomatic representation to non-EU countries and countermeasures directed at the shipping companies concerned;   permits similar coordinated action to be taken at the request of another country belonging to the  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  with which a  reciprocal arrangement  has been concluded.    Competition rules   General EU competition laws laid down in  Regulation (EC) No 1/2003  also apply to the EU maritime transport sector. However, in accordance with  Council Regulation (EC) No 246/2009  , the Commission may make exceptions for certain types of cooperation between liner shipping  *  companies (consortia  *  ). The Commission accordingly adopted  Regulation (EC) No 906/2009  , which allows these exceptions, and extended it until 25 April 2020 by Regulation (EU) No  697/2014  .   from when do the regulations apply   Council Regulation (EEC) No 4055/86 has applied since 1 January 1987.   Council Regulations (EEC) No 4057/86 and 4058/86 have applied since 1 July 1987.   Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 has applied since 1 May 2004.

   Action Plan for Better Regulation     Action Plan for Better Regulation     Regulatory simplification requires a strong political commitment from all the European institutions and the Member States throughout the legislative process. This Communication puts forward a number of actions, in the long term allowing the creation of a new legislative culture based on the "better regulation" principle.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 5 June 2002, Action Plan "Simplifying and improving the regulatory environment" [       COM(2002) 278      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The purpose of this Communication is to improve the regulatory environment. Following consultations, the Commission noted the need for better regulation throughout the legislative process: from preparation of the proposal by the Commission to implementation by the Member States. This Action Plan focuses on the responsibilities of each party concerned during the legislative process. It aims to enable all the institutions and Member States to produce better laws.      Actions to be implemented by the Commission      First of all, the Commission intends to improve the quality of the legislative proposals through a number of actions, such as:       establishing minimum standards of consultation by the end of 2002        : one of the standards envisaged by the Commission is a minimum duration of six weeks for consultations and the creation of a single access point showing the list of consultations in progress;        developing an instrument to assess the impact of major legislative and policy initiatives        : the impact assessments will make it possible to decide whether or not legislation should be passed at Community level. They will make it easier to identify the most appropriate legislative or non-legislative instrument;        expanding the explanatory memoranda accompanying legislative proposals        on the basis of five criteria: for each legislative proposal, the Commission will present the consultations held and results obtained, the impact assessments, the reasons for choosing the instrument and, lastly, the budgetary implications of the proposal;        including a review clause in legislative acts        , or even a revision clause, in the Commission's legislative proposals, which will make it possible to ensure that legislation is kept up to date and that legal certainty for users is preserved. These review clauses will be particularly beneficial in the fields subject to rapid technological change.      Secondly, the Commission undertakes to monitor the adoption and application of legislative acts more closely by:      giving the European Parliament and Council greater encouragement to come to an agreement quickly;       calling on the Council to vote by qualified majority wherever provision is made for this in order to accelerate the procedure;       making greater use of the opportunities to withdraw its proposals, particularly if a proposal is pending and has not been discussed for several years by the Council and the European Parliament. It will also withdraw its proposals if the amendments introduced by the European Parliament and/or the Council change the proposal disproportionately. Lastly, it stresses that proposals will be withdrawn under the process of negotiation and the political compromises achieved by the institutions;       following up infringements. It plans in particular to lay down criteria which will be used to establish priorities for examining possible breaches of Community law, for example the quality of transposition of the directives or the serious effects on Community interest. The Commission will also reinforce its checks on transposition.      Lastly, the Commission will ensure the general coordination and implementation of this Action Plan by setting up an internal network for "better lawmaking". This network will involve all the Directorates-General and will be coordinated by the Secretariat-General. It will have the following mandate:      to monitor compliance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality;       to coordinate the preparation of the annual assessment of the quality of legislation and of national reports;       to ensure that the Commission adopts a consistent position within the interinstitutional network and in its relations with the Member States.       Action proposed to the European Parliament and the Council      The Commission calls upon the Parliament and Council to commit to improving legislative quality, for example by concluding an inter-institutional agreement by the end of 2002. First of all, the Commission proposes that the institutions make more appropriate use of legislative instruments. This would be achieved by:       reverting to the original definitions of the directive and regulation laid down in the Treaty        : regulations must be used only for action requiring uniform application in the Member States. As far as possible, the use of directives must be limited to the establishment of a general framework;        using certain alternatives to legislation, where appropriate        , such as self-regulation, sectoral voluntary agreements or the open coordination method. The Commission will propose more frequent use of co-regulation to the legislator. This allows the parties concerned to adopt implementing measures in line with the objectives laid down by the legislator. The legislator can then judge whether the use of this instrument is appropriate;        the Commission's undertaking to avoid making its legislative proposals unwieldy        .      The European Parliament and the Council are asked to support the Commission in its plans to simplify and reduce the volume of Community legislation. The institutions should therefore draw up a simplification programme. The Commission suggests that the European Parliament and the Council create structures specifically responsible for legislative simplification. It would be a good idea to have an inter-institutional agreement on the subject. The European Parliament and the Council are called upon to support the codification programme by adopting codification proposals under accelerated procedures.     The European Union institutions are responsible for the quality of the legislation adopted. Some amendments can alter the quality of the act because they have been drafted complicatedly or they are too precise or not precise enough. The introduction of a period during which the act can be reread by lawyer-linguists would make it possible to improve quality and consistency before final adoption. The Commission proposes that the European Parliament and the Council carry out impact assessments of the substantial amendments which they introduce at first reading.      Action concerning the Member States      The Member States should also be committed to improving and simplifying the regulatory environment. The Commission therefore recommends that the Member States:      transpose Community acts into national legislation faithfully and within the set deadlines;       involve the national, regional and local authorities responsible for transposing and applying Community acts as early as possible in the legislative process;       appoint a correspondent responsible for coordinating the transposition and application of Community acts.      The Commission proposes that the Member States take specific action, including:      electronic notification of national transposing measures, using a standard form. The Member States should at the same time submit concordance tables which can be used to compare the transposing measures with the original Community act;       consultations and impact assessments of any supplementary provisions added to legislative acts at the time of transposition.       Developing a common legislative culture within the Union      In order to successfully implement this Action Plan, the objective of improving regulations must be applied to the entire legislative cycle, from the drafting of the proposal to its adoption by the legislator to its application by the Member States. The development of a common legislative culture will ultimately benefit European citizens. The Commission therefore proposes the following actions:       the creation of a legislative network        on two levels: on the one hand, between the Community institutions and, on the other, between the institutions and the Member States. The Commission proposes that the Community institutions set up a permanent mechanism, the "Better regulation" internal network, with the aim of implementing the Action Plan. In order to improve cooperation between the Community institutions and the Member States, the Commission intends to appoint "transposition and application" correspondents;        the annual assessment of the quality of legislation        : the Commission will assess the implementation of the Action Plan on a yearly basis and will draw up national reports on a particular group of countries in turn;        public access to legislation        must be developed, in particular by expanding public access to Eur-Lex, developing Internet forums and mobilising the traditional info-centres and contact points for Community information.      RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission of 6 June 2002 - "European Governance: better lawmaking" [         COM(2002) 0275        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      This Communication complements the Action Plan "Simplifying and improving the regulatory environment". It aims to improve implementation by the EU through a number of initiatives, including:       clarification of executive responsibilities        : the Commission proposes clarifying the rules governing comitology, in particular through the precise definition of each institution's remit. The European Parliament should be involved in comitology, particularly for the implementation of decisions under the codecision procedure;        a framework for the creation of European agencies        : the Commission will submit to the Parliament and the Council the terms of an interinstitutional agreement on the subject;        consideration of the regional, urban and local contexts        : regional and local authorities and the Member States will have the opportunity to conclude pilot contracts with the Commission with a view to achieving the Community's sustainable development objectives;        a new approach to vetting the application of the law        : the Commission will pay closer attention to delays in the implementation of national application measures.      Lastly, this Communication reaffirms the importance of the Community method as a basis for building the European Union. The reforms of governance, "a quiet revolution in terms of the way we act", require the institutions to consolidate and clarify the sharing of their powers.      Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 11 February 2003 - "Updating and simplifying the Community acquis" [         COM(2003) 71        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      This Communication follows on from the Action Plan "Simplifying and improving the regulatory environment". Since the Community was established, the Community acquis has never undergone a full examination. The Commission proposes a Framework for Action aimed at simplifying the Community acquis and sets the following six objectives:      simplify the acquis;       consolidation of the acquis must be completed and kept rigorously up to date;       codification;       reviewing the organisation and presentation of the acquis;       ensure transparency and effective monitoring at political and technical level;       establish an effective implementation strategy.

summary of   Regulation (EU) No 649/2012 — export and import of hazardous chemicals   what is the aim of the regulation   It implements in the EU the  Rotterdam Convention  on import and export procedures for hazardous chemicals.   It ensures that countries receiving certain chemicals from the EU are:   informed about the export;   asked whether they agree to the export;   informed about the safe handling of chemicals to protect human health and the environment from potential harm.     key points    Scope    The regulation applies to:   hazardous chemicals listed under the Rotterdam Convention;   chemicals that are banned or severely restricted within the EU;   chemicals that are exported.     It does not cover:   narcotics;   radioactive materials;   waste;   chemical weapons;   food and food additives;   feed;   genetically-modified organisms and some medicines; and   chemicals exported for research or analysis in quantities unlikely to affect human health or the environment.     The regulation requires proper labelling and packaging of chemicals when they are exported from an EU country.   186 chemicals (pesticides and industrial chemicals) are listed in Annex I and are subject to certain obligations when exported. Hazardous chemicals can either be exported on their own or blended into a mixture or article.   This regulation replaces Regulation (EC) No  689/2008  and updates some procedures and terminology that needed to be brought into line with other EU rules. In addition, it involves the  European Chemicals Agency  in implementing the legal requirements.    How it works    The regulation implements the two main procedures of the Convention, i.e. the  Prior Informed Consent Procedure (PIC)  and  Information Exchange  . It includes export notification in order to inform countries on the trade in certain chemicals, but it also goes further than the Convention, for example, by applying the procedures to exports to all countries, irrespective of whether they are parties to the Convention.   The PIC allows importing parties to the Convention to inform exporting parties on whether they agree to imports of the hazardous chemicals listed in the Convention. The regulation requires the explicit consent of the importing country for more chemicals than those listed in the Convention.   Each chemical listed in the Convention has a  decision guidance document  to help governments make a more informed decision. All parties are required to take a decision on allowing imports — known as an  import response  — and the regulation ensures that  import responses are respected for EU exports  .   Under the Information Exchange mechanism, each party must notify the Convention’s  Secretariat  when  banning a chemical  , and must notify the importing parties upon the export of such chemical. The regulation establishes the export notification procedure for EU exports of such chemicals to all importing countries.   All chemicals when exported must be  labelled and packed  according to certain standards and accompanied  by basic safety information  on a safety data sheet.   Each EU country must set up a  designated national authority  to be responsible for implementing the regulation.   The  European Commission  and EU countries share responsibility within the Convention, in particular in regard to:   technical assistance;   information-sharing; and   matters relating to dispute settlement.     from when does the regulation apply  The Regulation (EU) No  649/2012  is the  recast  version of Regulation (EC) No  689/2008  and its subsequent amendments. It has applied since 1 March 2014.   background   For more information, see:    Trade of Dangerous Chemicals  (  European Commission  )    Prior Informed Consent Regulation  (  European Chemicals Agency  ).
   Driver-perceived noise level of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors     Driver-perceived noise level of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors     Noise emissions produced by tractors must be limited so as not to damage the health and safety of tractor drivers. This Directive establishes rules relating to noise levels.     ACT     Directive       2009/76/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 relating to the driver-perceived noise level of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors (Codified version) (Text with EEA relevance).     SUMMARY     This Directive establishes technical prescriptions concerning the design and construction of agricultural and forestry tractors, as regards driver-perceived noise levels.      Types of vehicle covered by the Directive      This Directive applies to agricultural or forestry tractors which are equipped with pneumatic tyres and have a maximum design speed of between 6 and 40 km/h.     These vehicles have the following characteristics:      they are fitted with wheels or endless tracks;       they have at least two axles;       they may be equipped to carry a load and passengers.      Tractors are essentially used to tow, push, carry or power certain tools, machinery or trailers intended for agricultural or forestry use.      Acceptable noise levels and method of measurement      The driver-perceived noise level must not exceed 90 (Annex I) or 86 decibels (Annex II).     Measurements of noise levels shall be taken under specific conditions, including the following:      the tractor must be empty;       the tyres must be inflated to the air pressure recommended by the tractor manufacturer;       extra equipment may not be in operation when measurements are being taken;       the driver-perceived ambient noise level due to the wind or other sources of noise must be at least 10 decibels below the noise level of the tractor;       the microphone must be located 250 mm to the side of the centre plane of the seat.       EC type-approval procedure      Member States may refuse to grant EC type-approval or national type-approval to vehicles which do not comply with the prescriptions of this Directive.      Context      This Directive repeals       Directive 77/311/EC      .

act   Council Decision 2012/738/EU on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Food Assistance Convention.   summary    What's the issue?   The  Food Assistance Convention  , the most recent of a series of multilateral agreements between donors, seeks to provide appropriate and effective food and nutrition assistance to vulnerable populations in eligible countries, based on  identified needs  .   The aim of the Convention is to:    save lives   reduce hunger   improve  food security  *   improve the quality of nutrition of the most vulnerable populations in eligible countries.   In line with the EU's humanitarian food assistance policy, the Convention aims to improve vulnerable populations' access to and consumption of  adequate, safe and nutritious food  on the basis of proper  needs analysis  .   What has changed?   Under the Convention, parties share information, cooperate, and liaise with one another. It also serves as a forum for discussion allowing them to exchange information with other interested parties about issues - e.g. lessons learnt in the running of a given type of programme - to help ensure that their resources are used to maximum effect.   Operation:  Each party agrees to make a minimum annual commitment of food assistance, expressed in terms of value or quantity. This commitment should be made in the form of a grant, whenever possible.  It is clearly stipulated that food assistance may not be tied in any way, to commercial exports of agricultural products or other goods and services to recipient countries.  Contributions may be provided:   bilaterally,   through intergovernmental or other international organisations, or   through other food assistance partners.    Eligible countries  include:   those on the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee (DAC) list of  official development assistance recipients  , or   any other country identified in the Rules of Procedure and Implementation.    Background:  the European Union is a party to the International Grains Agreement comprising 2 distinct legal instruments: the  Grains Trade Convention  and the  Food Assistance Convention  . Other signatories include the US, Australia, Canada, Japan and Switzerland .

   Provisions of the TWF directive on televised advertising (interpretative communication)     Provisions of the TWF directive on televised advertising (interpretative communication)     The objective of this communication is to clarify the way in which the "television without frontiers" (TWF) Directive should be applied to new advertising techniques (split-screen advertising, interactive advertising, product placement). This interpretative communication on televised advertising is part of the framework for amending the TWF Directive.     ACT     Commission interpretative communication of 23 April 2004 on certain aspects of the provisions on televised advertising in the "Television without frontiers" Directive [C (2004) 1450 - Official Journal C 102 of 28.04.2004].     SUMMARY      Objective      The objective of this interpretative communication is to specify how the provisions on certain commercial practices and new advertising techniques in the TWF Directive should be applied. It seeks to clarify some key rules and increase legal certainty for economic operators.     This communication focuses on existing rules; it does not lay down any new ones.      Compatibility of new advertising techniques      The communication shows that the new forms and techniques in advertising are not per se incompatible with the Directive, provided their use does not undermine the objectives of general interest pursued by the Directive:      the right of viewers to a clear-cut separation of advertising from editorial content (in particular by acoustic or optical means);       the right of viewers to protection against excessive advertising of all kinds;       the right of rights holders to have the integrity of their audiovisual works respected.      The Commission sets out to clarify how the TWF Directive should be applied to certain advertising practices (e.g. mini-spots, telepromotions) and to new advertising techniques (split-screen advertising, virtual advertising and interactive advertising).      Mini-spots      The advertising practice of using mini-spots consists of broadcasting an extremely short advertising spot when an incident occurs during a programme broadcast. This practice has emerged particularly in connection with the transmission of football matches.     The Commission reminds national authorities that they must ensure that the broadcast of mini-spots does not undermine the principles of the TWF Directive with regard to the form and presentation of televised advertising. These advertising messages must be readily recognisable as such and kept separate from other parts of the programme. Furthermore, the broadcast of mini-spots must remain the exception.      Telepromotions      Telepromotions are a form of television advertising based on the interruption of studio programmes (especially game shows) by slots devoted to the presentation of products or services. During telepromotions, the programme presenters momentarily swap their role in the games in progress for one as "promoters" of the goods or services presented.     The Commission considers that telepromotions are compatible with the Directive, provided they are kept quite separate from other parts of the programme service. Telepromotion spots fall under the daily limits set by the Directive (the proportion of telepromotion spots may not exceed 20% of the daily transmission time).      Split screen      Split-screen advertising involves transmitting editorial content and advertising content simultaneously or in parallel. For example, one or more advertising spots appear in a window during the transmission of a programme in such a way that two separate images are visible on the screen. This technique enables the viewer to continue to watch the editorial programme during the transmission of an advertising spot.     The Commission explains that split-screen advertising may be superimposed during programmes, provided there is a period of 20 minutes between each advertising announcement. Furthermore, the superimposition of split-screen spots must comply with the Directive provisions on hourly and daily limits for broadcasting advertising spots.      Interactive advertising      Interactive advertising allows viewers to supply information directly to the broadcaster via a return path, or to interactively explore a chosen environment for as long as they wish.     When it comes to applying the TWF Directive to this advertising technique, the Commission distinguishes between two different scenarios.     As long as the viewer has not entered the interactive environment, the context is one of a linear broadcast of television programmes governed by the TWF Directive. This means that the provisions of the Directive apply with respect to the obligation to keep advertising separate from editorial content, to advertising content and to the protection of human dignity and of minors.     However, when the viewer chooses to enter the interactive environment voluntarily, he or she leaves the linear environment governed by the TWF Directive and enters an interactive electronic commerce environment. The messages aimed at him or her now are governed by the       electronic commerce      Directive.     Regardless of the broadcasting method used (linear or interactive), advertising announcements must observe the Recommendation on the       protection of minors and of human dignity      .      Virtual advertising      Virtual advertising involves using virtual techniques for inserting advertisements during broadcasts of sporting events, in particular, by replacing existing advertising boards on the field or by superimposing new images.     The Commission emphasises that virtual advertising may be used to replace the actual messages advertised on billboards in sports arenas and stadiums. However, virtual advertising messages must not be more visible or conspicuous than those that normally appear on the billboards in question.      Background      This communication follows on from the public consultation launched in 2003 as part of the review of the TWF Directive. The consultation showed that there was a need to reconsider how the Directive should be applied in light of the changes that had occurred in the audiovisual world (particularly with regard to advertising) since the Directive had been adopted in 1989.     On the basis of this consultation, the Commission stated in a communication of 15 December 2003 on       The Future of European Regulatory Audiovisual Policy      that it intended to adopt an interpretative communication on the provisions in the TWF Directive which dealt with televised advertising.     The Directive on the provision of audiovisual media services amending the       TWF Directive      entered into force on 18 December 2007.

   Reporting formalities for ships     Reporting formalities for ships     SUMMARY OF:      Directive 2010/65/EU on reporting formalities for ships arriving in and/or departing from EU ports      WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?      It aims to reduce the amount of reporting formalities for ships arriving in and/or departing from EU ports so as to facilitate maritime transport.       It has been amended by Directive (EU)         2017/2109        on the         registration of persons on board passenger ships        and Directive (EU)         2019/883        on         port reception facilities for the delivery of waste from ships        .      KEY POINTS      Scope      This directive applies to the reporting formalities applicable to maritime transport for ships arriving in and ships departing from ports in EU countries.     EU countries must ensure that the reporting formalities at their ports are requested in a harmonised and coordinated manner. The master, or any other person duly authorised by the operator of the ship, must provide the competent national authority with notification, prior to arriving in an EU port, of the information required under the reporting formalities.      Electronic transmission of data      EU countries:      had to accept the electronic submission of reporting formalities via a single window at the latest by 1 June 2015; this national single window is the place where all information is reported once and made available to various competent authorities and the EU countries;       must ensure that information received in accordance with reporting formalities is made available in their national         SafeSeaNet        systems and make available parts of such information to other EU countries via the SafeSeaNet system;       must accept         FAL        forms (         special forms        developed by the International Maritime Organization for the facilitation of international maritime traffic) for the fulfilment of reporting formalities and they were still able to accept information provided in paper format until 1 June 2015.       Exemptions      Ships which are within the scope of Directive       2002/59/EC      (see       summary      ) and which operate between ports situated in the customs territory of the EU, without coming from, calling at or heading towards a port outside the EU, are exempt from the obligation to provide the information.      Amendments       Amending Directive (EU) 2017/2109 introduced new rules which aim at digitalising the registration of persons sailing on board passengers ships. It seeks to ensure the immediate availability of the exact number of passengers and other information for the use of the search and rescue (SAR) services in the event of an accident. Under the new requirements, the number of persons on board has to be communicated by means of either the         national single windows        or, where an EU country so chooses, to the designated authority by means of the automatic identification system         *        before the ship’s departure.       Directive (EU) 2019/883 on port reception facilities for the delivery of waste from ships amends the annex to Directive 2010/65/EU regarding the information to be provided to the authorities concerning waste from ships, including residues.       Repeal      Directive 2010/65/EU is repealed by Regulation (EU)       2019/1239      on a       European Maritime Single Window environment      as of 15 August 2025. The new regulation establishes a framework for a technologically neutral and interoperable European Maritime Single Window environment (EMSWe) with harmonised interfaces to facilitate the electronic transmission of information in relation to reporting obligations for ships arriving at, staying in and departing from EU ports.     FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?     The directive has applied in the EU countries since 19 May 2012 and it had to become law in the EU countries on the same date.     BACKGROUND     For more information, see:       European Maritime Single Window environment        (         European Commission        )      Following the COVID-19 outbreak and introducing measures to cope with the impact of the crisis, the European Commission adopted:       Communication from the Commission — Guidelines on protection of health, repatriation and travel arrangements for seafarers, passengers and other persons on board ships        .      KEY TERMS      Automatic Identification System:      a maritime broadcast system, based on the transmission of very high frequency (VHF) radio signals. Ships send reports with ship identification, position, and course, as well as information on cargo. In EU, Icelandic and Norwegian waters, the exchange of AIS messages is done through the SafeSeaNet system.     MAIN DOCUMENT     Directive       2010/65/EU      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 October 2010 on reporting formalities for ships arriving in and/or departing from ports of the Member States and repealing Directive 2002/6/EC (OJ L 283, 29.10.2010, pp. 1-10)     Successive amendments to Directive 2010/65/EU have been incorporated into the original document. This       consolidated version      is of documentary value only.     RELATED DOCUMENTS     Directive (EU)       2019/883      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on port reception facilities for the delivery of waste from ships, amending Directive 2010/65/EU and repealing Directive 2000/59/EC (OJ L 151, 7.6.2019, pp. 116-142)     Regulation (EU)       2019/1239      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 establishing a European Maritime Single Window environment and repealing Directive 2010/65/EU (OJ L 198, 25.7.2019, pp. 64-87)     Directive (EU)       2017/2109      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 November 2017 amending Council Directive 98/41/EC on the registration of persons sailing on board passenger ships operating to or from ports of the Member States of the Community and Directive 2010/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on reporting formalities for ships arriving in and/or departing from ports of the Member States (OJ L 315, 30.11.2017, pp. 52-60)     last update 12.01.2020  
summary of   Directive 2009/50/EC — Conditions of entry and residence of non-EU nationals for the purposes of highly-qualified employment   what is the aim of the directive   It sets out the entry and residence conditions for highly-qualified  *  non-EU nationals wishing to work in a highly-qualified job in an EU country (other than Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom (   1   )), and for their families.   It creates an EU Blue Card  *  system.   key points    Applicants for an EU Blue Card must present:   a valid work contract or binding job offer of at least 1 year, providing a salary at least 1.5 times the average gross annual salary in the EU country concerned;   documentary proof that they hold the necessary qualifications;   a valid travel document and, if required, a visa;   proof of health insurance.     EU countries may reject an application if the above conditions are not met or the documents have been acquired illegally, falsified or tampered with.   The applicant must not be a threat to public policy, security or health.   EU countries may determine the number of highly-qualified employees they admit.   Successful applicants will be issued with an EU Blue Card valid for a standard period of 1-4 years, depending on the EU country concerned, or for the duration of the work contract, if this is shorter than the standard period of validity, plus 3 months.   The application may be made by the individual and/or their employer, depending on the EU country.   For the first 2 years, EU Blue Card holders are restricted to highly-qualified jobs that meet the criteria for admission. After that they may apply on equal terms with a country’s nationals for other highly-qualified employment, depending on the EU country concerned.   EU Blue Card holders and their families can enter, re-enter and stay in the EU country that issues the card and pass through other EU countries.   EU Blue Card holders enjoy the same rights as a country’s nationals in terms of  working conditions  , education,  recognition of qualifications  ,  social security  and freedom of association. EU countries may restrict some of these, particularly educational grants and loans.   National authorities may withdraw an EU Blue Card, or refrain from renewing it, if the holder no longer meets the original conditions, has been unemployed for more than 3 months or is considered a public threat.   After 18 months’ legal residence, an EU Blue Card holder benefits from some facilitation to obtain the necessary visa to move to another EU country. Provided they again meet the admission criteria, they can be allowed to start working before a decision to grant the visa is taken, and family members can join them immediately.   The Commission reports every 3 years on how the legislation is being applied. The first  report  was published in June 2014.    Review and proposal    In 2016, the  European Commission  issued a  proposal  to repeal Directive 2009/50/EC. This stemmed from a  review  of the directive, published in parallel, which concluded that the current directive has many intrinsic weaknesses and that it is not being applied consistently across the EU. Moreover, many EU countries have  parallel rules and procedures  for the same category of highly-skilled workers. This  fragmentation   is   not efficient  , as it creates a burden for employers and applicants.  Nor is it effective  , as the numbers of permits issued to highly-skilled workers remain limited. This makes it more difficult for the EU to attract and retain the talent it needs.   The proposal seeks both to  address the shortcomings  of the previous directive and to  extend its scope  to include  beneficiaries of international protection  and  non-EU family members of EU citizens  . The proposed scheme would also replace parallel national schemes targeting the same group as the Blue Card.   The proposal also includes the following:    more flexible admission conditions  (a lower salary threshold; a lower minimum duration of 6 months for the initial contract; simpler rules for recent graduates and workers in shortage occupations; and equivalence between professional experience and formal qualifications);    simpler procedures  (faster and more flexible procedures; an optional fast-track procedure for trusted employers);    broader rights  (more flexible labour market access, including self-employed activity on the side; immediate family reunification; easier access to EU long-term residence status);    easier travel within the EU  (e.g. for short-term business trips across the EU; access to an EU Blue Card in a second EU country).     from when does the directive apply  The directive has applied since 19 June 2009. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 19 June 2011.   background   For more information, see ‘  Legal migration and Integration  ’ (European Commission).   key terms    Highly-qualified employee:  someone in paid work who has a specific skill set certified by advanced professional qualifications.   EU Blue Card:  a work and residence permit bearing the words ‘EU Blue Card’, entitling the holder to live and work in the EU country that issued it.
   Maritime safety: Erika I package     Maritime safety: Erika I package     This Communication aims to improve safety in the seaborne petroleum products trade.     ACT     Commission communication of 21 March 2000 to Parliament and the Council on the safety of the seaborne oil trade [       COM(2000) 142      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     On 12 December 1999 the oil tanker Erika broke in two 40 miles off the coast of Brittany (France). More than 10 000 tonnes of heavy fuel oil were spilt, thereby creating an ecological disaster. Pressure of public opinion prompted the Commission to propose action at Community level.     According to the Commission, this action "is designed to bring about a change in the prevailing mentality in the seaborne oil trade. More powerful incentives are needed in order to persuade the carriers, charterers, classification societies and other key bodies to give a higher profile to quality considerations. At the same time, the net should be tightened on those who pursue short-term personal financial gain at the expense of safety and the marine environment."      The seaborne petroleum products trade: state of play      Of all basic products in the world, oil occupies the leading position in the transportation stakes. The European Union (EU) occupies the number one position in the       petroleum products trade      . By way of comparison, its crude oil imports represent about 27% of total world trade, as against 25% for the United States. Close to 90% of the oil trade with the EU relies on sea transport (the rest being routed by pipeline, land transport or by inland waterway). Taking into account the forecast levels of demand for petroleum products, the deployment of oil tankers is expected to grow and grow over the years to come.     Each year, 800 million tonnes are transported to or from Community ports. About 70%       of oil tanker movements      in the Union are along the Atlantic and North Sea coasts (the remaining 30% being via the Mediterranean), thereby making these zones the most vulnerable to oil spills, as demonstrated by the sinking of the Erika and, more recently, the Prestige.     On top of that, many oil tankers cross the waters of the Union without calling at EU ports, and this represents an additional volume of traffic, and hence an additional danger. The Union's major oil ports are Rotterdam, Marseille, Le Havre, Trieste and Wilhelmshaven. The imported oil comes mainly from the Middle East and North Africa. European exports (from the North Sea oilfields) go mainly to destinations in North America.     The crude oil transport market is dominated by high-tonnage vessels (over 200 000 tonnes). However, the       vessels      used in the North Sea are more modest in size, ranging from 5 000 to 50 000 tonnes. Some 15 000 to 20 000 vessels operate in the waters of the Union each year.     In 1999 the average age of vessels making up the world oil tanker fleet was 18 years, with 41% of them more than 20 years old. The latter group represent 36% of oil tanker tonnage. In the EU, the average age of registered oil tankers in 1999 was 19.1 years. Over 45% of the European fleet is more than 20 years old. European companies frequently register their vessels under foreign flags. Thus, the flags frequently used by EU interests include those of Liberia, Panama, Cyprus, Malta and The Bahamas.     Between 1992 and 1999 the number of ships lost worldwide totalled 593, of which 77 were oil tankers. While this figure corresponds to only 13% of the number of accidents, it nevertheless represents 31% of the lost tonnage. Despite these figures, the results in terms of safety may be regarded as relatively good. The causes of       accidents      at sea can vary widely:      Accidents are often attributed to         human error        (navigation or pilotage error). Crew         training        and crew skills have been recognised as key elements in improving safety at sea. In addition,         working conditions        constitute an equally important factor, particularly as fatigue is recognised as a growing cause of accidents at sea.       There is a general correlation between the         age of vessels        and the accidents that have occurred. 60 of the 77 oil tankers lost between 1992 and 1999 were more than 20 years old.Problems associated with the         structure        (breach in the hull, corrosion, etc.),         fire        and         explosions        are among the other causes of accidents.       The         chartering practices        peculiar to the oil trade also add to the complexity of the situation. Oil companies in fact control only a quarter of the world fleet. What we are witnessing is a process of "fragmentation" among the oil tanker owners. By dispersing their fleet among single-ship companies, often taking the form of dummy companies registered in offshore financial centres, owners are able to reduce their financial risks. Consequently, it is often difficult to identify the real decision-makers and hence to determine where responsibility really lies.       The oil trade and the charter market operate in a         highly competitive atmosphere        . Finding the cheapest oil tanker carrying capacity on the market is an essential part of the operation. The volatile nature of the market is also resulting in a move-away from long-term contracts between charterers and carriers towards short-term charters (the so-called "spot market"). Prices on this market are fiercely competitive. In reality, the age of the oil tanker plays little part in the decision-making process; often it is the cheapest available tonnage offered by the oldest ships that dictates prices. It is therefore difficult to create a situation where quality pays, so much so that small operators with low overheads are winning over parts of the market at the expense of companies with well established reputations. This phenomenon poses a risk to safety.       Existing measures to ensure safety      Following several disasters (Torrey Canyon 1967, Exxon Valdez 1989), a series of conventions were drawn up under the auspices of the       International Maritime Organisation      (       IMO      ). Their aim was to combat accidental pollution (unforeseen events) and operational pollution (deliberate acts, such as the cleaning of tanks with seawater). For example, the       International MARPOL Convention      for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships was adopted in 1973.     Apart from the environmental aspect, this convention also seeks to bring about the gradual phasing-out of single hull oil tankers and their replacement by double hull tankers or tankers of equivalent design. The MARPOL Convention also provides for more rigorous checks on the state of ageing oil tankers. Down the years the IMO directives have become more and more specific, and oil tanker hulls are now subjected to much more stringent inspections than was previously the case.     Again, as a result of MARPOL, oil tankers built since 1966 have to have a double hull or be of equivalent design, while single hull oil tankers are gradually being phased out. Double hull vessels will reduce considerably the risk of pollution, particularly in incidents involving slight collisions or grounding. On 1 January 2000, double hull vessels accounted for about 20% of the world's oil tanker fleet.     Traffic separation schemes have been adopted in high-density shipping areas (e.g. one-way sea-lanes which sharply reduce the risk of head-on collisions in the Strait of Dover). In the future, navigation equipment will be more reliable and more accurate. Satellite navigation technology provides a greater degree of precision and reliability (in particular, the       Galileo      system).     At the same time, however, it has to be acknowledged that action on maritime safety under the auspices of the IMO falls short of what is needed to tackle the causes of such disasters effectively. Action by the IMO is severely handicapped by the absence of adequate control mechanisms governing the way the rules are applied throughout the world. As a result, IMO regulations are not applied everywhere with the same rigour. The evolution of maritime transport over the last few decades and, in particular, the emergence of "flags of convenience" (registration of vessels in foreign countries), some of which fail to live up to their obligations under the international conventions, is tending to aggravate this phenomenon.     It was for this reason that the European Council called on the Commission, following the 1978 Amoco Cadiz disaster, to come forward with proposals to control and reduce pollution caused by oil spills. In the event, however, little has been done. Once the "momentum" generated by an accident has subsided, Member States have tended to avoid binding measures at Community level, all the more so since unanimity used to be required for decision-taking.     It was not until the mid-1990s and the advent of qualified majority voting that the Council was able to adopt the first building blocks of a common maritime safety policy, including the organisation at Community level of stricter application of international conventions and the adoption of measures of a specifically Community nature in cases where the IMO standards were non-existent or inadequate. In the meantime, the following instruments have been enacted:     - Directive       95/21/EC      , amended by Directive 2001/106/EC on       port State control      . This Directive provides for inspections to be carried out on all vessels and includes specific requirements relating to the inspection of oil tankers.     - Council Directive       94/57/EC      , amended by Directive       2001/105/EC      . This Directive lays down common rules and standards for       ship inspection      and survey organisations and for the relevant activities of maritime administrations.     - Regulation (EC) No       2099/2002      establishing a Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (COSS) and amending the Regulations on maritime safety and the prevention of pollution from ships.     - Directive       2000/59/EC      on port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues. This Directive aims to ensure compliance with the MARPOL provisions requiring ports to provide adequate reception facilities.     The Erika disaster demonstrates, firstly, the risk presented by old ships and, secondly, the need to tighten up, on a specifically Community basis, the existing Community regulatory framework which, incidentally, Member States are not applying properly, particularly as regards the number of inspections in ports beyond the level of the IMO standards. This was also the tendency in the USA, where the regulatory framework was tightened up at federal level following the Exxon Valdez disaster.      Proposals for immediate action      The Commission is proposing a number of measures that could be taken immediately, as well as longer-term, more complex measures which will be the subject of a       second legislative package      .     With regard to the short-term regulatory measures, the Commission is presenting three sets of measures to Parliament and the Council with this communication:       Port State control        . This is a proposal to amend Directive         95/21/EC        . It is proposed to ban from all ports of the Union ships older than fifteen years that have been detained more than twice in the course of the two preceding years, on the basis of a "blacklist" which the Commission will publish every six months. In addition, inspections of all ships will have to be stepped up in line with the age of the vessel and will systematically have to target one of the ballast tanks. Ships will be required to communicate certain information before entering ports to enable inspections to be properly prepared.        Classification societies        This concerns Directive         2001/105/EC        . In the Commission's view, there needs to be stricter monitoring of the classification societies to which Member States delegate power to inspect the quality of ships. The Commission, using a simplified procedure, reserves the right to suspend or withdraw recognition from societies that fail to comply with the criteria laid down in the Directive.In addition, more stringent quality criteria must be met by the recognised organisations, including the obligation to follow certain procedures when a ship changes class, such as the transmission of the complete history file of the ship to the new classification society.        Double        -         hull oil tankers        . This is a Directive proposing to speed up the replacement of single-hull oil tankers by double-hull oil tankers following a timetable similar to that adopted in the United States (2005, 2010, 2015 depending on tonnage).      These three pieces of legislation form a single entity and apply not just to oil tankers but, in the case of the first two proposals, to any ships transporting dangerous or pollutant substances. In particular, the information gathered in the course of inspections in each port or of surveys by the classification societies will be widely publicised, notably through the Equasis database (cf. point 18.1), so that the condition of a vessel will systematically be known and individual liability will be clearly established in the event of an accident.      Proposals for future action      In a second stage, the Commission plans to make additional proposals in the following areas:       Increased transparency.        The authorities are seriously concerned at the lack of         availability of information        on matters of relevance to ship safety. While a great amount of information on ships is being collected by various bodies, it is scattered in many different places and often difficult to access, even for the maritime industry at large. Consequently, the European Commission, in cooperation with the maritime administration of France, has initiated the creation of a new ship safety database, Equasis, which will collect information relating to the safety and quality performance of ships and their operators and which will be available on the Internet.        Surveillance of shipping.        The Commission proposes improved surveillance of shipping, particularly in those areas where oil tanker traffic is most dense. In the Commission's view, the arrangements for inspection of the most dangerous ships outside territorial waters need to be examined. Indeed, there have been cases of particularly dangerous ships sailing along the coast of one or more Member States before the problem could be detected in port. Consequently, inspections in ports do not always provide an adequate solution.        Enlargement of the EU.        From the point of view of maritime safety, the accession negotiations present a challenge. If the 13 candidate countries were to join the European Union today, the average number of ships detained flying the European flag would increase to 13.26%. This high percentage is due to the below-average performance of ships flying the flag of certain candidate countries, notably Malta and Cyprus, which have the fourth and fifth largest fleets in the world. For the Commission, such a fall in the level of safety of EU shipping is unacceptable and cannot be justified on the grounds of enlargement. It is therefore essential that the candidate countries commit themselves, as soon as possible and certainly no later than the date of their accession to the Union, to the scrupulous application of the international and European maritime safety standards.        Towards a European maritime safety structure.        In its communication, the Commission reflects on the possibility of establishing a European maritime safety structure, whose prime task would be to monitor the organisation and effectiveness of national inspections in order to ensure greater uniformity.        Extending the liability of the various players in the seaborne oil trade        . The liability regime is currently governed by international conventions. The Commission intends, firstly, to seek to increase the number of collective         compensation        schemes, but also to establish the principle of liability on the part of the carrier and the owner of the cargo.      Before proposing new Community legislation in the social field in particular (training of seafarers, etc.), the Commission wishes to draw attention in this communication to the fact that several of the measures already adopted have still not been correctly implemented. Some of the texts already adopted have either not been transposed or are not being properly applied, with the result that infringement proceedings are in progress in several cases.     Furthermore, while deploring the widespread recourse to flags of convenience, the Commission would also point out that most of the vessels controlled by European companies have been flagged out to third countries for tax reasons. Having said that, the Commission considers that it should be a condition of the accession negotiations with       Cyprus      and       Malta      that these countries apply the existing Community legislation on maritime safety as soon as possible and certainly no later than the date of their accession.      Voluntary agreement with industry      In order to act as speedily as possible and to avoid further disasters like the Erika, the Commission proposes that the oil companies should undertake by voluntary agreement to refrain in future from chartering tankers older than 15 years (unless appropriate inspections show them to be in a satisfactory condition) and to take any other measures necessary to improve safety. The discussions on this voluntary agreement should also be reflected in improvements to the reform of the oil companies' liability arrangements.     In addition to the measures proposed in this communication, the Commission considers that the proliferation of operational       pollution      by all types of ships and the risk of particularly serious pollution by bunker oil in the event of accidents are also cause for concern. It therefore plans to examine preventive Community initiatives that could be taken in this respect.      Entry into force of the "Erika I" legislation      The Erika I legislative package entered into force on 22 July 2003. These maritime safety regulations, proposed in the wake of the shipping disaster and adopted on 19 December 2001, have been in force since 22 January 2002.     Member States had until 22 July 2003 to apply them by adopting the requisite laws, regulations and administrative provisions, and are required to notify the Commission of the transposition of these acts into national law as soon as they enter into force. Only Denmark, France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom have complied with this.     In addition, the Commission, pursuant to the Directive on port State control, has published a list of ships which are to be denied access to EU ports if they are detained again after 22 July 2003. This list includes ships whose flag State is described as very high risk or high risk in the blacklist published in the Paris Memorandum of Understanding annual report.

   BSE: state of play in March 2003     BSE: state of play in March 2003     Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is a transmissible, neurodegenerative and fatal disease of the family of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) which affects the brains of cattle. Various hypotheses have been advanced to explain the emergence of the pathogenic agent, such as its spontaneous presence in cattle whose carcasses were subsequently introduced into the food chain or its entry into this chain via the intermediary of sheep carcasses affected by a similar disease, scrapie.     Diagnosed for the first time in the United Kingdom in 1986, the "mad cow disease" took on epidemic proportions and finally posed a genuine public health problem following the discovery of a possible link between BSE and its human variant, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, first diagnosed in 1996. By 1 December 2003 a total of 151 confirmed or suspected cases were registered in the European Union, mainly among young people. Most of the cases occurred in the United Kingdom (143), some in France (6), Ireland (1) and Italy (1). Without doubt this disease has also severely undermined consumer confidence and revealed the limits of the Community legislative framework.     Since 1997 the European Commission has thus committed itself to completely overhauling food safety legislation. In particular, the Directorate-General "Health and Consumer Protection" has been responsible since September 1997 for measures designed to protect public health and to guarantee food safety.      The current context      Since the early 1990s Community policy in the field of veterinary monitoring has become increasingly vigilant following the appearance in the United Kingdom of the first cases of BSE. The European Commission has adopted a large number of emergency measures to prevent the spread of this disease in the other Member States. It has prohibited any exportation from the United Kingdom of cattle and beef products and required the systematic slaughtering of herds in which a case of BSE has been diagnosed. Since January 2001 the ban on using "animal meal" in animal feeding has been in force throughout the territory of the European Union.     Currently, despite the detection of new cases of disease as a result of systematic checks, the BSE crisis is clearly on the wane. The       number of BSE cases detected      (more than 182 000 cases since 1986 in the United Kingdom and more than 3 800 in other countries, including 13 Member States) is steadily decreasing, in particular thanks to the improvement of the situation in the United Kingdom. In some Member States this number has nevertheless increased because of the systematisation of detection tests since July 2001. Arguably, the discovery of a number of cases in countries which practise active monitoring is more reassuring than the absence of cases notified in countries in which monitoring is unsatisfactory. Besides, in October 2002 France became the last Member State to lift the ban on British beef, whose exportation has again been permitted since August 1999 in the framework of the DBES (Date Based Exportation System) established at the time.     In the framework of Community law, all the emergency measures adopted are now being replaced by basic legislation which reinforces the rules governing the prevention, control and eradication of all transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). This is the role of Regulation (EC) No       999/2001      which, by defining clear and uniform rules governing the entire food chain, should enable professionals and consumers to look to the future in a more serene manner. It goes without saying that in the light of enlargement and the adoption of the Community       acquis      by the future Member States, this new Regulation will play a decisive role in the field of animal health.       Regulation (EC) No 999/2001       Adopted in May 2001,       Regulation (EC) No 999/2001      [Official Journal L 147 of 31.05.2001] of the European Parliament and of the Council now constitutes the fundamental legal basis for all legislative instruments relating to BSE. In compliance with the       general principles of food safety      it consolidates previously scattered legislation of an overly sectorial nature. The Regulation is based on the latest scientific opinions and the recommendations of competent international organisations (World Health Organisation, Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, International Office for Epizootic Diseases). Due to the magnitude of the BSE crisis, the Regulation is based on Title 152 ("Public Health") of the Treaty establishing the European Community. It lays down measures governing the prevention, control and eradication of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) in bovine, ovine and caprine animals.     Notably the Regulation lays down:      the procedure, criteria and categories making it possible to define the BSE status of the Member States and third countries;       the nature and treatment of specified risk material (SRM);       the active monitoring system:       prohibitions concerning animal feeding.       Classification of Member States as regards BSE      At the Commission's initiative, the Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) of the European Union has prepared a "geographic risk assessment" of the BSE situation in the EU Member States and in third countries. The method used to carry out this assessment, which has lasted more than two years, is based on the dossiers submitted by the countries concerned in response to a Commission Recommendation of 1998. This recommendation defines the information needed to carry out such an assessment. It notably concerns imports of live bovines and meat and bone meal from the United Kingdom and other BSE affected countries, the feeding of mammalian meat and bone meal to ruminants, animal by-product rendering practices, the use of specified risk material (SRM) and the use of meat and bonemeal to feed ruminant animals.     The SSC has defined four categories on the basis of the geographic risk assessment :      Level I: countries in which BSE is highly unlikely;       Level II: countries in which BSE is unlikely but not excluded;       Level III: countries in which BSE is likely but not confirmed, or confirmed but at a low level;       Level IV: countries in which BSE has been confirmed at a large scale.      The SSC has evaluated or is still evaluating the status of third countries in respect of the geographical risk of BSE as though they were EU Member States. This geographical risk of BSE is the only determining factor which can specify the level of protection required. Up to now, the existence of BSE has been judged highly unlikely in the 17 following third countries: Argentina, Australia, Botswana, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Iceland, Namibia, Nicaragua, the French overseas territory New Caledonia, New Zealand, Panama, Paraguay, Salvador, Singapore, Swaziland, Uruguay, Vanuatu. Hence these countries have been exempted from restrictions. Currently, no EU Member States benefit from a similar status. Besides, the WHO rules are respected in the sense that the Union notifies its BSE measures to third countries.     Regulation (EC) No       999/2001      , which entered into force on 1 July 2001, provides for the classification of the countries in five BSE risk categories in line with the code imposed by the OIE. Currently the Commission is preparing this classification, which involves two stages: an initial risk assessment taking into account specific predefined factors and a second assessment on the basis of additional criteria. Pending the determination of the BSE status, transitional measures apply. They are based on the classical geographical BSE risk assessment as undertaken by the Scientific Steering Committee.      Specified risk material (SRM)      Scientists very soon realised that certain tissues are very likely to carry the infectious agent and transmit BSE. By systematically eliminating them from the human and animal food chain, it seems that it is possible to reduce the risk of transmission appreciably.     As from April 1996, a group of experts set up by the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended that all animals, as well as products derived from them, which have shown signs of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy be excluded from the human and animal food chain. In the same year the Scientific Veterinary Committee (SVC) also recommended that, pursuant to the       precautionary principle      , these tissues or "specified risk material" (SRM) be systematically withdrawn and destroyed in order to eliminate any risk of recycling TSE agents.     SRM is currently the subject of transitional measures. These are applicable pending the adoption of a Community decision concerning the BSE classification of the country under consideration. Besides establishing procedures for eliminating specified risk material, Regulation (EC) No       999/2001      also defines their specific nature:      the skull excluding the mandible but including the brain and eyes, the vertebral column excluding the vertebrae of the tail, the transverse processes of the lumbar and thoracic vertebrae and the wings of the sacrum, including dorsal root ganglia, and spinal cord of bovine animals aged over 12 months, and also the tonsils, the intestines from the duodenum to the rectum and the mesentery of bovine animals of all ages;       the skull including the brain and eyes, the tonsils, the spinal chord of ovine and caprine animals aged over 12 months or which have a permanent incisor erupted through the gum, and the spleen and ileum of ovine and caprine animals of all ages.      Besides the SRM referred to above, the following tissues from the United Kingdom and Portugal (with the exception of the Autonomous Region of the Azores) must be designated as such: the entire head, excluding the tongue, but including the brain, eyes and trigeminal ganglia; the thymus, spleen and spinal cord of bovine animals aged over six months.     A derogation is possible to allow the use of the vertebral column and dorsal root ganglia from bovine animals born, raised and slaughtered in Member States where a scientific assessment suggests that BSE is highly unlikely. The same applies to bovine animals from Member States which have declared cases of BSE born after the effective ban on the feeding of mammalian protein to ruminants. To benefit from this derogation, the United Kingdom, Portugal and Sweden must produce scientific evidence. The derogation is not applicable to bovine animals aged over 30 months from the United Kingdom or Portugal (with the exception of the Azores).     The bones of bovine, ovine and caprine animals must not be used for the production of mechanically recovered meat. Meat from the head and the vertebral column of bovine animals aged over 12 months and the tongue of bovine animals of all ages must be collected using specific methods.     Specified risk materials are removed in slaughterhouses, cutting establishments in the case of the vertebral column of bovine animals and, where appropriate, the approved establishments referred to in Regulation (EC) No       1774/2002      concerning       animal by-products not intended for human consumption      . On removal, all SRM and by-products thereof must be stained with a dye or marker. They must be used and destroyed in accordance with Regulation (EC) No       1774/2002      . Member States must carry out frequent official checks to ensure that these provisions are being applied and that measures are adopted to avoid contamination all along the production line.      Active monitoring system      The BSE incubation period is approximately four to five years. During this period, bovine animals exposed to the causative agent do not present any symptoms. In order to monitor the trends of the epidemic, an active monitoring system is thus necessary. Hence the commission must approve and finance national monitoring programmes for TSEs and scrapie together with specific measures (purchase of screening kits, slaughtering, genotyping) in the Member States as well as Cyprus, Estonia, Malta and Slovenia.     Each Member State must carry out an annual programme for monitoring BSE and scrapie. Annex III sets out the monitoring system to be applied for these two diseases. Since January 2001, besides the compulsory controls of all the animals displaying signs compatible with a TSE, the rapid       post mortem      screening must be practised on:      all bovine animals aged over 24 months intended for human consumption and subjected to emergency slaughtering;       all bovine animals aged over 30 months, slaughtered in normal conditions for human consumption or as part of a BSE eradication campaign;Sweden may derogate from this rule by performing the tests only on a random sample of animals;       all bovine animals aged over 24 months not intended for human consumption, found dead, or slaughtered (but not in connection with an epidemic such as foot-and-mouth disease);Member States may derogate from these provisions in remote areas where the animal population density is low and there are no arrangements for the collection of dead animals. They must inform the Commission accordingly. The derogation may not be applied to more than 10 % of the Member State's bovine animal population;       all bovine animals which are emergency slaughtered or declared sick following         ante mortem        screening;       all bovine animals aged over 42 months, born after 1 August 1996;       a random sample comprising at least 10 000 bovine animals per year;       all ovine and caprine animals not intended for human consumption aged over 18 months or with more than two permanent incisors erupted through the gum, which have been found dead or have been slaughtered (though not as part of an eradication campaign);Member States must carry out screening tests based on a representative sample, giving priority to animals found dead on the farm;       since 1 October 2003, animals aged over 12 months with a permanent incisor erupted through the gum, on the basis of a representative sample;       all other animals;Member States may carry out monitoring programmes in respect of animals used for dairy production, animals derived from herds infected with TSE or derived from TSE infected females, animals which have consumed potentially contaminated feed.      The Member States must submit to the Commission an annual report notably containing information on the number of suspected cases by animal species which have been subjected to movement restrictions.     A total of over 8.5 million bovine animals were tested in 2001 and over 10 million in 2002. Currently the Commission is co-financing the test programme in the amount of 10.5 euros per test. Further information on the number of       tests carried out      and the number of detected cases can be found at the European Commission's "Food Safety" site.      Prohibitions concerning animal feeding      Very soon after the emergence of BSE, British scientists suspected that the consumption by bovine animals of meat and bone meal was responsible for the spread of the epizootic. Since July 1998, the United Kingdom has banned the use of mammalian proteins in the feeding of ruminant animals. This prohibition entered into force in the European Union in June 1994, the date of adoption of the first Community decision in this connection [Decision       94/381/EC      , repealed by Regulation (EC) No       1326/2001      ].     Regulation (EC) No       999/2001      lays down measures concerning animal feeding and upholds the ban on the use of animal proteins and feedingstuffs containing such proteins in the feeding of ruminants. Livestock, with the exception of fur-producing carnivores, must not be fed with processed animal protein, gelatine of ruminant origin, blood products, hydrolysed protein, dicalcium phosphate and tricalcium phosphate of animal origin.     These prohibitions do not apply to the use of the following feedingstuffs and proteins which, where appropriate, have been processed in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No       1774/2002      on animal by-products not intended for human consumption:      in the feeding of non-ruminants: fishmeal, hydrolised proteins derived from non-ruminants and ruminant hides and skins, dicalcium phosphate and tricalcium phosphate;       in the feeding of ruminants: milk, milk-based products and colostrum, eggs and egg products, gelatine derived from non-ruminants;       in the feeding of fish: blood products and blood meal derived from non-ruminants.      Since 1 November 2003, Member States have been required to provide the other Member States and the Commission with an up-to-date list of slaughterhouses approved by the European Union which do not slaughter ruminants. They must also forward a list of establishments authorised to produce the feedingstuffs and proteins referred to above.     Exports to third countries of processed animal proteins from ruminants and of products containing such proteins must comply with the legislation in force in the Community territory. The third country of destination must provide a prior undertaking in writing to use and/or export products taking account of the intended final use. The Member State authorising the export must inform the other Member States and the Commission.     The legislation on animal waste enhances the effectiveness of the ban on "animal meal". In this connection, Regulation (EC) No       1774/2002      [Official Journal L 273 of 10.10.2002] on       animal by-products not intended for human consumption      entered into force in May 2003. It lays down strict control measures concerning the collection, transport, storage, processing and use or disposal of 16 million tons of material unsuitable for consumption produced each year. It also prohibits intra-species recycling in order to exclude cannibalism.      Research and development on BSE      The European Commission has been financing research on TSEs since 1990. This research activity was rapidly expanded following the announcement by the UK Government in March 1996 that 10 cases of new-variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease might be linked to exposure to BSE.     In April 1996, the Commission invited Professor Charles Weissmann to chair the group responsible for drawing up an inventory of existing knowledge in this area and to suggest priorities for research. Published in October of the same year, Professor Weissmann's report was the basis for a communication from the Commission to the Council [       COM(96)582      final] proposing a TSE plan of action. This plan of action also took into account the recommendations of the Multidisciplinary Scientific Committee and ongoing research at national and Community level. It included two levels:      the coordination of activities between the Member States, with a view to harmonising data collection and diagnostic criteria;       a specific call for proposals intended to stimulate research at Community level.      The first of the three calls for proposals in the framework of this initiative was launched in December 1996, the last in March 1998. A total of 54 projects have been approved and have received EUR 50.7 million altogether in the framework of the BIOMED, BIOTECH and FAIR programmes. Hence the plan of action made it possible to rally experts in numerous scientific disciplines and from more than 120 laboratories in all the Member States and associated countries.     In November 2000, the Research Council requested the Commission to establish a TSE Expert Group with a mandate to examine the state of TSE research, encourage the exchange of scientific information between research teams, identify ongoing research activities which need to be strengthened, as well as new research activities which need to be launched. The Group is composed of representatives nominated from the Member States, Associated Countries, some members of the TSE/BSE       ad hoc      group of the Scientific Steering Committee and some co-ordinators of EU research projects. In April 2002, with an eye to enlargement, it was expanded to include members from Central and Eastern European States.     The plan of action [       COM(96) 582      final] notably included the objective to expand and regularly update the inventory of TSE research activities in Member States. The Commission has published a specific communication relating to this [       COM(2001) 323      final].     In April 2001 an analysis of the most recent version of the Weissmann report resulted in the launch of a specific call for TSE proposals, intended to fill the gaps in the European TSE research effort. A total of 15 new TSE projects were commissioned from this call with support totalling EUR 21 million. All in all, the fifth framework programme for research and development (1998-2002) will have supported 26 projects to a tune of almost 30 million euros: 11 research projects financed following general calls for proposals and 15 on the basis of the specific call for proposals of 2001.     The       sixth framework programme      for research and development (2002-2006) includes priorities for actions concerning "Food quality and risks to health" and has a budget of 685 million euros allocated to this. The transversal objective is to establish the scientific and technological bases needed to produce and distribute safer, healthier and varied food. It is this strand which will participate in financing research into TSEs.      International dimension and enlargement      In the accession negotiations all candidate countries have committed themselves to fully comply with the Community rules on combating BSE. They have made substantial progress: all of them are already removing the specified risk materials from the food chain and majority of them are testing all healthy cattle aged over 30 months. In 2003, 40 % of the veterinary inspections of the Food and Veterinary Office (       FVO      ) will take place in future Member States with a view to verifying the measures taken with regard to food safety, including those designed to combat BSE. In addition, the Commission cofinances screening kits and provides its technical assistance in the framework of the       Phare      programme.     At international level the European Union has developed close cooperation with the following international organisations: the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) and the International Office on Epizootic Diseases (OIE).     Since 1991 the WHO has organised 11 scientific consultations on issues concerning human and animal TSEs. The group of independent specialists set up by the WHO continues to update knowledge on the basis of new scientific information. A neutral forum has been set up to examine, evaluate and discuss scientific questions concerning TSEs. The WHO encourages research in this field by publishing a list of 11 priority areas, notably on early diagnosis and epidemiology. Finally, it promotes systematic monitoring of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease and its variants in order to get a clearer picture of its geographical breakdown throughout the world. Consult the       BSE section      at the WHO site.     A BSE consultative committee was set up at the FAO in 1990. In cooperation with the WHO and the OIE it regularly convenes scientific experts who review research developments in this area.     Based in Paris, the International Office on Epizootic Diseases (       OIE      ) has been the international organisation on animal health since 1924. It aims to ensure transparency as regards the animal diseases situation throughout the world, notably BSE. It collects, analyses and disseminates scientific veterinary information and provides its international expertise with a view to combating animal diseases. It guarantees the food safety of world trade by drafting health rules on the international trade of animals and their products.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005 establishing a FLEGT licensing scheme for imports of timber   what is the aim of the regulation   Known as the  forest law enforcement, governance and trade (FLEGT) regulation  , it ensures that timber and timber products exported to the EU by partner countries that have signed a voluntary partnership agreement (VPA) with the EU and implement a FLEGT licensing scheme have been harvested legally.   It complements Regulation (EU) No  995/2010  , which aims to prohibit the placing of illegally harvested timber and products derived from such timber on the EU market.   It was amended by Regulation (EU) No  657/2014  , Delegated Regulation (EU)  2016/1387  and by Regulation (EU)  2019/1010  .   key points    This regulation applies to imports of timber products listed in Annexes II and III from  partner countries  listed in Annex I.   Membership of the FLEGT licensing scheme is implemented through   voluntary partnership agreements (VPAs)   with timber-producing countries that wish to sign such agreements with the EU. Each VPA specifies the agreed schedule and the commitments.   Exporting countries that sign a VPA must develop a  verification system  for the legality of their timber products.   All timber shipments from VPA countries that have an operational FLEGT licensing scheme must be covered by a  FLEGT licence that certifies compliance  with the requirements of the FLEGT licensing scheme. Without a FLEGT licence, timber shipments cannot enter the EU market.   When there is any doubt about the  validity of a FLEGT licence  at an EU border, competent authorities must request further verification by the authority that issued the licence (the costs of the check are met by the importer unless the EU country in question decides otherwise). Customs authorities may suspend the release of timber if they believe the FLEGT licence to be invalid.   EU countries must determine the  sanctions  to be imposed for violation of this regulation.    Amendments    Regulation (EU) No 657/2014 amended Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005 granting the  European Commission  the power to adopt  delegated  and  implementing acts  .   Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1387 amends Annexes I and III, recognising the fact that  Indonesia  became the first partner country to have an operational FLEGT licensing scheme and issue FLEGT licences.   Regulation (EU) 2019/1010 amends the original regulation with regard to the  reports  that EU countries have to prepare each year. Under the  original regulation  , they had to submit a report to the European Commission indicating quantities of timber imports under the FLEGT licensing scheme, the number of licenses received and the number of cases and quantities of timber and timber products imported without a FLEGT licence (i.e. prohibited imports). The amending regulation does not, however, specify what should be included in the report to be submitted by EU countries. It also requires EU countries not only to submit these reports to the Commission, but also to make them available to the  public  .   Regulation (EU) 2019/1010 also requires the Commission to submit a  report  to the  European Parliament  and the  Council   on the functioning and effectiveness of the regulation  every 5 years starting in 2021.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 30 December 2005.   background   The FLEGT authorisation system was first proposed in 2003 in the  FLEGT action plan  , which aimed to combat illegal logging and improve the supply and demand of legal timber. It mainly targeted the timber-rich regions of central Africa, Russia, south-east Asia, and parts of South America.

   Iceland – Information society and media     Iceland – Information society and media     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM(2011) 666      final – SEC(2011) 1202 final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The       2011 Report      provides a positive assessment of the application of the European Union (EU) rules, which is largely due to Iceland’s participation in the       European Economic Area      (EEA) and in European programmes.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission’s words)      The       acquis      includes specific rules relating to       electronic communications      ,       information society services      , particularly e-commerce and services based on conditional access, and to audiovisual services. In the field of electronic communications, the       acquis      aims at removing the obstacles preventing the smooth running of the internal market of telecommunications services and networks, at encouraging competition and at protecting consumers’ interests, specifically by guaranteeing the universal availability of modern services.     In terms of       audiovisual policy      , the       acquis      requires legislative alignment with the       Television without Frontiers Directive      which creates the conditions for the free movement of television programmes in the European Union. The       acquis      intends to define a transparent, reliable and efficient regulatory framework for public and private broadcasting which meets European standards. It also estimates the capacity for participating in the Community programmes Media Plus and Media Training.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      The country has already achieved a satisfactory level of alignment and has already applied a significant part of the EU       acquis      in the fields of       information      and       media      . However, the revised European framework for the regulation of communications still needs to be transposed. Similarly, several gaps need to be filled with regard to transposing the rules of audiovisual policy and information society policy.

summary   Many of the systems and services that are today essential for Europeans' well-being and security depend directly or indirectly on space. They rely on space technologies when using their mobile phones, making financial transactions, taking a plane, watching the weather forecast or looking for the nearest restaurant using car navigation system. Space has become part of their daily lives. The Commission therefore proposes  a new space policy  to meet the challenges of today's world.  Europe's space industry is a driver for growth and innovation and a highly strategic sector, helping citizens face both societal challenges and create innovative technologies and services.   Commercial and innovation challenges:    Across the world, the space industry is highly subsidized through institutional programmes which translate into financing of research and development (R&D) programmes and purchasing of space products and services. Total European R&D is roughly estimated to account for 10% of unconsolidated sales turnover of the EU space sector. In an international context, the funding of European R&D is relatively small. The European institutional market is relatively small - in 2009, the US budget was almost 10 times higher than the European budget - and very fragmented, due to the diversity of public stakeholders and their different and not always coordinated industrial policies.   The satellite communications (SatCom) industry is instrumental in sustaining the entire European space industry. This segment's sales account for more than 60% of the European space manufacturing industry over the last ten years. Although Europe can count on a world-class SatCom industry, this sector faces not only increasing global competition but also technical and political challenges due to the scarcity of the radio spectrum.   Europe needs to position itself in the emerging markets for navigation (SatNav) and Earth observation applications (SatEO), services and products. These service industries have a high potential for growth and job creation. However, the development of the European satellite-based services industry is currently challenged by the existing regulatory framework and insufficient support to start-up companies which are at the heart of services and applications development.   To address these challenges, Europe should achieve  technological non-dependence, security of supply  and maintain  independent access to space  .  The new space communication identifies the main challenges the European space industry faces and proposes a series of measures to help it become more competitive at global level.  A  press release  summarises the key points of the communication.

   Single European Sky — EU rules on air navigation services     Single European Sky — EU rules on air navigation services     SUMMARY OF:      Regulation (EC) No 550/2004 on the provision of air navigation services in the single European sky      WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?     The regulation establishes requirements for the safe and efficient provision of air navigation services for general air traffic in the European Union (EU) as part of the       single European sky       *      initiative. It is a binding regulation, applicable to all EU countries.     KEY POINTS     The regulation outlines the air navigation service provider certification procedures to be adopted by the supervisory authorities of EU countries. Certificates, valid in all EU countries, specify the rights and obligations of air navigation service providers. This includes access to services for airspace users       *      without discrimination, and with particular regard to safety, and the possibility of offering services to other providers, airspace users and airports within the EU.      Requirements for certification      These include:      competence and suitability;       systems for safety and quality management;       reporting systems and financial strength;       liability, insurance and security;       ownership and organisational structure, including the prevention of conflicts of interest;       human resources, including staffing.       National supervisory authorities      National supervisory authorities in EU countries are each responsible for designating a certificate-holder to provide exclusive air traffic services. They also ensure compliance for blocks of airspace under their control. This takes place jointly (or by agreement) if a block extends over more than one country, or if a certificate holder operates in more than one country.     If a provider does not meet the requirements, the authorities concerned can take action, including revoking the certificate. The authorities then become responsible for assuring continuity of service.      Functional airspace blocks      EU and non-EU countries, where appropriate, must by mutual agreement ensure the implementation of functional airspace blocks. These should have the necessary capacity and efficiency to maintain a high level of safety and reduced environmental impact. A functional airspace blocks system coordinator may be appointed by the European Commission to assist in this process.     National authorities may also designate an       exclusive provider      of meteorological services.     For general air traffic       *      , real-time operational data are exchanged between air navigation service providers, airspace users and airports, solely to facilitate operational needs. Approved written agreements are set up formalising working arrangements between service providers, and with military authorities.     The regulation requires open accounting procedures and lays out detailed guidelines for fair and transparent pricing of navigation services for airspace users.     FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?     It has applied since 20 April 2004.     BACKGROUND     For more information, see:       Single European Sky 2+        (         European Commission        ).      KEY TERMS      Single European sky:      an initiative by which the design, management and regulation of airspace is coordinated throughout the EU.      Airspace users:      operators of aircraft used for general air traffic.      General air traffic:      flights conducted in accordance with the rules and procedures of the       International Civil Aviation Organization      . These may include some military flights.

act   Council Directive  2001/111/EC  of 20 December 2001 relating to certain sugars intended for human consumption [Official Journal L 10 of 12.01.2002].   summary   Directive 2001/111/CE improves the labelling of certain edible sugars in order to better inform consumers and to prevent them from being misled by the products they buy. It applies without prejudice to the general provisions relating to the labelling of foodstuffs.   Sugars   Directive 2001/111/EC defines eleven sugar varieties:   semi-white sugar;   sugar (white sugar);   extra-white sugar;   sugar solution;   invert sugar solution;   invert sugar syrup;   glucose syrup;   dried glucose syrup;   dextrose monohydrate;   dextrose or dextrose anhydrous;   fructose.   Each variety has corresponding compositional characteristics and rules relating to packaging and labelling.   Labelling   Directive 2001/111/EC lays down certain specific provisions for pre-packaged products weighing less than 20 g, for sugar solutions, for invert sugar syrup containing crystals as well as for certain products containing more than 5 % fructose. The net weight of pre-packaged products weighing less than 20 g need not be indicated on the labelling. However, the labelling of invert sugar solutions and invert sugar syrup must indicate the levels of dry matter and invert sugar content. Furthermore, the labelling of invert sugar syrup containing crystals must include the qualifying term crystallised. Finally, glucose syrups (including dried glucose syrups) which contain more than 5 % of fructose (dry matter) must be labelled as glucose-fructose syrup or fructose-glucose syrup and dried glucose-fructose syrup or dried fructose-glucose syrup, to reflect whether the glucose component or the fructose component is in greater proportion.  For the products defined in the Annex, Member States shall not adopt national provisions not provided for by this Directive.   Context   This Directive forms part of the programme to simplify certain vertical Directives relating to foodstuffs in order to take account only of the essential requirements to be met by the products they cover so that those products may move freely within the internal market.

summary of   Decision 2008/615/JHA — cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime   what is the aim of the decision  It aims to improve cross-border cooperation between EU countries’ police and judicial authorities to combat terrorism and cross-border crime more effectively. It focuses particularly on automated exchanges of information. It also focuses on major events and on fighting terrorism.  The decision stems from a multilateral treaty signed in 2005 by Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Austria. It has been transformed into a legal instrument binding all EU countries. The  Council  subsequently adopted the Prüm decision and its implementing rules.   key points   The decision sets out rules with regard to:   the automated access to DNA profiles, dactyloscopic data  *  and certain national vehicle registration data;   supply of data in relation to major events;   supply of information in order to prevent terrorist offences;   other measures for stepping up cross-border police cooperation.    Establishment of national databases and automated access to data    EU countries must establish  national DNA analysis files  for the purpose of investigating criminal offences.   Reference data, consisting of the non-coding part of the DNA  *  and of a reference number that does not enable an individual to be identified, must be made available to other EU countries to carry out automated searches  *  .   Searches are performed via national contact points by comparing DNA profiles  *  , but only on the basis of individual cases and in a hit/no-hit  *  manner.   EU countries must also make available reference data from the  national automated fingerprint identification systems  (AFIS).   The searches are carried out by comparing dactyloscopic data and, similarly to DNA searches, only in individual cases on a hit/no-hit basis.   National contact points must also be given access to certain  national vehicle registration data  via automated online searches.    Supply of data relating to major events    In relation to any major events involving more than one EU country, the countries concerned must provide each other with non-personal data  *  , as required for the purpose of preventing criminal offences and maintaining public order and security.   Personal data may be supplied only if the data subjects are considered a threat to public order and security or if it is believed that they will commit criminal offences at the events. The data may  only be used in relation to the event it was provided for  and must be  deleted  once it has served its purpose, but no later than  1 year  after it was supplied.    Supply of information to fight terrorism   In individual cases and with certain restrictions, EU countries may provide the following data to each other to prevent terrorist attacks:   surname and first names;   date and place of birth;   description of the conditions leading to the supposition that criminal offences will be committed.    Other measures for enhancing cross-border police cooperation    EU countries can carry out joint patrols and other joint operations to prevent criminal offences and to maintain public order and security on a given EU country’s territory.   EU countries are to provide mutual assistance to each other in cases of mass gatherings and other comparable major events, disasters and serious accidents.   from when does the decision apply  It has applied since 26 August 2008.   background   For more information, see:    European information exchange model (EIXM)  (  European Commission  ).    Communication from the Commission — COVID-19 Guidance on the implementation of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU, on the facilitation of transit arrangements for the repatriation of EU citizens, and on the effects on visa policy    key terms    Dactyloscopic data:  fingerprint images, images of fingerprint latents (latents are prints which are invisible to the naked eye and must be professionally analysed), palm prints, palm print latents and templates of such images that are stored and dealt with in an automated database.   Non-coding part of DNA:  chromosome regions that are not expressed genetically, i.e. not known to provide for any functional properties of an organism.   Automated searching:  an online access procedure for consulting the databases of one, several, or all of the EU countries.   DNA profile:  a letter or number code that represents a set of identification characteristics of the non-coding part of an analysed human DNA sample.   Hit/no-hit procedure:  parties grant each other limited access to the reference data in their national DNA and fingerprint databases. They also grant the right to use these data to conduct automated checks of fingerprints and DNA profiles. The personal information related to the reference data is not available to the requesting party.   Non-personal data:  data containing individual DNA profiles which may be used to establish a match or ‘hit’, but which do not reveal the identity of the data subject.
   European contract law     European contract law     With this communication, the European Commission aims to broaden the debate on European contract law by involving the European Parliament, the Council and the other stakeholders, including businesses, legal practitioners, academics and consumer groups.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on European contract law [       COM(2001) 398      final - Official Journal C 255 of 13.9.2001].     SUMMARY     The approximation of certain specific areas of contract law at Community level has covered an increasing number of issues. The Community legislator has followed a selective approach, adopting directives on specific contracts or marketing techniques where a particular need for harmonisation was identified. The Commission is interested in gathering information on the need for wider-reaching Community action in the area of contract law, in particular to the extent that the case-by-case approach might not be able to solve all the problems which might arise.     The Commission is seeking information as to whether problems result from divergences in contract law between Member States and, if so, what these problems are. In particular, it asks whether the proper functioning of the internal market may be hindered by problems relating to the conclusion, interpretation and application of cross-border contracts. It is also interested in whether different national contract laws discourage cross-border transactions or increase the related costs.     The communication also seeks views on whether the existing approach of sectoral harmonisation of contract law could lead to possible inconsistencies at Community or national level as regards application of the transposition measures.     If concrete problems are identified, the Commission would also like to receive views from the private sector and civil society on what form solutions should or could take. In order to assist in defining possible solutions, the communication includes a non-exhaustive list of possible solutions. However, other solutions may be suggested by any interested party.     The proposed solutions are:      to leave the solution of any problems identified to the market;       to promote the development of non-binding, common contract law principles. These principles could be useful for contracting parties in drafting their contracts, for national courts and arbitrators in their decisions and for national legislators in drawing up legislative initiatives;       to review and improve existing Community legislation in the area of contract law so as to make it more coherent or to adapt it to cover situations not foreseen at the time of adoption;       to adopt a new instrument at Community level, combining rules on general aspects of contract law and on specific questions.      If the best solution envisaged is the adoption of a consistent and comprehensive instrument, the Commission recalls that several variables must be taken into consideration. In this connection, it will be appropriate to discuss:      the nature of the instrument to be adopted (regulation, directive or recommendation);       the link with the national legislation (which might be replaced or which might co-exist alongside Community legislation);       the possibility of distinguishing between mandatory and non-binding rules;       whether the contracting parties would choose to apply the Community instrument or whether certain rules apply automatically as a safety net of fallback provisions if the contracting parties have not agreed a specific solution.      The communication merely intends to stimulate a debate.

The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM(2010) 660      final – SEC(2010) 1326 - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The       2010 Report      presents the progress made in implementing taxation rules. However, gaps remain in the area of fiscal control and the fight against fraud.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission’s words)      The acquis on taxation covers extensively the area of       indirect taxation      , namely value-added tax (VAT) and excise duties. It lays down the scope, definitions and principles of VAT. Excise duties on tobacco products, alcoholic beverages and energy products are also subject to EU legislation. As concerns       direct taxation      , the acquis covers some aspects of taxing income from savings of individuals and of corporate taxes. Furthermore, Member States are committed to complying with the principles of the Code of Conduct for       Business Taxation      , aimed at the elimination of harmful tax measures. Administrative co-operation and mutual assistance between Member States is aimed at ensuring a smooth functioning of the internal market as concerns taxation and provides tools to prevent       intra-Community tax evasion and tax avoidance      . Member States must ensure that the necessary implementing and enforcement capacities, including links to the relevant EU computerised taxation systems, are in place.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      No progress was made in harmonising       direct and indirect taxation      legislation with the       acquis      . Progress can be reported in the area of operational capacity for the tax administration (taxpayers’ services and audit efficiency).     RELATED ACTS      Commission Report [         COM(2009) 533        final – SEC(2009) 1333 final – Not published in the Official Journal].       Commission Report [         COM(2008) 674        final - SEC(2008) 2694 final - Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2008 Report noted very limited progress as regards taxation and no improvement in terms of legislative alignment. Administrative capacity was to be strengthened, as was IT interconnectivity.      Commission Report [         COM(2007) 663        final - SEC(2007) 1431 - Not published in the Official Journal].      In its 2007 Report, the Commission stated that some progress had been made as regards taxation. Croatia was to continue to take steps to bring its national tax legislation into line with the Community       acquis      . It was also to continue to increase its administrative capacity.      Commission Report [         COM(2006) 649        final – SEC(2006) 1385 – Not published in the Official Journal].      According to the 2006 Report, limited progress had been made in the field of taxation. Croatia still needed to undertake major efforts to align with the Community       acquis      . For instance, the tax administration needed to be reinforced and there should be greater interconnectivity between IT systems in order to implement and enforce the       acquis      in the field of taxation.      Commission Report [         COM(2005) 561        final - SEC(2005) 1424 - Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2005 Report contained very little progress in the field of taxation as legislative activity had been extremely limited. The report indicated that major efforts were required if alignment with the       acquis      was to be achieved in good time. Two important priorities for Croatia were modernising the tax administration and improving IT interconnectivity.      Commission Opinion [         COM(2004) 257        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      In its April 2004 Opinion, the Commission stated that Croatia had to make considerable efforts to align its legislation with the Community       acquis      , particularly with regard to the interconnectivity of IT systems.     In order to bring the VAT system into line with the       acquis      , legislation had to then be modified and sales tax removed as a matter of urgency. Further work was required regarding direct taxation and excise duties. Serious efforts were also required to recruit and train staff to strengthen the tax administration, which was not very effective at tax collection and control, and to simplify legal and prosecution procedures.

   Agreements with the countries of the Western Balkans on the facilitation of the issuance of visas     Agreements with the countries of the Western Balkans on the facilitation of the issuance of visas     The agreements concluded between the European Union (EU) and the countries of the Western Balkans on facilitating the issuance of visas are intended to simplify and speed up the procedures for issuing visas to nationals of these Western Balkan countries. These agreements are, in principle, coupled with readmission agreements.     ACT      Council Decision         2007/821/EC        of 8 November 2007 on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Albania on the facilitation of the issuance of visas.       Council Decision         2007/822/EC        of 8 November 2007 on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and Bosnia and Herzegovina on the facilitation of the issuance of visas.

Council Decision         2007/824/EC        of 8 November 2007 on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on the facilitation of the issuance of visas.       Council Decision         2007/825/EC        of 8 November 2007 on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Serbia on the facilitation of the issuance of visas.      SUMMARY     The agreements concluded with Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ("partner countries") are intended to facilitate the issuance of short-stay visas to citizens of these countries for stays of       up to 90 days      per period of 180 days.     When applying for such short-stay visas, citizens of these partner countries benefit from       simplified document requirements      for justifying the purpose of their journey to the European Union (EU). The documentary evidence to be presented consists of formal documents, such as a written request from the host organisation or other certificate, depending on the category of the applicant (business people, drivers for international transportation services, journalists, students, persons travelling for tourism or for medical reasons, representatives of civil society organisations, etc.).     EU countries’ diplomatic missions and consular posts may issue       multiple-entry visas      that are valid for up to five years to: members of the governments, parliaments, constitutional courts and supreme courts of partner countries; permanent members of official delegations; spouses and children under the age of 21 visiting citizens of partner countries legally residing in the territory of an EU country. The categories of persons who benefit from simplified document requirements may also be granted multiple-entry visas with a maximum validity period of one year. However, the person concerned must have obtained and used at least one visa during the previous year and have valid reasons for requesting a multiple-entry visa. If such a person has made use of the one-year multiple-entry visa during the previous two years, s/he may be granted a multiple-entry visa that is valid a minimum of two and a maximum of five years.     The       standard fee      for processing visa applications of partner countries’ citizens is 35 euros. This is waived for certain categories of persons, including close relatives, members of official delegations, students, disabled persons, children under the age of six, journalists, pensioners and drivers for international transportation services.     Visas are issued within       10 days      of the receipt of the application. This may be extended to up to 30 days when further scrutiny of the application is needed or may be reduced to 3 days or even less in emergencies.      Background      The participants at the EU-Western Balkans Summit held in Thessaloniki on 21 June 2003 ("Thessaloniki Agenda") agreed on the principle of liberalisation of the visa regime and began negotiations with a view to concluding the necessary agreements. This process, coupled with discussions on the conclusion of       readmission agreements      , resulted on 8 November 2007 in the adoption of a series of Council decisions, one for each of the partner countries, establishing the conclusion of agreements based on Article 62, taken in conjunction with Article 300, of the Treaty establishing the European Community (now Articles 77 and 218 respectively of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union).

   VAT: labour-intensive services     VAT: labour-intensive services     The present directive allows those Member States wishing to do so to experiment with the operation and impact, in terms of job creation, of a targeted reduction of the VAT rate for labour-intensive services.     ACT     Council Directive       1999/85/EC      of 22 October 1999 amending Directive       77/388/EEC      as regards the possibility of applying on an experimental basis a reduced VAT rate on labour-intensive services [Official Journal L 277 of 28.10.1999].

This Directive amends Directive       77/388/EEC      . It allows Member States to apply the reduced rates to the services listed in a maximum of two of the categories set out in the Annex.     The services in question are:      small repair services (bicycles, shoes and leather goods, clothing and household linen);       renovation and repair of private dwellings, excluding materials which form a significant part of the value of supply;       window cleaning and cleaning in private households;       domestic care services;       hairdressing.      All these services must satisfy the following requirements:      they must be local and labour intensive;       they must be supplied direct to consumers;       they must not be likely to create distortions for competition;       they must have a high price elasticity (if their price falls, demand increases).      The Member States must present a general report to the Commission assessing the effectiveness of the measures in terms of its objectives.     The Commission must submit a report to Parliament and the Council on the Directive, its relevance and implementation.

summary of   Directive 2009/73/EC on common rules for the internal market in natural gas   what is the aim of the directive   It aims to introduce common rules for the transmission, distribution, supply and storage of natural gas  *  with the objectives of providing market access and enabling fair and non-discriminatory competition.   It concerns natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), biogas and gas from biomass.   key points    Rules for the organisation of the sector   These rules are aimed at creating a competitive, secure and environmentally sustainable market in natural gas.  EU countries may impose  public service obligations  on gas companies, covering:   technical safety and security of supply;   regularity and quality of service;   price;    environmental protection  ; and   energy efficiency.   EU countries must ensure that:   all customers have the  right to choose their gas supplier and to change supplier easily  , with their operator’s assistance, within 3 weeks;   customers receive  relevant consumption data  .   EU countries are responsible for  monitoring the security of supply  and in particular:   the balance of supply and demand on the national market;   available supplies;   maintenance of the networks; and   the measures to be taken in the event of supply problems.   Regional or international cooperation may be put in place to ensure the security of supply.  EU countries must ensure the  integration of national markets  at one or more regional levels, as a first step towards the integration of a fully liberalised internal market. The isolated systems which form ‘  gas islands  ’ must also be integrated. In this context, the national regulatory authorities must cooperate with the  Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators  .   Transmission, storage and LNG     Unbundling   *  and transparency of accounts   From 3 March 2012, EU countries were required to  unbundle transmission systems and transmission system operators  . This means that companies active in the production or supply of gas or electricity cannot exercise any rights over a transmission system operator, and vice versa.  EU countries and the competent authorities have right of access to the accounts of natural gas companies but must preserve the  confidentiality  of certain information. Natural gas companies must keep  separate accounts  for all of their activities relating to the supply of gas, such as transmission and distribution.    Designation of transmission system operators    A company must first be certified before being officially designated as a  transmission system operator  . A list of transmission system operators designated by EU countries is then published in the  Official Journal of the European Union  .  In addition and, where applicable, EU countries have to designate one or more storage and LNG system operator.    Tasks of transmission system operators    System operators are responsible for:   operating, maintaining and developing transmission systems, storage and/or LNG facilities with due regard to the environment;   ensuring non-discrimination between system users;   providing information to any other transmission system operator, any other storage system operator, any other LNG system operator and/or any distribution system operator to ensure the interconnection of the transmission and storage of natural gas;   providing system users with the information they need to access the system.   Transmission system operators must build sufficient cross-border capacity to integrate the European transmission infrastructure. Every year, they must submit to the regulatory authority a  10-year network development plan  indicating the main infrastructure that needs to be built or modernised as well as the investments to be executed over the next 10 years.   Distribution and supply   EU countries must designate  distribution system operators  or require companies which own or are responsible for distribution systems to do so.  Distribution system operators are mainly responsible for:   ensuring the long-term capacity of the system in terms of the distribution of gas, operation, maintenance, development and environmental protection;   ensuring transparency with respect to system users;   providing system users with information;   covering energy losses and maintaining reserve capacity.   The distribution system operator must be independent in legal terms from other activities not relating to distribution.   Organisation of access to the system   EU countries or the competent regulatory authorities are responsible for organising a system of  non-discriminatory third-party access to transmission and distribution systems  based on published tariffs. They must ensure that eligible customers can obtain access to upstream pipeline networks. Also, they have to define the  conditions for access to storage facilities and linepack  (the storage of gas by compression in gas transmission and distribution systems).   Additional rules for the internal market in natural gas   Directive (EU)  2019/692  seeks to address obstacles to the completion of the internal market in natural gas which result from the non-application of the EU market rules to gas transmission lines to and from non-EU countries. The amendments introduced by this directive are intended to ensure that the rules applicable to gas transmission lines connecting two or more EU countries are also applicable, within the EU, to gas transmission lines to and from non-EU countries.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 3 September 2009 and had to become law in the EU countries by 3 March 2011.  This directive repealed Directive  2003/55/EC  on 3 March 2011.   background   Two 2007 Commission communications on the  prospects for the internal gas and electricity market  and the  sector inquiry into the gas and electricity markets  highlighted the inadequacy of the rules and measures in force relating to the internal market and showed that the adoption of new rules was required.  For more information, see:    Market legislation  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Natural gas:  a flammable gas which occurs naturally underground, which mainly comprises methane and other hydrocarbons and is mainly used as fuel.   Unbundling:  the separation of gas distribution networks from production and supply activities of gas companies.
act   Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - A European consumer agenda - Boosting confidence and growth (  COM/2012/0225 final  of 22 May 2012).   summary   In 2012, the Commission issued a Communication adopting a European consumer agenda to boost confidence and growth by putting consumers at the heart of the single market.  Two years later, the Commission published a report on consumer policy between January 2012 and December 2013 assessing the initiatives taken since 2012 to increase that confidence, particularly in an era of expanding online and cross-border shopping.   what does the communication do  In 2012, the Commission set out its strategic vision for EU consumer policy in the years ahead. It identified 61 measures to guarantee and strengthen consumers’ confidence in a rapidly changing commercial world. The measures focused on consumer safety, access to information,  redress  and  enforcement  , and ensuring that consumers’ rights keep pace with rapid technological changes.   what has been achieved  A Commission report issued in 2014 concludes that 50 of the measures identified in the 2012 European consumer agenda had been completed by December 2013. The remaining 11 are under way.  The 2014 report records that on:   promoting  consumer safety  , the Commission has adopted proposals on general product safety and market surveillance. More specific initiatives have covered tourist accommodation, medical devices, cosmetics and animal and plant health;   enhancing  knowledge of consumer rights  , the Commission has produced targeted information on consumer protection and launched user-friendly websites and databases. It has discussed with key stakeholders, such as consumer organisations, businesses and regulators, the two basic issues of environmental claims and ways of making online comparisons;   strengthening  enforcement of consumer rules  , major proposals have been adopted on  alternative  and  online  dispute resolution and collective redress;    integrating consumer interests into key policy areas  , the Commission has mainly focused on financial services, digital markets, energy, transport, food and sustainable consumption.   background   Consumer expenditure represents just over 50 % of EU gross domestic product. This gives individuals an enormous collective influence over the health of Europe’s economy. Ensuring their confidence and trust is a fundamental pillar in the growth of the EU’s single market.  Further information is available from the  European Commission Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers  website.
act   Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council: On Progress in Romania under the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism  (COM(2015) 35  final of 28 January 2015).  Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council: On Progress in Romania under the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism (  COM(2014) 37  final of 22 January 2014).   summary   The European Commission (EC) reports of 2014 and 2015 describe the progress made by Romania in those specific areas since 2012 and 2013.   key points   The CVM includes four specific criteria to address Romania’s deficiencies in judicial reform, integrity and the fight against high-level corruption, as well as the prevention and fight against corruption in the public sector.  The main objective is to set up a regular reporting process so as to ensure that standards in such areas are met and satisfactorily fulfilled and to assist Romania in remedying weaknesses pointed out by the CVM.   Progress reports of 2014 and 2015   The  2014 report  presents the EC’s analysis of the steps Romania has taken since the 2012 and 2013 reports (the latter was published after the nomination of a new government).  The main conclusion of the 2014 report is that Romania has made  progress in the key judicial and integrity institutions  , even in difficult political circumstances.  However, the report points out:   specific problems regarding judicial independence;   resistance to applying integrity and anti-corruption measures;   political interference in key judicial appointments.   The  2015 report  also shows specific steps taken to address high-level corruption, creating  increased confidence amongst Romanians  about the judiciary and anti-corruption prosecution.   Main recommendations   The EC invites Romania to consolidate and secure the work done. Whilst the implementation of the Codes (Civil, Civil Procedure, Criminal and Criminal Procedure) has shown productive developments, new steps lie in wait for judicial independence and judicial reform.  Other improvements are necessary to:   ensure integrity to avoid any conflict of interest in public procurement;   create a more efficient and systematic approach in the fight against corruption through prevention and dissuasive sanctions.   The EC also insists on more coherence in Court and Parliament decisions (for example, treating parliamentarians as ordinary citizens).  To support Romania, the monitoring process of the CVM will continue to benefit from EU funds and constructive support from the EC and other EU countries.  See also the  EC Secretariat-General’s website on CVM  , the  Romanian CVM  website and the  2014  and  2015  Commission press releases.   background   In the context of Romania’s accession to the EU in 2007, further progress was asked of this country in areas such as judicial reform and the fight against corruption. A specific framework was established to monitor the progress made by Romania in these areas through the CVM. An equivalent process is under way in regard to  Bulgaria  .  The CVM process is based on an assessment of progress by Romania’s authorities and on information delivered by EU countries, international organisations, independent experts and other sources.
summary of   Council Regulation (EC) No 2531/98 — application of minimum reserves by the European Central Bank    Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 of the European Central Bank on the application of minimum reserves   what is the aim of the regulations   The  Council  regulation and the  European Central Bank (ECB)  regulation set out the rules for the minimum reserve system in the  euro area  ; these require credit institutions established in the euro area to hold deposits on accounts with their national central bank. These are called minimum reserves.   Regulation (EC) No 2531/98 defines the basis for minimum reserves and the maximum permissible ratios between those reserves and their basis.   The ECB may adopt regulations or decisions in this area. On this basis, in its Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003, the ECB specifies:   the institutions that are subject to the minimum reserve requirements;   the composition of the reserve base;   the actual reserve ratios;   the calculation and maintenance of the minimum reserves;   the exemptions; and   the reporting and verification rules.     key points    Institutions subject to minimum reserve requirements    The legislation concerns credit institutions established in the euro area and branches in the euro area of credit institutions established outside the euro area.   The ECB publishes a list of the institutions subject to minimum reserve requirements.    Maintenance periods    The institutions must maintain the required minimum reserves over an average period of 6 weeks, known as a maintenance period.   To help institutions prepare their reserve management, the ECB publishes a calendar of the maintenance periods.    Averaging provision   An institution complies with its reserve requirement if, over the maintenance period, the average daily balances on its reserve account are not less than its reserve requirement. This means that the institution’s capital may fluctuate freely around its reserve requirement, but the average assets of the current account must be at least equal to the reserve requirement over the entire maintenance period.   Calculation of minimum reserves   To determine the amount of the minimum reserves of each institution, its reserve base is multiplied by a reserve ratio. Institutions can deduct a uniform lump-sum allowance of the amount of €100,000 from their reserve requirement.   Reserve base   The reserve base is defined in relation to the institution’s balance sheet before the start of the maintenance period. It is composed of different categories of the institution’s liabilities, e.g. deposits and debt securities.   Reserve ratio   The ECB defines the reserve ratios that apply to the relevant liabilities in the reserve base. It may set reserve ratios between 0 % and 10 %. There may be different reserve ratios for specific liability categories (e.g. deposits with agreed maturity over 2 years or deposits redeemable at notice over 2 years). In January 2012, the reserve ratio that applies to most of the short-term liabilities on the institutions’ balance sheet was set at 1 %.   Remuneration   To ensure that the minimum reserve requirement is not burdensome and does not hinder the efficient allocation of resources, the national central banks in the euro area pay interest to the institutions on the capital of their minimum reserves.   Exemption   An institution may be exempted from meeting the minimum reserve requirements if:   its banking licence is withdrawn or renounced;   a judicial authority or another competent authority decides to submit it to winding-up proceedings;   it is subject to reorganisation measures;   it is subject to the freezing of funds and/or to other measures that restrict the use of its funds or its access to open market operations or to the standing facilities (monetary policy operations) of the  Eurosystem  ;   the purpose of the minimum reserve system would not be met by imposing reserve requirements on the institution.    Collection and verification of information    The ECB has the right to collect from the institutions the information required to establish the minimum reserves.   The ECB may also verify the accuracy and quality of the information which the institutions provide to demonstrate compliance with the minimum reserve requirements.    Sanctions   The ECB may impose sanctions on an institution that fails to hold all or part of its required minimum reserves.   from when do the regulations apply   Regulation (EC) No 2531/98 has applied since 1 January 1999, except its Article 5 (power of adopting regulations or decisions) which has applied since 27 November 1998.   Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 has applied since 24 January 2004 except its Article 5 (calculation and notification of minimum reserves) which has applied since 10 March 2004.   background    Minimum reserves represent one of the monetary policy instruments available to the Eurosystem.   Their first key function is to stabilise money market interest rates, which is achieved by the averaging provision. They allow credit institutions to handle daily liquidity fluctuations, e.g. those arising from fluctuations in the demand for banknotes.   A second important function is the enlargement of the structural liquidity shortage of the banking system.   The need for credit institutions to hold reserves with the national central banks contributes to increasing the demand for central bank credit, making it easier for the ECB to steer money market rates through regular liquidity-providing operations.

   European network for the protection of public figures     European network for the protection of public figures     The responsibility for protecting public figures against assaults or attacks when visiting the European Union (EU) lies with the EU countries. Due to the growing number of visits to the EU, this decision sets up a European network for the protection of public figures to act as an official communication and consultation channel for national authorities.     ACT     Council Decision       2002/956/JHA      of 28 November 2002 setting up a European Network for the Protection of Public Figures [       See amending act(s)      ].     SUMMARY     The protection of visiting public figures is the responsibility of the host European Union (EU) country. Following a Council recommendation of 6 December 2001 setting a common scale for assessing threats to public figures visiting the EU and an       initiative of Spain      , the Council adopted this decision to close loopholes in the law on the protection of public figures.     This decision sets up a European network for the protection of public figures. The network consists of national police and other competent services dealing with the protection of public figures. Each EU country designates a national contact point for the network. Candidate countries to the EU as well as       Europol      may also designate contact points.     The public figures covered by the decision are those who visit the EU either in an official or non-official capacity and to whom a protection service is assigned under the national law of an EU country or the rules of an international or supranational organisation or institution.     The EU country holding the Presidency of the Council is responsible for promoting the activities of the network.     The objectives of the network are to:      promote the exchange of general and technical information and experience between the national services participating in the network;       promote the development of a set of common best practices for the operational activities of the national services;       promote the reciprocal secondment of national officials;       allow the national services participating in the network to exchange information, communicate and develop common views on procedures and methods relating to the protection of public figures;       encourage the exchange of operational information concerning the application of security when a public figure must be protected in two or more EU countries;       encourage collaboration between the authorities of national protection services on the application of protection when the public figure must be protected in two or more EU countries.      The network must report annually to the Council, which is to evaluate the activities of the network every three years.

   Community strategy for endocrine disrupters     Community strategy for endocrine disrupters     The Commission has developed a strategy to deal urgently with the problem of endocrine disrupters which damage health and the environment.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 17 December on a Community strategy for endocrine disrupters [       COM(1999) 706      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY      Context      The phenomenon of endocrine disrupters is not new. Recently, however, it has attracted significant media attention and has become a cause for public concern. Some Member States have already introduced measures to limit or prohibit certain suspected substances. Though considerable research still needs to be carried out in this area, growing public concern and the various research results already available confirming the problems linked to these substances have prompted the Community to act urgently to address the problem.      Definition      The endocrine system consists of a set of glands and the hormones they produce, which help guide the development, growth, reproduction and behaviour of animals, including human beings. Endocrine disrupters are agents which appear to interfere with (or "disrupt") the functioning of this system.     Natural hormones, synthetically produced hormones and some man-made chemicals are capable of disrupting the endocrine system. The adverse effects of endocrine disrupters on health and the environment appear to relate in particular to exposure to synthetically produced hormones and man-made chemicals. Amongst other things, they impair reproduction and development and cause certain cancers. Cases of impaired reproduction are well documented in a number of species. For instance, the masculinisation of female marine snails has been observed. Endocrine disruption is also particularly marked in wildlife.      Strategy      Existing legislation does not necessarily take account of the adverse effects of endocrine disrupters. In this communication, the Commission proposes a strategy comprising short, medium and long-term action to tackle the problem. It should be noted that much research remains to be done in this area and that there is still no validated test method for establishing definitively whether a substance actually is an endocrine disrupter. The strategy is thus based on existing information but should be flexible enough to incorporate new scientific knowledge.     Similarly, the measures are based on an assessment of the likely timeframe within which results can be achieved, i.e. 1-2 years for short-term actions, 2-4 years for medium-term actions and more than 4 years for long-term action.      Short      -       term measures        Establishment of a priority list for evaluation.        This is a list of substances requiring priority evaluation ("ED priority list") to identify         inter alia        substances which can already be addressed under existing legislation, gaps in knowledge and specific cases of consumer use for special consideration;        Use of existing legislative instruments.        Though the amendment of legislation is a long-term action, efforts can be made to reinforce or speed up the implementation of existing legislation such as the Regulation on         risk assessment        and the Directive on the         classification of dangerous substances        ;        Establishment of monitoring programmes.        The programmes should give an estimation of exposure to the substances on the ED priority list, so that their impact may be studied in terms of dose, timing of exposure, etc.;        Identification of specific cases.        Identifying vulnerable groups exposed to certain substances (e.g. children) and, where those substances are not covered by the existing legislation, examining whether they need to be entered on the ED priority list;        Exchange of information and effective coordination between players.        (Commission, Member States, industry, etc., and at international level);        Full public information.        Informing the public about what is being done, explaining the mechanisms and making information such as the ED priority list public;        Regular consultation of stakeholders.        (Governments, NGOs, industry, etc.).       Medium      -       term measures        Identification and assessment of endocrine disrupters.        Pursuing international cooperation on research to establish validated test methods capable of identifying endocrine disrupters;        Further research and development.        Particularly through the fifth framework programme of research and development;        Encouragement of research into substitutes and voluntary initiatives.        Long      -       term measures        Adaptation/amendment of current legislation to take account of ED.        In particular Regulation (EEC) No         793/93        on risk assessment and Directive         67/548/EEC        on the classification of dangerous substances.      It must also be ensured that other measures, such as legislation to protect the environment (e.g. the       water framework Directive      ) or consumers, take account of endocrine disruption.     RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 14 June 2001 on the implementation of the Community Strategy for Endocrine Disrupters [         COM(2001) 262        final      -       Not yet published]      This communication is the first report on the implementation of the strategy for endocrine disrupters. It examines the progress which has been made and sets out future action.     Regarding short-term measures, in 2000 a priority list was compiled of 553 man-made substances and 9 synthetic/natural hormones. A list was also compiled of priority actions to evaluate the role of these substances. The Commission also organised a workshop on endocrine disrupters from 18 to 20 June 2001 in Sweden.     The Commission is continuing to participate in the OECD Endocrine Disrupter Testing and Assessment Task Force, whose goal is to develop agreed test methods for endocrine disrupters. The latest estimates are that agreed test methods for human health should be available in 2002, with tests for environmental effects expected between 2003 and 2005.     Research into endocrine disruption is a priority of the 5th Community framework programme of research and development. A dedicated call for research proposals was published in May 2001 and an overall budget of 20 million euros has been provided.     Regarding legislative action, the proposed revision of the General Product Safety Directive includes       inter alia      a simplification of conditions and procedures for urgent measures at Community level. In addition, the issue of endocrine disrupters is addressed specifically in the context of new (the water framework Directive) and existing legislation and in the White Paper on a strategy for a future chemicals policy.     Following the preparatory activities carried out in 2000, the year 2001 will be dedicated to detailed evaluation of substances. In 2001-2002, priority will also be given to collecting data, launching research projects and encouraging Member States to speed up the current risk assessment process for existing substances under existing legislation.

summary of   Directive 2004/80/EC — relating to compensation to crime victims   what is the aim of the directive   It sets up a system of cooperation to help victims of crime get  compensation  in situations regardless of where in the European Union (EU) the crime was committed.   The system operates on the basis of EU countries’ national compensation schemes for  victims of violent intentional crime  committed on their own territories.   key points   The directive has two main elements.   It requires all EU countries to have a  compensation scheme  for victims of violent intentional crime committed on their territories. The organisation and operation of such schemes is left to the discretion of each EU country.   It sets up an  EU-wide cooperation system  based on those national schemes.    Guaranteeing adequate compensation   Ensuring adequate compensation for victims can be difficult either because:   the offender does not have the necessary financial resources; or   it has not been possible to identify or prosecute the offender (the possibility of obtaining compensation from the offender is dealt with in  Directive 2012/29/EU  establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime).   The directive requires that victims:   be compensated irrespective of their country of residence or the EU country in which the crime was committed;   receive  fair and appropriate  compensation — the exact amount is left to the discretion of the EU country in which the crime was committed.    Cooperation   All EU countries were required to set up national schemes offering fair and appropriate compensation by 1 July 2005. The directive sets up a system of cooperation between national authorities to facilitate access to compensation for victims throughout the EU:   Victims of crimes committed in an EU country other than the one in which they usually live may ask an authority in the country in which they live (  assisting authority  ) for information on how to apply for compensation.   That national authority then transmits the application directly to the national authority of the EU country in which the crime was committed (  deciding authority  ), which is responsible for assessing the application and paying out the compensation.   All communication must be carried out in the language of the deciding country. The  European Commission  has drawn up  standard forms  for the transmission of applications and decisions relating to compensation to victims.   The directive creates a system of  central contact points  in each EU country to facilitate cooperation in cross-border situations which meet regularly. Additional information is available on the website of the  European e-Justice Portal  .   from when does the directive apply  It entered into force on 26 August 2004. EU countries had to incorporate it in national law by 1 January 2006.   background   For more information, see:    ‘Compensation’  on the European Commission's website.
   Strengthening the European Neighbourhood Policy     Strengthening the European Neighbourhood Policy     After eighteen months of implementation, the Commission is taking stock of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), its instruments and results. This assessment shows that the ENP needs strengthening because of the numerous challenges facing the partner countries. The ENP has potential which could be better utilised to build close relations between EU Member States and neighbouring countries and also to create prosperity, stability and security along Europe's borders.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on strengthening the European Neighbourhood Policy [       COM(2006) 726      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     After eighteen months in operation, the ENP has shown that it offers a solid basis for strengthening ties between the EU and its neighbours.     However, the ENP has potential which could be better utilised to boost its impact. The partner countries are faced with several challenges such as poverty, unemployment, mixed economic performance, corruption, weak governance and frozen conflicts in certain regions.     The EU supports and encourages reforms in partner countries with a view to creating prosperity, stability and security in the region, in our mutual interest. The challenges facing our neighbours often go beyond their borders and also concern the EU. In this regard, the EU and its partners have a mutual interest in stability to help combat illegal immigration, environmental degradation and terrorism and to ensure reliable energy supplies.      The strengths of the ENP      The ENP fosters political progress and lays the groundwork for improved dialogue between the EU and its partners by offering:      a single, clear framework for integration which covers all aspects of bilateral relations with our neighbours in global and sectoral terms;       ENP         action plans        mutually agreed by the EU and the partner country concerned to demonstrate joint and individual ownership. Twelve ENP action plans have been established to date. They lend concreteness to the ENP and enable the focus to be on specific, measurable and time-bound objectives. They are based on partner countries' reform strategies and also offer a working basis for certain international financial institutions (IFI);       The European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), to provide financial support for the reform process. Its flexibility should allow for better use of funds and should improve results, in particular through instruments such as cross-border cooperation,         TAIEX        and twinning.       Strengthening the ENP to make full use of its potential.      Full advantage can be taken of the ENP by boosting its resources and by providing an appropriate response to the needs and aspirations of the partner countries. The EU will be repaid for the effort it makes by the political advantages brought by the reforms implemented by the partner countries in their own interest. However, the results of the ENP also depend on the will of the partners which determines the closeness of the relationship with the EU and the level of assistance. The Commission therefore proposed strengthening the policy in December 2006 - the response of the Council is now awaited - by:     Enhancing the economic and trade component, which involves comprehensive and global trade and economic integration. Firstly, the EU supports accessions to the World Trade Organisation (       WTO      ) (for example, Ukraine) and the granting of autonomous trade preferences (for example, Moldova). In the long term, economic integration could go beyond goods and services to encompass comprehensive convergence in trade and regulatory areas (such as technical norms, research, intellectual property rights, company law etc.).     The action plans are excellent means of achieving this and will lead in the medium to long term to a new generation of ambitious and complex, deep and comprehensive free-trade agreements like the one which will be negotiated this year with Ukraine.     They will take into account the impact of trade on sustainable development and will cover products of particular importance to the partner countries. They will be binding. In this connection, the free trade agreements with Mediterranean partners should be extended.     Such agreements will be concluded progressively according to the pace of each country. With a common regulatory basis and a similar degree of market access, the process will, in the long term, favour the emergence of a broader neighbourhood economic community between the EU and its partners as outlined in the Agadir Agreement for the countries around the Mediterranean.     To       facilitate mobility and manage migration      , procedures for issuing visas for certain categories of trip with a legitimate purpose (business, official or educational) should be simplified. Experience of free movement within the EU shows us that the visa procedures may be an obstacle to mobility even though cooperation is increasing.     Amending these procedures requires an examination of all the issues concerned: illegal immigration, combating trafficking and smuggling in human beings, efficient border management, readmission agreements, return of illegal migrants, and adequate processing of requests for protection and asylum. An appropriate response from the partners to these questions would contribute to simpler and faster procedures and to joint efforts on illegal immigration.     Visa facilitation and readmission agreements go some way towards this while being adapted to the specific needs of each country, as in the cases of Ukraine, Moldova and Morocco. These agreements should in particular concern the countries for which the action plan stipulates a dialogue on the issues of migration and visas. Moreover, developments in the EU in this area such as the creation of a visa information system may also be useful.      Promoting people-to-people exchanges      gives the ENP a "human face" distinct from the mobility issue. These involve contact and opportunities for contact between citizens of the EU and the partner countries. They also encourage mutual knowledge and understanding. The ENP will also gain visibility through bilateral programmes and by exchanging information and experience.     Specifically, people-to-people exchanges include:      educational and youth exchanges, a core element aimed at building bridges and overcoming prejudices within the EU. University cooperation will be supported through the         Tempus        and         Erasmus Mundus        programmes and a new scholarship scheme. Modernisation and reforms will benefit from improved political dialogue on higher education. Dissemination and exchange of best practices will enable cooperation and convergence with EU policies such as the         Bologna Process        . Assistance for education reform will be strengthened, in particular through the European Training Foundation (         ETF        ). A new ENP programme could also be envisaged to promote exchanges among young professionals in the field of culture and the arts, as well as among regulators.       mobility of researchers to increase scientific cooperation and improve excellence by increasing grants for mobility and information;       civil society exchanges for economic, social, cultural and inter-cultural purposes to build bridges in many areas (contacts among trade unions, town-twinning, health and NGOs). Cross-border cooperation under the ENPI will be one of the instruments. Furthermore, increased participation by civil society in the reform process will be encouraged;       strengthening of contacts between firms, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).       The thematic dimension of the of the ENP      requires a multilateral approach for the cross-cutting areas which are of common interest to the EU and all its partners, such as energy, transport, the environment, the information society, research, public health and migration etc.     Besides in-depth scrutiny and debate on each topic, various informal methods of addressing them could also be used, such as ad hoc or more regular ministerial or expert level meetings. The existing multilateral agreements such as the       Energy Community Treaty      and the aviation agreements could be extended. In general, the purpose of developing a horizontal dimension of the ENP is not to create new institutions but to find ways to boost cooperation with the partner countries in particular areas. Participation by partners in certain programmes and Community agencies is another means of achieving this.     The       strengthening of political cooperation      will help to resolve conflicts and deal with the associated risks (escalation or an exodus of refugees, interruption of energy supplies or cutting of trade and transport links, the spread of terrorism and organised crime etc.) The security and stability of Europe is at stake and the association of Russia is encouraged.     The EU participates in regional and multilateral conflict resolution in forums such as the Quartet for Peace in the Middle East and in civil or military observation, peace-keeping or border management operations like those in Moldova or Rafah. The       stability instrument      could strengthen the role of the EU. Moreover, further resources should be devoted to sustainable development.     The ENP offers opportunities through improved dialogue, development support and regional cooperation. It could also provide a basis for the development of other means such as alignment with CFSP Declarations offered to all ENP partners, invitation of partners to briefing and coordination meetings held by international organisations, an informal high-level meeting to launch the enhanced ENP, intensified parliamentary cooperation or a greater EU presence in partner countries (diplomatic missions in Member States and to the European Union, Commission Delegations).     The aim of       improving regional cooperation      is to take advantage of the potential for dialogue and cooperation at ENP regional level, with the support of the ENPI:      improved cooperation in the Black Sea region ("Black Sea Synergy"), (Commission communication adopted 11 April 2007) together with a strengthened ENP regional strategy should provide favourable conditions for conflict resolution. All the interested parties, including Russia and Turkey, should be associated. Sectoral issues will be addressed through scientific cooperation, political dialogue or existing regional organisations like the         International Commission for the Protection of the Black Sea        . The         Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organisation        (BSEC) provides a useful platform for closer relations and improved regular dialogue between the EU and the countries concerned. Regional cooperation should take account of other regional initiatives, such as the         Baku Initiative        in the transport and energy fields.       in the Mediterranean region, the ENP has just boosted dialogue and regional integration through a         Europe-Mediterranean partnership        . It inspired the work programme (         PDF        ) adopted at the 2005 Barcelona Summit and strengthened bilateral relations according to respective situations and interests. The action plans in force have already proved their worth (reforms, progress in sensitive areas, establishment of unitary dialogue on various points, setting of common priorities) and the action plans for Egypt and the Lebanon adopted at the beginning of 2007 provide the ENP with a regional dimension. The ENP will enable synergies to be sought in certain economic sectors, for example with the         Gulf Cooperation Council        .      The ENP also offers a possibility of strengthening regional cooperation outside the immediate neighbouring area of the EU, with "our neighbours' neighbours" (Central Asia, the Gulf, Africa). Cooperation activities will focus on regional issues of common interest such as energy, transport, migration, infrastructure, peace and security etc., with the support of the ENPI and the Development Cooperation Instrument (       DCI      ). They should also attract investment in development and modernisation of these countries.      Enhanced financial cooperation      will be funded by financial instruments which contribute to political objectives, such as, first and foremost, the ENPI, which has replaced the       TACIS      and       MEDA      programmes, and will also benefit from the new extended mandate of the European Investment Bank (       EIB      ). With increased assistance, the ENPI provides a flexible framework tailored to the ENP's priorities. Other cooperation instruments will also be available under the ENP, particularly in the areas of       human rights      , nuclear safety and thematic programmes.     Improvement of coordination between the various donors will help to strengthen financial cooperation. This depends on the mobilisation of investments and looking for synergies between Community funds, Member States and financial institutions     ENPI facilitates the mobilisation of funds through its financing mechanisms based on the priorities identified in the action plans, including:      The Governance Facility which aims to assist the reform process in partner countries based on their action plan;       Neighbourhood Investment Fund (NIF). This fund is used to support IFI lending in the Member States. It will allow more coherence and complementarity between Community assistance and that of the Member States.       Background      The ENP was launched to promote good relations between the enlarged EU and its neighbours. To avoid the emergence of new dividing lines, the EU has an interest in promoting prosperity, stability and security among its neighbours by working with them to support their transition. The ENP does not offer the prospect of accession to partner countries but nor does it prejudice the development of relations with the EU.     RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 4 December 2006 on the "General Approach to enable ENP partner countries to participate in Community agencies and Community programmes" [         COM(2006) 724        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      This proposal concerns the means by which the various Community agencies and programmes could be opened to neighbouring countries. In its conclusions of March 2007 (       PDF      ), the General Affairs and External Relations Council accepted this proposal and the Commission is in the process of preparing negotiating directives on the various programmes.

summary of   Council recommendation on sharing of information on terrorist kidnappings   summary    what does this recommendation do   It sets out a procedure for the sharing of experiences between EU countries to help resolve terrorist kidnapping situations.   key points    Terrorist kidnappings pose a huge challenge to EU countries. To successfully resolve such situations, countries need background information, to establish contacts and initiate confidential discussions. Sharing information can quickly identify whether another EU country already has helpful experience with kidnappings in the same region, by the same terrorist group or in similar circumstances.   To achieve this, each EU country is recommended to circulate data sheets to other EU countries on any terrorist kidnapping, after the incident has been resolved.   This information should include:   country and region in which the kidnapping took place;   number and nationalities of the hostages;   time and date of the kidnapping and its conclusion;   responsible terrorist group or perpetrator;   kidnapping method;   motivation for the kidnapping;   any mediator involvement;   contact person in the EU country concerned.     The following additional information should also be supplied where appropriate:   the hostages’ reason for being in the country, their language skills and gender;   the ideology, nationality and language skills of the perpetrators;   means used by the perpetrators to address the public;   details on the perpetrators’ method of operation.     Annexes to the recommendation propose a standard format for this information, as well as suggestions for additional information to be supplied, such as negotiating strategy, delaying tactics and whether ransoms or political demands were involved.   Further information and experience should be shared bilaterally in accordance with national law. Handling of personal data should also be in accordance with national law.   Each EU country should compile information on any incidents occurring since 1 January 2002 and supply a summary to other EU countries. A list of contact persons should also circulate in order to facilitate direct communication.   Information should be shared through the bi-directional link network for EU-wide information sharing on terrorist incidents (see  Council Decision 2005/671/JHA  ). Information should also be shared with  Europol  , with a review after 12 months to determine whether the amount and type of data requires a database.   background   For more information, see:    ‘Crisis and Terrorism’  on the European Commission's website    ‘Fight against terrorism’  on the website of the Council of the European Union   act    Council Recommendation  of 12 June 2007 concerning sharing of information on terrorist kidnappings (OJ L 214, 17.8.2007, pp. 9-12)
   Iceland – Enterprises     Iceland – Enterprises     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM(2011) 666      final – SEC(2011) 1202 final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     In its       2011 Report      the Commission gives a positive assessment of Iceland’s alignment with the European Union (EU)       acquis      due to its participation in the       European Economic Area      (EEA). Preparations for accession must be pursued.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission’s words)      EU       industrial policy      seeks to promote       industrial strategies      which strengthen competitiveness by accelerating adaptation to structural changes and encouraging a framework conducive to the creation and development of enterprises across the EU and to national and foreign investment. It also seeks to improve the overall business environment in which       small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)      operate. It presupposes a process of       privatisation      and       restructuring      (see also Chapter 8 – Competition policy). The Community strategy in this area essentially involves defining fundamental principles and drawing up industrial policy declarations. The implementation of enterprise policy and industrial policy requires an adequate administrative capacity at national, regional and local level.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      In general the country has achieved a high level of alignment in the field of       enterprise and industrial policy      . Specific measures have been adopted concerning industrial policy and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in order to overcome the challenges emerging in the wake of the economic and financial crisis.

   Fostering structural change: an industrial policy for an enlarged Europe     Fostering structural change: an industrial policy for an enlarged Europe     Industry plays a central role in the European Union's efforts to increase competitiveness and meet the Lisbon objectives. This communication provides an analysis of the competitiveness of European industry and the threat posed by deindustrialisation in this new global environment. The Commission aims to establish an industrial policy tailored to the demands of competitiveness, so as to foster the structural changes required by industry in a knowledge-based Europe.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 20 April 2004 "Fostering structural change: an industrial policy for an enlarged Europe" [       COM(2004) 274      final - not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The Commission intends to set out an industrial policy for the European Union (EU) that matches up to the issues facing Europe, particularly the effects of enlargement and international competition. This policy aims to promote competitiveness and encourage more appropriate regulation, so that European industry remains innovative and continues to create jobs and growth.     The Member States and the European institutions must organise the structural changes in European industry around the factors of production of an enlarged Europe and the innovative capacity of a knowledge-based Europe.      No deindustrialisation but necessary structural change      Although the Commission does not see a general process of deindustrialisation at EU level, structural changes are profoundly affecting the industrial landscape. Jobs and resources in labour-intensive sectors or those facing intense competition are being shifted towards sectors where there are comparative advantages. The impact of these structural changes is positive for the EU as a whole, but may be damaging at local level for certain sectors or regions.     However, these shifts in jobs and resources must be backed by measures to promote research and innovation in order to maintain the EU's comparative advantage in sectors with high added value. The pressure of international competition has intensified in recent years, and is affecting more and more industrial sectors. The relocation of jobs to emerging economies no longer affects only traditional labour-intensive sectors; increasingly, its effects are being felt in hi-tech industries and the services sector. The only way Europe will be able to take full advantage of industrial globalisation is by adopting an industrial policy that focuses on competitiveness.      Opportunities afforded by enlargement      The enlargement of 2004 offers European industry significant opportunities, provided that the restructuring of the relevant sectors is not hampered by national protection measures. On the demand side, the internal market has been extended to include booming national consumer markets. On the supply side, companies can reorganise production to benefit from the competitive advantages of the new Member States.     The new Member States have an important role to play in the transition to a knowledge-based economy. Their inclusion can boost the EU's industrial performance and stimulate the internal market in the face of competition from non-member countries. The competitive advantages of the new Member States should make it possible for jobs that would otherwise have been transferred to Asia to be relocated within the EU. The sectors most affected by the arrival of new companies are food and beverages, transport equipment, base metals and metal products.      Tools to foster structural change      The Commission's objective, in line with the priorities set out in the       2002 communication on industrial policy in an enlarged Europe      , is to rally public stakeholders around three areas of action for fostering change in European industry.     The first area of action concerns regulation and all the laws governing industrial activity in the EU. The aim is to bring legislation into line with the needs of businesses, both at national and European levels. Particular attention should be paid to competitiveness and to analysing the combined effects of different regulations on each sector of activity.     The second goal is to ensure that EU measures in different areas that have an impact on industry, particularly research, competition, employment and regional development, are better coordinated. The Commission intends to use these different policies to improve productivity gains and promote the use of knowledge. In more general terms, greater synergy between the EU's different policy areas will boost the competitiveness of European businesses.     The third target concerns the sectoral dimension of EU industrial policy. The Commission aims to make EU industrial activity more visible in key sectors by involving interested parties, thus highlighting the added value of industrial policy at European level.      Background      This Communication forms part of the debate on how industrial policy can contribute to improving industrial competitiveness, launched by the       Commission's communication of 11 December 2002      . It should help European industry meet the objective the EU set itself at the       2000 European Council in Lisbon      .

summary of   Decision (EU) 2016/1623 on the signing and provisional application of the Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and EU countries, of the one part, and the SADC EPA states, of the other part    Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and EU countries, of the one part, and the SADC EPA states, of the other part   what is the aim of the decision and of the agreement  They aim to encourage development by establishing free trade relations between the European Union (EU) and the 6 countries concerned.   key points   The Southern African Development Community (SADC) consists of:   Botswana;   Lesotho;   Mozambique;   Namibia;   South Africa; and   Eswatini.    Pro-development orientation    The agreement is an ‘asymmetrical’ agreement. The EU guarantees Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, and Swaziland  duty-free   *   and quota-free   *   access  to the EU market. It also grants South Africa  enhanced market access  beyond the previous agreement.   The agreement does not require the SADC countries to match the market access granted to them by the EU. SADC may  maintain tariffs on certain products  to protect them from international competition.   Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) countries can  increase import duties  if imports from the EU increase so much or so quickly that they threaten to disrupt domestic production.   The EU cannot use agricultural export subsidies.   The agreement promotes  economic diversification  by reducing import duties on ‘intermediate’ products, such as seeds, fertilisers and machinery, with the aim of making such products more accessible to African entrepreneurs.    Geographical indications    EU producers of  traditional products  with a worldwide reputation, e.g. wines and food products, have the exclusive right to use their traditional names in South Africa.   Several South African ‘geographical indications’ are protected on the EU market, such as different types of wine and rooibos tea.    Sustainable development    All parties are required to uphold social and environmental standards.   The agreement establishes a  consultation procedure  for environmental or labour issues and defines a comprehensive list of areas for  cooperation  between the partners to foster  sustainable development  .   from when do the decision and the agreement apply  Pending the entry into force of the Agreement between the EU and all the SADC, the Agreement applies provisionally as from 10th October 2016 between the European Union and the Republic of Botswana, the Kingdom of Lesotho, the Republic of Namibia, the Republic of South Africa and the Kingdom of Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) as indicated in the notice (see related documents below) and as from 4 February 2018 between the European Union and the Republic of Mozambique (see relevant notices under 'related documents' below).  The provisional application excludes Article12(4), dealing with the support of the EU countries to development cooperation in the SADC EPA which was already applicable.  Decision (EU) 2016/1623 has applied since 1 June 2016.   background   For more information, see:    Southern African Development Community (SADC)  on the European Commission's website.

act   Council Regulation (EU) No  642/2014  of 16 June 2014 establishing the Shift2Rail Joint Undertaking.   summary   The Shift2Rail Joint Undertaking (S2R JU) is a public-private partnership created to coordinate and manage European Union (EU) research and innovation in the rail sector. Based in Brussels, it seeks to implement the EU’s  Horizon 2020  research and innovation programme to build EU leadership in rail technologies.   what does this regulation do  It establishes the S2R JU until 31 December 2024. It describes the JU’s objectives and tasks, its structure and organisation, as well as its funding.   key points   It is the technological component of the  single European railway area  . It seeks to achieve a more competitive and resource-efficient EU transport system and to address issues, such as rising traffic demand, congestion, security of energy supply and climate change.   Objectives   S2R deals with all rail research and innovation activities co-financed by the EU in accordance with the following general objectives that contribute to:        —     the implementation of Horizon 2020, particularly part of the  smart, green and integrated transport challenge  ;            —     the achievement of the single European railway area;            —     a faster and less costly transition to a more attractive, user-friendly (including for persons with reduced mobility), competitive, efficient and sustainable rail system;            —     the development of a strong and globally competitive rail industry.      It plays a major role in rail-related research and innovation. It manages all EU rail-related research and innovation actions as well.   Master plan   S2R draws up and implements a strategic  master plan  addressing five themes:        —     cost-efficient and reliable trains, including high-speed and high-capacity trains;            —     advanced traffic management and control systems;            —     cost-efficient and reliable high-capacity infrastructure;            —     IT solutions for attractive railway services; and            —     technologies for sustainable and attractive European freight.      This plan is translated into results-oriented  annual work plans  with detailed investment plans.   Research andinnovation actions   The JU supports research and innovation mainly through grants to its members and other participants by means of procurement or the award of grants following calls for proposals.  The  rules for participation and dissemination  of the Horizon 2020 programme apply to the S2R JU.   Organisation and operation   The partnership comprises the European Commission and Alstom, Ansaldo STS, Bombardier, Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles (CAF), Network rail, Siemens and Thales & Trafikverket. The  JU  is a form of legal entity created for the purpose under Article 187 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  The JU comprises:        —     a governing board in charge of strategic decision-making; and            —     an executive director responsible for day-to-day management.      The European Commission and the industrial JU members have equal voting rights in the governing board. There are also two advisory bodies: a Scientific Committee and a states representatives group.  S2R JU encourages the involvement of railway equipment makers, infrastructure managers, railway companies, metro, tram and light rail operators, conformity assessment bodies, professional staff associations, user associations, relevant scientific institutions and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).  The  European Railway Agency  (ERA) also advises the JU and provides expertise on interoperability and safety issues.   Budget   The EU financial contribution to the S2R JU amounts to a maximum of €450 million from Horizon 2020. To access this funding, the rail industry has to commit to a contribution of at least €470 million, so that the entire estimated budget of the S2R JU is at least €920 million for the period 2014-20.  Additional funds may be allocated from other EU instruments, such as the  Connecting Europe Facility  , to support actions for the deployment of products that have been developed by the S2R JU and show promising results.   when does this regulation apply  This regulation applies from 7 July 2014.

   White Paper on services of general interest     White Paper on services of general interest     Presented as an extension of the Green Paper on services of general interest, the Commission White Paper describes the European Union's strategy for promoting the development of high-quality services of general interest. It presents the main elements of a strategy aimed at ensuring that all citizens and enterprises in the Union have access to high-quality and affordable services of general interest.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 12 May 2004 entitled "White Paper on services of general interest" [       COM(2004) 374      final - Not yet published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This White Paper presents the Commission's conclusions following a broad       public consultation      launched on the basis of the Green Paper. The consultation showed up significant differences in points of view and outlook. Nevertheless, a consensus seems to have emerged on the need to ensure the harmonious combination of market mechanisms and public service missions. The White Paper sets out the Commission's approach in developing a positive role for the European Union in fostering the development of high-quality services of general interest and presents the main elements of a strategy aimed at ensuring that all citizens and enterprises in the Union have access to high-quality and affordable services.     In submitting this White Paper, the Commission does not intend to close the debate that has developed at European level. Its aim is to make a contribution to the ongoing discussion and take it further by defining the Union's role and a framework that allows these services to function properly.      SERVICES OF GENERAL INTEREST: AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF THE EUROPEAN MODEL AND A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION      The White Paper stresses the importance of services of general interest as one of the pillars of the European model of society and the need to ensure the provision of high-quality and affordable services of general interest to all citizens and enterprises in the European Union. In the Union, services of general interest remain essential for ensuring social and territorial cohesion and for the competitiveness of the European economy.     While the provision of services of general interest can be organised in cooperation with the private sector or entrusted to private or public undertakings, the definition of public service obligations and missions remains a task for the public authorities at the relevant level. The relevant public authorities are also responsible for market regulation and for ensuring that operators accomplish the public service missions entrusted to them.     In this context, the White Paper states that responsibility for services of general interest is shared between the Union and its Member States. This shared responsibility is the concept underlying       Article 16 of the EC Treaty      , which confers responsibility upon the Community and the Member States to ensure, each within their respective powers, that their policies enable operators of services of general economic interest to fulfil their missions. The right of the Member States to assign specific public service obligations to economic operators and to ensure compliance is also implicitly recognised in       Article 86(2) of the EC Treaty      .     The EC Treaty gives the Community a range of resources to ensure that users have access to high-quality, affordable services of general interest in the European Union. The Commission takes the view that its powers are appropriate and sufficient for the maintenance and development of effective services throughout the Union. Nevertheless, it is primarily for the relevant national, regional and local authorities to define, organise, finance and monitor services of general interest.      THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF THE COMMISSION'S APPROACH      The Commission's approach is based on a number of principles that are reflected in the Community's sectoral policies and can be clarified on the basis of the results of the debate on the Green Paper:       Enabling public authorities to operate close to citizens:        The Commission respects the essential role of the Member States and of regional and local authorities in the area of services of general interest. The Community's policies on services of general interest are based on various degrees of action and the use of various instruments, in line with the principle of subsidiarity.        Achieving public service objectives within competitive open markets:        An open and competitive internal market, on the one hand, and the development of high-quality, accessible and affordable services of general interest, on the other, are compatible objectives.        Ensuring cohesion and universal access:        The access of all citizens and enterprises to affordable, high-quality services of general interest throughout the territory of the Member States is essential for the promotion of social and territorial cohesion in the European Union, including the reduction of obstacles caused by the lack of accessibility of the outermost regions.        Maintaining a high level of quality, security and safety:        The Commission wishes to guarantee, in addition to the supply of high-quality services of general interest, the physical safety of consumers and users, everyone involved in the production and delivery of these services and the general public, and, in particular, provide protection against possible threats such as terrorist attacks or environmental disasters.        Ensuring consumer and user rights:        These include, in particular, access to services, in particular cross-border services, throughout the territory of the Union and for all groups of the population, affordability of services, including special schemes for persons on low incomes, physical safety, security and reliability, continuity, high quality, choice, transparency and access to information from providers and regulators.        Monitoring and evaluating performance:        The Commission takes the view that systematic evaluation and monitoring is vital for maintaining and developing high-quality, accessible, affordable and efficient services of general interest in the European Union. The evaluation should be multidimensional and focus on all the legal, economic, social and environmental aspects. It should also take into account the features of the sector evaluated and situations specific to the various Member States and their regions.        Respecting the diversity of services and situations:        The diversity of services must be maintained because of the different needs and preferences of users and consumers resulting from different economic, social, geographical or cultural situations. This is true in particular for social services, health care and broadcasting.        Increasing transparency:        The principle of transparency is a key concept for the development and implementation of public policies regarding services of general interest. It ensures that public authorities can exercise their responsibilities and that democratic choices can be made and are respected. The principle should apply to all aspects of delivery and cover the definition of public service missions, the organisation, financing and regulation of services, as well as their production and evaluation, including complaint-handling mechanisms.        Providing legal certainty:        The Commission is aware that the application of Community law to services of general interest could raise complex issues. It is therefore going to pursue an ongoing project to improve legal certainty associated with the application of Community law in the provision of services of general interest. It has already accomplished the modernisation of the existing public procurement rules and launched initiatives in the areas of state aid and public-private partnerships.       NEW APPROACHES FOR A COHERENT POLICY      One of the main questions in the public discussion concerned the need for a framework directive on services of general interest. The views expressed on this subject in the public consultation were divided, a number of Member States and the European Parliament being sceptical on the issue.     It is therefore uncertain whether a framework directive would be the best route to follow at this stage and would bring sufficient added value. Consequently, the Commission concludes that it would be best not to present a proposal for the time being. Rather, it will pursue and develop its sectoral approach by proposing, where necessary and appropriate, sector-specific rules that allow account to be taken of the specific requirements and situations in each sector.     The Commission will re-examine the feasibility and necessity of a framework law on services of general interest when the Constitutional Treaty comes into force, in particular the new legal basis introduced by Article III-122 which states that: "Without prejudice to Articles III-55, III-56 and III-136, and given the place occupied by services of general economic interest as services to which all in the Union attribute value as well as their role in promoting social and territorial cohesion, the Union and the Member States, each within their respective powers and within the scope of application of the Constitution, shall take care that such services operate on the basis of principles and conditions, in particular economic and financial, which enable them to fulfil their missions. European laws shall define these principles and conditions." In addition, the Commission will review the situation of services of general interest in the European Union and the need for any horizontal measures in 2005. It plans to present a report of its findings by the end of 2005.     On the basis of the results of the public consultation, the Commission also considers it necessary to further clarify and simplify the legal framework for the financing of public service obligations. It intends to adopt a package of measures to that effect by July 2005 at the latest. Most elements of this package have already been submitted as drafts for consultation.     Furthermore, the public debate highlighted the need for a clear and transparent framework for the selection of undertakings entrusted with a service of general interest. The Commission intends to examine the EU legislation ensuring the transparent award of service concessions. It has therefore launched a consultation on the procurement aspects of public-private partnerships.     The Green Paper also generated considerable interest among stakeholders in the area of social and health services, who expressed a need for greater predictability and clarity to ensure a smooth development of these services. The Commission takes the view that it is useful to develop a systematic approach in order to identify and recognise the specific characteristics of social and health services of general interest and to clarify the framework in which they operate and can be modernised. This approach will be set out in a Communication on social services of general interest, including health services, to be adopted in the course of 2005.     Evaluating the operation of the services, at both Community and national level, is essential to ensure the development of high-quality services of general interest that are accessible and affordable in an environment undergoing constant change. The Commission has undertaken to intensify and improve its evaluation activities in the field of services of general interest.     On an internal level, the sectoral regulations put in place at Community level concern the large network industries. In the Commission's view, the public consultation on the Green Paper has confirmed this approach. It will take into account the results of this consultation in the examinations of the various sectors.     On an international level, the Commission is determined to ensure consistency between the Community's internal rules and the obligations on itself and the Member States pursuant to international trade agreements. It also wishes to promote services of general interest in development co-operation.     RELATED ACTS      European Parliament Resolution of 13 January 2004 on the Green Paper on services of general interest [A5-0484/2003].      Parliament welcomes the Commission Green Paper and calls on the Commission to present a follow-up by April 2004 at the latest. It takes the view that certain services of general interest should be excluded from the scope of the competition rules, including health, education and social housing, as well as services of general interest aiming to maintain or increase plurality of information and cultural diversity. Moreover, Parliament calls on the Commission to defend this position at WTO negotiations and negotiations on the General Agreement on Trade in Services. It considers that it is neither possible nor relevant to draw up common definitions of services of general interest, or of the public-service obligations resulting from them, but that the European Union must lay down common principles, including the following: universality and equality of access, continuity, security and adaptability; quality, efficiency and affordability, transparency, protection of less well-off social groups, protection of users, consumers and the environment, and citizen participation, taking into account circumstances which are specific to each sector. It stresses the need to ensure that competition rules are compatible with public service obligations, and is opposed to liberalisation of the water supply. Parliament takes the view that water and waste services should not be subject to Community sectoral directives, but that the Union should keep its full responsibility for these sectors as regards quality and environment protection standards.      Commission Green Paper of 21 May 2003 on services of general interest [         COM(2003) 270        final - Official Journal C 76 of 25.03.2004].      The Commission, in this Green Paper, undertakes to conduct a complete review of its policies on services of general interest. Its objective is to organise an open debate on the global role of the Union in the definition of the objectives of general interest pursued by these services and on how they are organised, funded and evaluated. The Green Paper also reaffirms the significant contribution of the internal market and competition rules to modernising and improving the quality and efficiency of many public services, to the benefit of Europe's citizens and businesses. It deals with globalisation and liberalisation, raising the question of whether a general legislative framework should be established at Community level for services of general interest, and seeks to deal with these issues by asking questions about: the impact of any additional Community initiatives to implement the treaty, in full respect of the principle of subsidiarity; the principles likely to be incorporated in any framework legislation on services of general interest and the actual added value of legislation of that kind; the definition of good governance in the organisation, regulation, funding and evaluation of services of general interest; an examination of any new measure likely to be taken to increase legal certainty and facilitate consistent, harmonious coordination between the objective of safeguarding high-quality services of general interest and the rigorous application of the competition and internal market rules.

summary of   Directive 92/83/EEC — harmonised structures of excise duties on alcohol and alcoholic drinks    Directive (EU) 2020/1151 amending Directive 92/83/EEC   what is the aim of the directive   Directive 92/83/EEC  sets out the EU rules for:   excise duties on alcohol and alcoholic drinks;   the categories of alcohol and alcoholic drinks subject to excise duties; and   the basis on which the duty is calculated.    Amending Directive (EU) 2020/1151  was adopted:   to update and clarify some of the rules of Directive 92/83/EEC that had resulted in unnecessarily burdensome administrative procedures for both tax administrations and businesses;   to update the rules allowing EU countries to apply reduced rates on certain alcoholic products;   to ensure the uniform application of the conditions for fixing excise duty on beer, for which it is necessary to lay down conditions for measuring the degrees Plato  *  and to ensure a smooth transition to a harmonised methodology for its measurement.   key points     Beer    Under  Directive 92/83/EC    The excise duty levied on beer is based on the number of  hectolitre/degrees Plato  or on the number of hectolitre/degrees of alcohol by volume of finished product.   EU countries may divide beers into categories consisting of no more than 4 degrees Plato and may charge the same rate of duty per hectolitre on all beers in each category.   Reduced rates of excise duty can be applied to beer brewed by small, independent breweries, as long as those rates:   are not applied to brewers producing more than 200,000 hl of beer per year;   are not more than 50% below the standard national rate of excise duty.     Reduced rates must apply equally to beer delivered into that country from small breweries situated in other EU countries.   Reduced rates, which may fall below the minimum rate, can be applied to weaker beers, i.e. those with a maximum alcoholic strength by volume of 2.8% vol. (increased to 3.5% vol. from 1 January 2022, by amending Directive (EU) 2020/1151).   For  sweetened or flavoured beer  , amending  Directive (EU) 2020/1151  lays down a harmonised approach for measuring the degrees Plato. This is to ensure that the ingredients of the beer added  after fermentation  are taken into account for the purpose of measuring the degrees Plato. The amending directive allows EU countries which, on 29 July 2020, had not taken into account the ingredients of the beer added after fermentation for the purposes of measuring the degrees Plato, to continue to use the currently applied methodology for a transitional period until 31 December 2030.    Wine, other fermented drinks and intermediate products    In relation to these products,  Directive 92/83/EEC  sets the following rules.   The duty levied on  still and sparkling wine and other fermented drinks  (e.g. cider and perry) and intermediate products (e.g. port and sherry) is based on the number of hectolitres of the finished product.   EU countries must levy the same rate of duty within each category of drink.   A reduced rate of excise duty can be applied to  any type of wine and other fermented drinks  with a maximum alcoholic strength by volume of 8.5% vol.   EU countries may apply a  single reduced rate  to intermediate products with a maximum alcoholic strength by volume of 15% vol. if this rate is:   not more than 40% below the standard national rate;   not less than the standard rate applied to still wine and other still fermented drinks.     Amending Directive (EU) 2020/1151 allows:   EU countries to apply  reduced rates of duty  to  wine  produced by independent small wine producers within the following limits:   the reduced rates must not be applied to undertakings producing on average more than 1,000 hl or, in the case of Malta, on average more than 20,000 hl of wine per year   the reduced rates must not be set more than 50% below the standard national rate of excise duty;     EU countries to apply  reduced rates of duty to  independent small producers within the following limits:   up to 15,000 hl for  other fermented beverages  and   up to 250 hl for  intermediate products  .       Spirits    The main rules under  Directive 92/83/EEC  are the following.   The duty levied on pure alcohol and spirit drinks is calculated per hectolitre of pure alcohol, when measured at a temperature of 20°C.   Reduced rates may be applied to ethyl alcohol (ethanol) produced by small distilleries producing up to 10 hl of pure alcohol per year; however, this may not be more than 50% below the standard national rate of excise duty.   EU countries must apply any such reduced rates equally to ethanol originating from small distilleries in other EU countries.   With regard to spirits,  Directive (EU) 2020/1151  amends the rules allowing certain EU countries to apply a reduced rate to ethanol produced in fruit growers’ distilleries from fruit (such as apples, pears, grape marc and berries).    Exemptions    Under conditions that EU countries lay down to ensure their correct and straightforward application and to prevent any evasion, avoidance or abuse, Directive 92/83/EEC permits products to be exempt from excise duty if they are:   denatured  *  in accordance with the requirements of any EU country;   denatured and used to make products not intended for human consumption;   used to produce vinegar, medicines, foodstuffs or food flavourings.   From 1 January 2022,  amending Directive (EU) 2020/1151  :   requires EU countries to exempt from excise duty completely denatured alcohol which was completely denatured in another EU country, in accordance with the method authorised by that other country;   permits EU countries, under a number of conditions, to exempt from harmonised excise duty products covered by Directive 92/83/EEC when they are used in the manufacture of food supplements (under Directive  2002/46/EC  relating to food supplements — see  summary  );   clarifies the procedures for the notification of changes to the requirements for the complete denaturing of alcohol.     Introduction of a new common certification system for independent small producers of all types of alcohols and alcoholic drinks     Amending Directive (EU) 2020/1151  :   introduces a  common certification system  in the EU for confirming the status of independent small producers, recognisable in all EU countries;   gives the  European Commission  the power to adopt  implementing acts  setting out the detailed rules concerning this certificate.    List of excise duties rates   Twice a year, the Commission publishes a  full list of excise duty rates  in force in EU countries.   from when do the directives apply   Directive 92/83/EEC has applied since 10 November 1992 and had to become law in the EU countries by 31 December 1992.   Amending Directive (EU) 2020/1151 has to become law in the EU countries by 31 December 2021. EU countries must apply the rules of the directive as of 1 January 2022.   background   For more information, see:    Excise duty on alcohol  (  European Commission  )    Excise duties on alcohol, tobacco and energy  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Degrees Plato:  the number of degrees Plato measures the percentage in weight of the original extract per 100 grams of beer. This value is calculated from the actual extract and the alcohol contained in the finished product.   Denatured alcohol:  ethyl alcohol made unfit for drinking by adding one or more chemicals to it.
   Placing taxation at the service of research and development     Placing taxation at the service of research and development     This Communication provides guidance to help Member States improve their R&D tax treatment and help develop mutually consistent solutions to common problems.     ACT     Commission Communication of 22 November 2006 to the Council, the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee: "Towards a more effective use of tax incentives in favour of R&D" [       COM(2006) 728      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     In line with its commitment to promote a more consistent and favourable tax environment for R&D, while recognising national prerogatives, the European Commission, through this new Communication, intends:      to clarify the rules on the compatibility of tax incentives with Community law;       to identify good practices in designing tax incentives for research;       to present a number of possible future initiatives aimed at improving consistency in Europe with regard to questions of common interest to do with the taxation of R&D.       Community law and R&D tax incentives      This section focuses on the legal parameters for all R&D tax incentives and provides guidance on the design features of such incentives to avoid incompatibility with Community law.     Territorial restrictions       *      are the main reason why such incentives are incompatible with Community law. They can be explicit       *      or implicit       *      restrictions. In practice, any territorial restriction, whether explicit or implicit, has, in the Commission's view, to be regarded as infringing upon the fundamental freedoms (freedom of establishment, freedom to supply services) laid down in the EC Treaty.     However, certain restrictions may, under certain conditions, be justified:      either by virtue of exemptions expressly provided for by the Treaty (see Articles 46 and 55);       or on grounds recognised as "overriding requirements in the general interest".      The Commission identifies a number of arguments already invoked by the Member States in defence of their territorial restrictions before the Court of Justice of the European Communities (ECJ):      fiscal supervision;       loss of tax revenue;       prevention of tax avoidance;       promotion of national R&D and competitiveness.      To sum up existing case law, there is ample evidence that territorial restrictions on the application of R&D task incentives are unlikely to be accepted by the ECJ. Thus, when designing R&D tax incentives, Member States should take into account the fact that any explicit, and in some cases implicit, form of territorial restriction would not be considered to be in accordance with the EC Treaty. This does not, however, preclude territorial restrictions which simply reflect the territoriality of the tax competence of Member States. For example, a wage tax or social security incentive for R&D personnel might, by its nature, be limited,       de facto      , to persons performing R&D activities in the Member State in which they are taxed or pay social security contributions.     Another aspect to be taken into consideration is the compatibility of tax incentives with Community state aid rules. According to Article 87 (formerly Article 92) of the EC Treaty, "any aid granted by a Member State or through state resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, be incompatible with the common market".     Tax incentives may constitute state aid if they:      meet the criteria laid down in Article 87;       are covered by the relevant case law of the ECJ;       do not fall under the         de minimis Regulation        .      One of the main criteria for determining whether or not a tax incentive       *      constitutes state aid is its selectivity.     Since exemptions are possible, the Commission will assess state aid for research, development and innovation (RDI) that is brought to its attention, and in particular R&D tax incentives, in the light of the Community framework for state aid for research, development and innovation. It also calls on Member States to take into account this framework when designing R&D tax incentives.      Good design features for R&D tax treatment and incentives      In recent years, a growing number of Member States have introduced some form or other of R&D tax incentive. Currently, 15 Member States have acted. Experience has shown that there is no single answer as to how R&D tax incentives should be designed and implemented as circumstances differ from one country to another (general tax policy, industrial structure, level and nature of private-sector R&D performance, etc.),     Nevertheless, despite these differences, a number of guiding principles can be defined.     The tax incentives must:      reach more firms;       include all current expenses;       consider certain types of R&D-related capital expenditure.      It is essential:      to focus on ascertaining the direct additionality of tax incentives and their behavioural additionality;       to consider evaluation criteria and data from the design stage;       to test,         a posteriori,        the impact of incentives, the efficiency of the delivery mechanism and their wider societal effects.      The detailed guidance annexed to the Communication has been drawn up on the basis of the work of an expert group under the aegis of the Scientific Advisory Committee to the European Council and the Commission (CREST). The Commission will continue to promote the sharing of experience and good practices by setting up a network of national experts in 2007.      Guidelines for tackling problems of common interest      In addition to the need for Member States to take into account the fundamental principles set out above, the Commission sheds light on a number of desirable initiatives for reconciling tax policy and the       knowledge economy      at EU level.     The Commission calls on Member States to discuss the introduction of a consistent tax framework that:      is conducive to supporting large-scale transnational R&D projects;       is favourable to young innovative enterprises;       promotes philanthropic funding of research;       facilitates cross-border mobility of researchers;       facilitates cross-border outsourcing of R&D within the EU;       simplifies VAT rules and their application to R&D as regards public entities;       lays down a common tax definition of R&D;       provides for R&D tax treatment in the common consolidated corporate tax base (CCTB).       Background      Against the background of the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy, at the beginning of 2005, the European Union (EU) set a target of 3% of GDP for R&D spending by 2010, of which two thirds should come from the private sector. The trend to provide more favourable tax treatment for R&D is becoming more common in the Member States. However, the growing diversity of R&D tax incentives risks further fragmenting the fiscal landscape but could be prejudicial to transnational cooperation within the EU.          Key terms used in the act                Territorial restrictions: measures or factors that, explicitly or implicitly, favour domestically performed R&D over that performed elsewhere in the EU.                 Explicit territorial restriction: this may be, for example, a legal provision which restricts the benefit of an R&D tax incentive to activities performed domestically.                 Implicit territorial restriction: this includes, for example, a tax incentive covering the costs of subcontracted R&D but limiting the proportion of R&D that can be subcontracted to non-resident entities.                 Selectivity of the tax incentive: a tax incentive is considered selective if its potential beneficiaries are restricted notably in terms of size (e.g. SMEs), location or sector and, as such, is likely to constitute state aid.

summary of   Communication (COM(2011 748 final) — Action plan against the rising threats from antimicrobial resistance   what is the aim of the action plan  It presents a complete approach to tackle the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance  *  . In line with the European Union (EU)  ‘One Health’ initiative  , this covers areas such as human and veterinary medicine, the keeping of animals, agriculture, trade and the environment. EU ministers gave political approval to a further set of measures in June 2016.  This action plan was replaced by the ‘  European One Health Action Plan against antimicrobial resistance  ’, adopted in 2017 (see the relevant  summary  ).   key points   The antimicrobial resistance (AMR) action plan aims to:   make sure antimicrobials are used appropriately in both humans and animals;   prevent microbial infections and their spread;   develop new effective antimicrobials or alternatives for treatment;   cooperate with international partners to contain the risks of AMR;   improve monitoring and surveillance in human and animal medicine;   promote research and innovation;   improve communication, education and training.   The action plan set out 12 specific actions to meet the 7 goals. These ranged from improving the prevention of infections in hospitals to strengthening AMR surveillance systems.  An  evaluation  of the 2011-2016 action plan, released in February 2016, found that:   monitoring and surveillance activities had greatly improved;   antimicrobials sold for animal use had fallen overall in the EU since 2011;   sales of antibiotics for humans had stabilised;   considerable progress had been made in research and innovation;   the  European Commission  was supporting national authorities in encouraging good practice in public and animal health services;   legislative proposals on  veterinary medicine  and  medicated feed  (2014) and on a new  animal health law  (published in 2013 and adopted in 2016) should help tackle AMR;   the action plan has served as a symbol of EU political commitment and stimulated actions within EU countries   In June 2016, EU countries gave political approval to a wide-ranging strategy to tackle AMR. This called on:   EU countries to   have a national anti-AMR action plan in place by mid-2017;   involve all relevant ministries in its development and implementation;   set measurable goals to reduce infections in humans and animals;   raise awareness among consumers, animal-keepers and relevant professionals;   encourage drug companies to develop new products;     EU countries and the Commission to   develop a new and comprehensive EU action plan on antimicrobial resistance based on the ‘One Health’ approach;   act against the illegal trade and use of antimicrobials;   strengthen cooperation between national authorities, the Commission and other relevant sectors including human and veterinary medicine, food, environmental and research;   develop EU guidelines on prudent human use of antimicrobials;   ensure the EU has a common approach in  global AMR discussions  ;     the Commission to   support EU countries in their efforts;   report to EU countries once a year on implementation of the AMR action plan.     background    AMR is a natural phenomenon, but excessive and inappropriate use of antimicrobial medicines on humans and animals, and poor infection controls, have made it a serious worldwide health threat.   AMR has a direct impact on human health and the economy. In the EU, 25,000 people die each year from infections due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The infections result in extra healthcare costs and productivity losses of at least €1.5 billion annually.   For more information, see:    Action at EU level  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Antimicrobial resistance (AMR):  ability of microorganisms to resist antimicrobial treatment, especially antibiotics.
   A stronger partnership to deliver market access     A stronger partnership to deliver market access     The Commission proposes a stronger partnership with European companies and Member States to deliver market access. It is setting priorities and calling for efficient and transparent market access tools.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 18 April 2007: "Global Europe: a stronger partnership to deliver market access for European exporters" [       COM(2007) 183      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     In today's global economy, market access significantly influences the economic strength of European companies and exporters. Establishing an efficient commercial policy is indispensable for growth and employment and ensures that European companies remain competitive and have genuine market access.     In the interest of fair competition, emerging economies must further open their markets and bring down their barriers to trade. The European Union (EU) is prepared to do the same in order to promote competition and innovation and attract foreign investment.     Given that progressive market liberalisation leads to positive results for both developed and developing countries, the EU is prioritising its commitments to the World Trade Organisation (       WTO      ) and the       Doha Development Agenda      . However, a renewed policy, focused on specific problems and markets, is needed.     The Commission proposes a stronger partnership with Member States and European businesses with a view to establishing a clearer, more results-oriented approach. This partnership must focus on:      specific problems encountered in third-country markets;       identifying weaknesses in the current system;       how EU policy must change to reflect a changing global economy.      The Commission plans to decentralise the current system, rendering it more efficient and transparent, and make better use of local knowledge and initiative through the development of specialist EU teams made up of representatives from the Commission, Member States and companies. Finally, it calls for Community priorities to be defined in order to focus on the most pressing challenges.      Market access in a changing global economy      The trade barriers in today's global economy are:      tariff barriers and burdensome customs procedures;       restrictions on access to raw materials;       barriers to trade in services and to foreign direct investment;       restrictive government procurement practices;       unfair or discriminatory fiscal practices (reliance on State aid, subsidies and methods in breach of WTO trade defence rules such as the         anti-dumping measures        );       misuse of unjustified measures concerning health, safety and technical regulations;       poor protection and inadequate implementation of intellectual property rights (IPR).      These barriers to trade are complicated and difficult to detect. Non-tariff and other "behind-the-border" barriers are increasingly important. Many market access problems now arise because existing rules are not correctly implemented. Only better coordination between Member States, businesses and the Commission can make it easier to detect, analyse, assess and eliminate them.      Stakeholders' support for change      Consultation of the stakeholders confirmed that market access requires stronger action at Community level and a more results-oriented approach. The recommendations include:      improving the mix of policy instruments;       engaging actively in multilateral and bilateral negotiations;       taking steps to ensure that agreements are enforced;       maximising results though closer cooperation between the Commission, Member States and businesses;       better prioritising of action against barriers to trade;       offering businesses a more efficient and transparent service;       eliminating barriers to trade in goods and services, intellectual property and investment.       The right mix of policy instruments to deliver market access      We cannot rely on a single avenue or mechanism to tackle trade barriers. Although the WTO system and multilateral cooperation are still the best way to guarantee market access, we must use formal and informal multilateral and bilateral instruments. In the WTO, successful completion of the Doha round is the EU's priority. The scope for using accession negotiations to secure greater market access is constantly diminishing, as the most important trading countries have now joined the WTO (China) or are about to do so (Russia). Multilateral cooperation will thus be strengthened by the launch of new negotiations on bilateral Free Trade Agreements with ASEAN, Korea, India, the Andean and Central American countries, as well as by the continuation of talks with Mercosur and the Gulf Cooperation Council.     Rights under the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding should be actively pursued, taking advantage of flexible dispute avoidance and resolution mechanisms based on mediation. To this end, complaints against violation of bilateral treaties will be included in the Trade Barriers Regulation.     The EU's position in international standardisation bodies will be reinforced, giving it greater influence in international cooperation.     However, compliance with the rules is largely dependent on administrative capacities, training instruments and technical infrastructures. The Commission and the EU are therefore committed to increasing trade-related assistance in order to reduce these constraints. The Commission also proposes to encourage third countries to use notification procedures to lift trade restrictions.     Finally, it reaffirms the increasingly important role played by political contacts and international diplomacy, in addition to other policy instruments, in tackling barriers to trade.      Towards a stronger partnership      The Commission proposes the establishment of a new partnership with Member States and European businesses. These trilateral discussions will lead to the identification of better ways of working with a view to:      establishing priorities for action in removal of trade barriers;       linking up databases;       developing a network of market access specialists.      Commission delegations, Member States' embassies and European businesses operating abroad are best placed to:      identify the problems encountered;       determine whether coordinated action with different specialists is required;       conduct local follow-up.      The efficency of this joint effort depends on contacts and systematic cooperation, making it possible to improve information collection, identify legislative proposals and use local knowledge.     In Brussels, the "Market Access" Advisory Committee is tasked with:      promoting the exchange of best practice;       enhancing coordination;       working closely with the Trade Barriers Regulation Committee.      Although the overall advisory committee on trade policy (133 Committee) remains the main forum for discussion, other specialist committees will continue to play an important role. The Commission will discuss market access issues on a regular basis with the European Parliament.      Establishing priorities      Given the increasing complexity of trade barriers, making them more difficult to detect and remove, we need to focus on the highest priorities, namely:      economic benefits in the short and the medium term for EU businesses;       barriers representing a serious infringement of an agreement;       resolution of the problem within a reasonable timeframe.      Priorities will be defined in terms of countries, sectors and categories of problem.     However, prioritisation must not be a straitjacket; rather it must provide guidance for using resources better.      A more effective and transparent service      A prevention-based "early warning" approach allows potential barriers to be identified and tackled at source and means that any concerns are made known before draft regulations or legislation are set in stone. The main challenge is the time needed to successfully remove barriers. European businesses need quicker, more responsive action. The Commission therefore proposes to improve and streamline the way it registers, analyses and tackles complaints.     It is the role of European businesses to provide much of the information on barriers to market access. The Commission's role is to ensure that this information is shared by registering the complaints received in the Market Access Database and establishing web-links with other databases for greater accessibility. This database, which is available on line, provides rapidly accessible and reliable information with regard to applied tariffs, trade barriers, import formalities and documentary requirements for imports. The Commission is launching a promotional campaign in and with the Member States to raise the profile of the database and encourage European companies to register their complaints. Cases will be given a unique registration number to facilitate their tracking through the system in a transparent manner. Moreover, the Commission undertakes to update the information available on the database and develop new sections over time to improve its coverage in areas such as services, IPR enforcement and investment. The Commission is currently looking at ways to link the Market Access Database and the Helpdesk for Developing Country Exporters.      Conclusions      A stronger partnership to deliver market access is needed to achieve a global Europe and represents a significant contribution to the Lisbon agenda for growth and jobs. The success of the current initiative will depend on:      the strength of the new partnership;       the allocation of sufficient resources;       optimum use of resources.      The Commission is committed to taking up this challenge and calls for the participation of all interested parties.     Further information on the       DG External Trade      website.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 1889/2005 — controls of cash entering or leaving the EU   what is the aim of the regulation  It complements the rules of Directive (EU) 2015/849  on prevention of the use of the financial system  for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing within the EU.   key points    Obligation to declare    The regulation places an obligation on any individual entering or leaving the EU and carrying cash  *  of a value of €10,000 or more to declare that sum to the competent authorities  *  . The information provided must be correct and complete, otherwise the declaration is invalid.   The declaration is provided in writing, orally or electronically, to be determined by the EU country, and must contain information on:   the declarant, including full name, date and place of birth and nationality;   the owner and the amount and nature of the cash;   the intended recipient of the cash;   the provenance and intended use of the cash.     The information obtained, either from the declaration or as a result of controls, must be recorded and processed. It is made available to the authorities responsible for combating money laundering or terrorist financing in the EU country of entry or of exit. The information provided may be communicated to non-EU countries by the EU countries or by the  European Commission  , subject to the consent of the competent authorities. The national and EU rules on the transfer of personal data must be complied with.   Professional secrecy covers all information which is by nature confidential or which is provided on a confidential basis. It must not be disclosed without the express permission of the person or authority providing it. However, the competent authorities may be obliged by law to disclose this information, for instance in connection with legal proceedings. In such a case, any disclosure or communication of information must fully comply with prevailing data protection legislation.    Checking compliance with the obligation to declare    Officials of the competent authorities may check compliance with the obligation to declare by carrying out controls on individuals. This includes controls on the individuals themselves, their baggage and their means of transport. All controls must comply with national legislation in this area.   In the event of failure to comply with the obligation to declare, cash may be detained by administrative decision in accordance with national legislation.   The information obtained may be made available to other EU countries, in particular where there is evidence of illegal activities. In such cases, Regulation (EC) No 515/97 on  mutual assistance  between the administrative authorities of the EU countries and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters applies. Where there are indications that the financial interests of the EU are adversely affected, the information must also be transmitted to the Commission.   Where it appears from the controls that an individual is entering or leaving the EU with sums of cash lower than €10,000 and where there is evidence of illegal activities associated with the movement of cash, that information may also be recorded and processed.    Penalties   By 15 June 2007, EU countries were required to introduce effective and proportionate penalties constituting a deterrent in the event of failure to comply with the obligation to declare.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 15 June 2007.   background   For more information, see:    Cash controls  (  European Commission  )   key terms    Cash:  covers currency (banknotes and coins), but also other monetary instruments such as cheques, promissory notes, money orders, etc.   Competent authorities:  the customs authorities of the EU countries or any other authorities empowered by EU countries to apply this regulation.
summary of   Directive 98/29/EC — export credit insurance for transactions with medium and long-term cover   what is the aim of the directive   It harmonises different national official export credit insurance systems  *  to ensure there is no distortion of competition between EU companies.   It establishes common principles for insurance coverage, premiums, country cover policies and notification procedures.   key points    The legislation applies to  insurance cover for the export of goods and services  . All institutions providing the cover, either directly or indirectly, must comply with its terms.   The  risks covered  may be commercial, political, manufacturing or credit-related.    Insurers are liable  if the loss is directly or indirectly due to various causes such as a debtor’s insolvency or political or economic developments.    Insurers are not liable  for any loss that may be due to factors such as:   behaviour or omissions by the policyholder; or   the failure of subcontractors to fulfil their obligations.      Claims  should be paid without any delay, or, at the latest, within 1 month of the waiting period  *  .    Premiums  should:   correspond to the country, sovereign, public and/or private risk covered;   reflect adequately the scope and quality of the cover granted;   be able to cover long-term operating costs and losses.      Country cover policy  should reflect an assessment of the risks involved, notably a country’s total outstanding exposure and/or the value of new contracts to be covered.    Notification procedures  designed to ensure transparency in the system apply to:   annual notification for information;   notification for a decision;    ex-ante  and  ex-post  notification for information.     The legislation  does not apply  to insurance cover for:   bids;   advance payments;   performance or retention bonds  *  ;   locally used construction equipment and material.     from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 8 June 1998. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 1 April 1999.   * key terms     Export credit insurance systems:  these protect an exporter of products and services against the risk of non-payment by a foreign customer. In giving the exporter conditional assurance that payment will be made if the foreign buyer is unable to pay, they reduce the payment risks associated with doing business abroad.     Waiting period:  the period of time set for the covered risk to materialise.     Performance or retention bonds:  bonds that protect a customer once a job or project is completed. They guarantee that the contractor will do any work needed to remedy defects discovered immediately after completion of the contract, even if the contractor has been fully paid.
summary of   Directive 92/106/EEC — common rules for certain types of combined transport of goods between EU countries   what is the aim of the directive   It aims to promote intermodal  *  transport operations by supporting the international operations meeting certain criteria (i.e. so called combined transport or CT) by:   safeguarding CT from national restrictions (authorisation schemes, tariffs and quotas);   clarifying that road cabotage  *  restrictions do not apply to the CT road legs;   allowing heavier and bigger loads for vehicles used in CT road legs;   granting financial support through tax incentives and extended definition of own-account transport for CT operations.     key points    Scope   The directive refers to the CT of goods between EU countries where:   the vehicle or trailer uses the  road  on the initial or final leg of the journey; and   on the other leg,  rail or inland waterway or maritime services  where this section  exceeds 100 km  as the crow flies; and   makes the initial or final road transport leg of the journey:   between the point where the goods are loaded and the nearest suitable rail loading station for the initial leg and between the nearest suitable rail unloading stations and the point where the goods are unloaded for the final leg, or   within a radius  not exceeding 150 km  as the crow flies from the inland waterway port or seaport of loading or unloading.     Authorised dimensions and maximum weights for trucks carrying out cross-border travel are set out in Directive  96/53/EC  (see  summary  ).   Transport document   The transport document to be provided in the case of CT must specify:   the rail loading and unloading stations relating to the rail leg; and   the inland waterway loading and unloading ports relating to the inland waterway leg or the maritime loading and unloading ports relating to the maritime section of the journey.    Cross-border transport    All hauliers established in an EU country who meet the conditions of access to the occupation and access to the market for transport of goods between EU countries may, in the context of a CT operation, carry out initial and/or final road haulage legs which form an integral part of the operation and which may or may not include the crossing of a frontier.   The directive sets out specific rules for CT operations where the dispatching/receiving party carries out the initial/final road haulage leg on its own account. The receiving/dispatching party may then also carry out the transport operation on its own account under certain conditions.   Regulation (EC) No  1072/2009  sets out common EU rules for access to the EU haulage market aimed at non-resident hauliers carrying out road cabotage (see  summary  ).   EU countries’ obligations   EU countries must take measures to ensure that the motor vehicle taxes applicable to road vehicles routed in combined transport are reduced or reimbursed.   Review   The  European Commission  must draw up a report to the  Council  every 2 years on the development of CT.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 15 December 1992 and had to become law in the EU countries by 30 June 1993.   background   For further information see:    Multimodal and combined transport  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Intermodal:  the transport of goods using rail, inland waterway or maritime services in addition to road transport.   Cabotage:  where a haulier registered in one EU country carries out national transport in another EU country.
   Agreement between the European Union and the United States on the security of classified information     Agreement between the European Union and the United States on the security of classified information     This Agreement is intended to strengthen the security of the United States and the European Union (EU) and the safety of their citizens. The two parties undertake to develop mutual cooperation via the exchange of classified information and multiple protection mechanisms to ensure the required degree of security.     ACT     Council Decision       2007/274/JHA      of 23 April 2007 concerning the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Government of the United States of America on the security of classified information.     SUMMARY     The United States and the EU agree to develop their cooperation on questions of common interest concerning security and the exchange of classified information. They recognise that effective cooperation requires access to this type of material, and that this type of exchange requires appropriate security measures.     Classified information, which may be in oral, visual, electronic or documentary form, or in the form of material, including equipment and technology, is defined as information:      the unauthorised disclosure of which could damage or harm the interests of the parties;       which needs to be protected against unauthorised disclosure in the security interests of the EU and the United States;       which bears a security classification assigned by one of the parties.      All classified information must be marked with the name of the releasing party and the type of classification. For the United States, the classifications are: "top secret", "secret" and "confidential". For the EU, the classifications are: "très secret UE/EU top secret", "secret UE", "confidentiel UE" and "restreint UE".      Protection of classified information      The two parties are required to:      have equivalent high-level security systems;       provide one another with information about their security standards, procedures and practices;       afford a high level of protection to information received and released.      The recipient:      cannot use the information for any other purpose than the one for which it was provided without the prior agreement of the releasing party;       cannot further release or disclose classified information received;       must comply with any limitations on the release of classified information specified by the releasing party;       must protect the rights of the originator of the classified information, as well as intellectual property rights (e.g. patents, copyright and trade secrets).       Personnel security clearances      Access to classified information is reserved to authorised persons and those whose official duties may require it. The parties will take care that all persons are security-cleared before being given access, and that these persons are aware of their responsibilities.     Security clearance is based on all available information on the individual's loyalty, integrity and trustworthiness, as determined by an appropriate investigation.      Transfer rules      The releasing party ensures that classified information is adequately protected until it reaches the intended recipient. Once in his possession, he is responsible for seeing that it is properly protected.     For the EU, classified information in written form is sent to the Chief Registry Officer of the Council of the European Union, who forwards it to the Member States and the European Commission. As regards the United States, classified information in written form is sent via the Mission of the United States of America to the European Union.     The electronic transmission of classified information is encrypted in accordance with the releasing party's requirements. These requirements must be met when transmitting, storing and processing this information.      Security and technical security arrangement      Each party ensures the security of facilities and establishments where classified information is kept. The releasing party can inspect and verify the security arrangements of the other party's facilities. The host party must assist visiting security representatives in their task. Before any exchange of classified information is made, the authorities responsible for security will decide whether the recipient is able to ensure its security.     Information may be provided to a contractor with the prior written consent of the releasing party. The recipient party will ensure that the contractor has the capability to protect the information.     A technical security arrangement is established to lay down standards for reciprocal security protection of classified information. The authorities responsible for developing this technical security arrangement are:      the US Department of State;       the Security Office of the General Secretariat of the Council (EU);       the European Commission Security Directorate (for the EU, the arrangement is subject to the approval of the Council Security Committee).       Particular cases      Classified information should be downgraded or declassified once it no longer needs protection. The releasing party can downgrade or declassify its own information at its own discretion. The recipient cannot downgrade or declassify information received without the prior written consent of the releasing party.     The releasing party must be informed immediately of any loss or compromise of its classified information. The recipient party investigates the matter and informs the other party of the results.

summary of   Regulation (EU) 2019/127 establishing the European Foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions (Eurofound)   what is the aim of the regulation   It  repeals and replaces  Regulation (EEC) No  1365/75  which, in 1975, established the  European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound)  .   It adapts the rules concerning Eurofound to take into account as far as possible its  tripartite nature  . It is governed by a board comprising representatives of:   EU countries’ governments;   employers and workers of EU countries —  social partners  ; and   the  European Commission  .     key points    Objective   As one of the EU’s  decentralised agencies  , Eurofound’s objective is to support the Commission, other EU institutions and organisations, EU countries and the social partners in shaping and implementing policies concerning:   improving living and working conditions;   devising employment policies; and   promoting dialogue between management and labour forces.   It seeks to meet this objective by:   enhancing and disseminating knowledge;   providing evidence and services for the purpose of policymaking, including research-based conclusions; and   facilitating knowledge-sharing among interested parties at EU and national levels.    Tasks   While fully respecting EU countries’ own responsibilities, Eurofound:   analyses developments and provides comparative analyses of policies and practices in EU countries and, where relevant, other countries;   collects data and analyses trends in living and working conditions, employment and labour market developments;   analyses the developments in industrial relation systems, in particular social dialogue at EU and national levels;   studies and researches relevant socioeconomic developments and related policy issues;   carries out pilot projects and preparatory actions, where requested to do so by the Commission;   provides forums for sharing experiences and information between interested parties at national level;   manages and makes available tools and datasets to policymakers, the social partners, academic bodies and other interested parties;   establishes a strategy for relations with non-EU countries and international organisations concerning matters for which it is responsible.    Organisation   Eurofound, which is based in Dublin, Ireland, has a  management board  , an  executive board  and an executive director.    Management board    It comprises:   1 representative from each EU country;   1 representative of the employers’ organisation for each EU country;   1 representative of the employees’ organisation for each EU country;   3 members representing the Commission;   1 independent expert appointed by the  European Parliament  .   The board’s  main functions  are to:   provide Eurofound’s strategic direction;   adopt Eurofound’s programming document;   adopt Eurofound’s budget;   adopt rules of procedure (including those of the Executive Board), financial rules, rules on preventing and managing conflicts of interest and an anti-fraud strategy;   appoint the Executive Director.   The Board elects, by a majority of two-thirds, a chairperson and 3 deputy chairpersons representing the various interests. Their term of office is 1 year and renewable.  It may establish  advisory committees  in line with the policy priority areas outlined in Eurofound’s programming documents.    Executive board    The executive board assists the management board by:   preparing its decisions;   monitoring, together with the management board, any follow-up to findings and recommendations stemming from internal or external audit reports, and  OLAF  investigations;   advising the executive director in the implementation of management board decisions, in order to reinforce the supervision of administrative and budgetary management.     Executive director    The executive director is responsible for:   Eurofound’s  management  and the implementation of Eurofound’s  tasks  and  budget  ;   drawing up a draft programming document containing a  multiannual  and an  annual  work programme in line with Regulation (EU) No  1271/2013  on the financial rules adopted by the EU’s agencies and bodies.    Work programmes   The draft programming document is submitted to the management board for its approval and then submitted to the Commission, the European Parliament and the  Council  before 31 January each year.   The  multiannual work programme  sets out:   overall strategic programming, including objectives;   expected results and performance indicators;   resource programming including multiannual budget and staff.     The  annual work programme  must be consistent with the multiannual work programme and comprises:   detailed objectives and expected results, including performance indicators;   a description of the actions to be financed, including planned measures to increase efficiency;   an indication of the financial and human resources allocated to each action;   possible actions for relations with non-EU countries and international organisations.     Both programmes  must avoid overlaps  with work carried out by other EU agencies. Eurofound coordinates closely with 2 other tripartite agencies: the  European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA)  and the  European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop)  .    Budget   Estimates of all revenue and expenditure for Eurofound must be prepared each financial year and shown in Eurofound’s budget. The budget must be balanced in terms of revenue and expenditure.   Its  revenue side  comprises:   a contribution from the EU’s general budget;   voluntary financial contributions from EU countries;   charges for publications and any service provided by Eurofound;   any contribution from non-EU countries involved in Eurofound’s work.     Its  expenditure side  includes:   staff remuneration;   administrative and infrastructure expenses;   operational expenditure.      Evaluation   By 21 February 2024, and every 5 years thereafter, the Commission must ensure that an evaluation is carried out to assess Eurofound’s performance in relation to its objectives, mandate and tasks.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 20 February 2019.   background   For more information, see:    Who we are  (  Eurofound  ).
summary of   Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 — EU regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items   what is the aim of this regulation   It sets out a uniform European Union (EU) system to control the export, transfer, transit and brokering (the work of intermediaries who buy and sell on behalf of others) of dual-use items  *  . This system seeks to ensure that the EU complies with its international commitments and responsibilities, especially regarding non-proliferation (i.e. preventing the spread of nuclear weapons).   It lays down a common EU control list as well as rules for its implementation. An  export authorisation  is required to export a dual-use item from the EU to a non-EU country.   key points    Dual-use items are goods and technology for civilian but also military use, including items that may assist in any way in the manufacturing of nuclear weapons or other nuclear devices.   Trade in dual-use items represents a sizeable portion of the EU’s external trade; the most recent data confirm that the volume of controlled dual-use exports from the EU was up to €85 billion.    EU list of dual-use items    Annex I of the regulation provides a list of dual-use items that require authorisation. Annex I is updated each year to align it with international rules and commitments undertaken by:   the  Australia Group  ,   the  Missile Technology Control Regime  ,   the  Nuclear Suppliers Group  ,   the  Wassenaar Arrangement  on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies and   the  Chemical Weapons Convention  .     Non-listed dual-use items: the export of certain dual-use items not listed in Annex I may be subject to authorisation when there is reason to believe that they are intended for use in connection with a  biological, chemical, nuclear weapons or ballistic missile weapons programme  or for military use in  countries subject to an arms embargo  .   In exceptional cases, EU countries may impose additional controls on non-listed items for  public security  or  human rights  reasons.   EU countries also apply restrictions on  brokering services  of dual-use items as well as on their  transit  through the EU.    Free movement of dual-use items within the EU  : with the exception of some sensitive items listed in Annex IV of the regulation (like electrically driven explosive detonators), dual-use items may be freely traded within the EU.    Export authorisations   There are 4 types of export authorisations, as indicated below.    1.     EU general export authorisations (EUGEAs)  allow the export of certain dual-use items to certain countries and under certain conditions (see Annex II of the regulation). They cover, for example:    exports of some dual-use items to countries such as Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and the United States;   exports of some dual-use items after repair/replacement;   temporary exports of some dual-use items for exhibitions/fairs;   exports of some telecommunications items and chemicals to certain destinations.        2.     National general export authorisations (NGEAs)  may be issued by EU countries if they are consistent with existing EUGEAs and do not refer to items listed in Annex II of the regulation (e.g. uranium or human and animal pathogens such as certain viruses, including Ebola).      3.     Global licences  are issued by national authorities to one exporter and may cover multiple items to multiple countries or end users.      4.     Individual licenses  are issued by national authorities to one exporter and cover exports of one or more dual-use items to one end user or consignee in a non-EU country.      Network of export control authorities   The regulation sets up a network of competent export control authorities, coordinated by the Dual-Use Coordination Group, which exchanges information on export controls and develops tools to support its implementation.   The export control policy review    The regulation requires the  European Commission  to conduct a review of EU export control policy. In October 2013, the Commission presented an implementation and impact assessment report to the Parliament and the European Council. It concludes that the current export control regime, while providing solid legal and institutional foundations, should be upgraded in order to generate the modern control capabilities the EU will need in future.   In April 2014, a  communication  was adopted outlining a long-term vision for EU strategic export controls and identifying concrete policy options for the modernisation of the export control system. In 2015, the Commission conducted  an impact assessment  and presented a  legislative proposal  for a modernisation of EU export controls in September 2016.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 27 August 2009.   background   For more information, see:    ‘Dual-use export controls’  on the European Commission's website.   * key terms     Dual-use items:  items that can be used for both civil and military purposes, such as uranium that can be used both in power generation and in nuclear weapons.
summary of   Council Decision 2014/401/CFSP — on European Union satellite centre   what is the aim of the decision  It repeals Joint Action  2001/555/CFSP  , which established SATCEN, and  consolidates  previous amendments and additional proposed changes into a single new decision.   key points    SATCEN headquarters continue to be in Torrejón de Ardoz, Spain. However, this decision establishes a liaison office in Brussels.   This decision reaffirms that SATCEN operations are in the context of the EU’s  common foreign and security policy  (CFSP) and, in particular, the  common security and defence policy  (CSDP).   The  Political and Security Committee  (PSC) of the  Council of the EU  exercises political supervision over the activities of SATCEN. The  High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy  is responsible for the operational direction. The SATCEN board is responsible for the annual and long-term programmes and the appropriate budget.   SATCEN is responsible for the residual administrative tasks, such as administering pensions, medical insurance and employee disputes, for employees of the dissolved  Western European Union  (WEU)  *  .   Under this decision, primarily through Earth observation satellites, SATCEN offers geospatial intelligence products and services to users that request it, such as the  European external action service  , individual EU countries, the  European Commission  or international organisations such as the  United Nations  or  NATO  .   Every September, the SATCEN director, who is appointed by the board for the duration of 3 years, establishes an annual work programme. This annual work programme, as well as the long-term work programme and the budget, must be approved by the board. The board is composed of a representative appointed by each EU country and the European Commission and chaired by the High Representative.   By 31 July 2019, the High Representative of the EU must present a report and, if necessary, recommendations, to the Council of the EU on the functioning of SATCEN.   from when does the decision apply  It applies from 26 June 2014.   background   Satellites are essential for strengthening early warning  *  and crisis monitoring functions in the context of security and defence. Here, the EU takes action to strengthen its satellite centre (SATCEN) for such purposes.  For more information, see:    European Union satellite centre  .   key terms    WEU:  an international organisation and military alliance consisting of 10 EU countries. It became dormant in November 2000, when its tasks were transferred to the European Union’s  CSDP  , which is a key element of the EU’s agreed foreign policy  (CFSP)  . The WEU was dissolved in 2011 and its residual administrative tasks were transferred to SATCEN.   Early warning:  the tracking of indicators to identify potential problems at an early stage.
summary of   Decision 2003/174/EC - Tripartite Social Summit   summary    what does this decision do  It establishes the Tripartite Social Summit, a forum for discussion between the EU institutions and employers’ and workers’ representatives (  ‘social partners’  ).   key points    Role   The Summit is part of  cross-industry dialogue  . It is designed to provide a continual exchange between social partners and the EU institutions and to ensure that social partners contribute to the EU's economic and social strategy.  In this context, these social partners also collaborate closely with the  Employment Committee  which advises the  Commission  and in particular national ministers on the  Employment and Social Affairs Council  .   Agenda   The agenda:        —     is determined jointly by the representatives of the institutions and the social partners            —     includes issues affecting all economic sectors and workers within the EU.       Participants   The EU institutions are represented by:        —     the  Council Presidency  and the  2 subsequent Presidencies  , and            —     the Commission;      The social partners are divided into two delegations of each size comprising:        —     10 workers' representatives, and            —     10 employers' representatives.      It is jointly chaired by the  President of the Council  and the  President of the Commission  .   Timing   It takes place at least once a year, before the spring European Council.   from when does the decision apply  From 6 March 2003.   act   Council Decision  2003/174/EC  of 6 March 2003  establishing a Tripartite Social Summit for Growth and Employment   REFERENCES           Act     Entry into force     Deadline for transposition in the Member States     Official Journal       Decision  2003/174/EC      6.3.2003     -      OJ L 70, 14.3.2003, pp. 31–33
act   Communication from the Commission: Energy efficiency: delivering the 20 % target (  COM(2008) 772 final  of 13 November 2008).   summary   European Union leaders agreed in March 2007 to reduce the EU’s projected energy consumption by 20 % by 2020. That is the equivalent of closing 400 power stations. In October 2014 they agreed a higher energy savings* target of 27 %, or greater, by 2030.   what does the communication do  It analyses the progress the EU has already made in moving towards greater energy efficiency* and identifies the drivers and barriers that exist. It also sets out details of the energy efficiency package that the Commission plans to present.   key points   The package contains the following measures.   Existing legislation on energy efficiency in buildings will be extended to cover more premises. The Commission believes 30 % less energy use in the sector is feasible.   Labelling legislation requiring details of a product’s energy use will apply not just to existing household appliances, but also to commercial and industrial energy-using and related products, such as windows and motors used in buildings.   New energy labelling legislation will be tabled to encourage the use of fuel-efficient tyres. These require less force to turn the steering wheel and so consume less fuel.   Existing measures on the combined generation of electricity and heat (cogeneration) will be strengthened.   Subsequently, in 2011, the Commission proposed an  energy efficiency plan  to ensure the 20 % reduction target is met and to help move towards a resource-efficient and low-carbon economy by 2050.  In 2012 the EU adopted a new  energy efficiency directive  . This laid down rules for the more efficient supply and use of energy and laid down indicative national energy efficiency targets.   background   Using energy more efficiently has many benefits. It can help households and businesses lower their fuel bills, reduce Europe’s reliance on external suppliers of oil and gas, combat climate change and make the EU’s economy more sustainable and competitive.  For more information, see the European Commission’s ‘  Energy and environment  ’ website.   key terms    Energy efficiency  : using less energy to provide the same service. Examples: energy efficient fridges, washing machines.   Energy saving  : reducing or going without a service to save energy; Example: turning off a light.
   Telemedicine systems and services     Telemedicine systems and services     Telemedicine systems and services should benefit patients and health professionals in all Member States of the European Union (EU). The Commission and Member States are working together to adapt the existing legislative and regulatory frameworks and to overcome the technical constraints on the development of these systems.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 4 November 2008 on telemedicine for the benefit of patients, healthcare systems and society [       COM(2008) 689 final      – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Telemedicine systems make it possible to transmit medical information at a distance by means of       Information and Communication Technologies       (ICTs)      . They are intended for exchanges between health professionals or between health professionals and their patients.     They are used for the       diagnosis,       treatment       and       follow-up of patients      . As a result, these systems help to improve the quality and effectiveness of care. They are currently used in medical monitoring and radiology for the electronic transmission of information or images.     Telemedicine is of major importance in the context of an ageing European population. In particular, its use makes it possible to       optimise the resources      available to health centres and to increase exchanges of information between professionals. It is also an economic sector with great potential for development.     The Commission proposes a series of       strategic actions      at European and national levels in order to extend the application of telemedicine.     The Commission is to adopt       guidelines      intended to demonstrate the benefits, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of telemedicine services to users, systems and health authorities. These guidelines should be based on scientific studies and the results of pilot projects, particularly in the context of the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme.     The Commission encourages Member States to       work together to identify their needs and priorities      in the area of telemedicine. Their national strategies are to be presented at the 2010 Inter-Ministerial Conference on Health.     The Commission is to develop a       clear legal framework      for medical acts carried out by means of telemedicine systems. By 2011, Member States should adapt their regulatory frameworks applicable to licensing, professional liability, jurisdiction and the administrative practices relating to reimbursements. Privacy and patient safety must be guaranteed.     The Commission is to establish a       European platform of support      to facilitate exchanges of information between Member States. It is also to publish an analysis of the Community legal framework applicable to these services.     All European patients should benefit from telemedicine services through the       development of broadband connections      . In addition, it is necessary to improve interoperability and network standardisation for the development of the cross-border provision of healthcare services in the single market.     In 2011 the Commission is to present a strategy paper on the interoperability, quality and security of telemonitoring systems.      Background      This Communication follows consultation held in 2007 and 2008 with health professionals, patients and representatives of undertakings in the sector. It is part of the European e-Health Action Plan aimed at improving the quality of health care through the use of new technologies.     Last updated: 12.12.2008  
   eAccessibility     eAccessibility     This communication encourages the Member States to step up their promotion of initiatives to give improved access to information and communication technologies, particularly for people with disabilities and the elderly.     The aim is also to foster industry self-regulation in this area.     ACT     Communication from the Commission, dated 13 September 2005, on "eAccessibility" [       COM(2005) 425      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     "eAccessibility" refers to initiatives taken to ensure that all citizens have access to Information Society services. This is about removing the technical, legal and other barriers that some people encounter when using ICT       *      -related services. In particular, it concerns people with disabilities and certain elderly people.     It is also about encouraging such people to use ICT and the Internet, and making them aware of the prospects the latter can open up for them.     The barriers to ICT accessibility relate in particular to:      the lack of Europe-wide standards (e.g. there are seven different, incompatible text phone systems for deaf and hard-of-hearing persons);       the lack of adequate services, and especially of websites that visually impaired persons can read and navigate through easily;       the lack of products and services for certain groups of persons (e.g. telephone communication for sign language users);       the lack of interoperable         *        solutions for accessible ICT;       the lack of accessible content;       the incompatibility of software with assistive devices (e.g. screen readers for blind users).      Many of these barriers could be removed. However, this requires firm cooperation, coordination and determination at European level.      ONGOING ACTIVITIES AT EUROPEAN LEVEL      A number of eAccessibility measures are under way at European level.      Accessibility requirements and standards      European standards on e-Accessibility would contribute to the proper functioning of the European single market. This would promote the development of new markets, competitiveness and employment.     The Commission therefore intends to continue to provide financial support for the activities proposed by the European standardisation organisations in the framework of the European Standardisation Action Plan.      Design for All (DFA)      DFA       *      involves a more thorough consideration of accessibility requirements when a product or service is being designed. It is now well established, though not yet widely practised. It is therefore essential to continue raising awareness of and promoting DFA in Europe. To this end, the Commission has set up a network of centres of excellence (EDEAN), which has over one hundred members.      Web accessibility      A 2001 Commission Communication on the accessibility of public websites (       COM(2001) 529      final) was followed by Council and Parliament resolutions in 2002. As a result, Member States have undertaken to make their public websites accessible in accordance with international guidelines. An eAccessibility Experts Group is enabling the Commission and the Member States to monitor developments. In addition, a European Committee for Standardisation workshop is exploring adequate solutions for devising accessibility certification schemes.      Benchmarking and monitoring      To be able to further develop appropriate European eAccessibility policies it is essential to have European data comparable across Member States. The Commission will build upon the ongoing European monitoring activities, taking account of the revised Lisbon       *      approach.      Research      Almost 200 European research and technological development (RTD) projects undertaken since the early 1990s have improved accessibility by increasing our knowledge of the problems involved and the solutions required.     The current proposal for the 7th framework programme addresses the need to pursue and expand RTD in eAccessibility.      THREE PROPOSED NEW APPROACHES      In addition to promoting ongoing measures, the Commission intends to foster the use of three approaches not yet widely used in Europe.      Award of public contracts      The European Public Procurement Directives specifically mention the possibility of including accessibility requirements in conditions for tender. Some Member States already include accessibility requirements in their public procurement.     There is a clear need for consistency of accessibility requirements in public procurement in Europe. To this end, the Commission is preparing a mandate to the European standardisation organisations to develop European accessibility requirements for public procurement of products and services in the ICT domain. The Commission will also encourage debate on this subject with the Member States in the framework of the eAccessibility Expert Group.      Certification of accessibility      A number of standards exist or are under development defining how products and services can be made accessible. However, at present there is no reliable means to assess the conformity of products with those standards.     Certification schemes for accessibility would provide guidance to customers and clients who want accessible products and services. They would also provide manufacturers and service providers with recognition for their efforts.     With this in mind, the Commission will study the possibilities for the development and introduction of certification schemes. The possibility of self-declaration or third-party certification will also be investigated and the different options will be compared for their effectiveness.      Better use of existing legislation      The eAccessibility potential of existing European legislation needs to be fully exploited. Several European directives have clauses which could be used to encourage eAccessibility (e.g. the       Employment Equality      Directive, the Directive on       Radio and Telecommunication Terminals      and the       Public Procurement      Directive).      Background      This Communication on eAccessibility contributes to the implementation of the recently launched "       i2010 - A European Information Society for growth and employment      " initiative. It incorporates the main findings of a consultation held in 2005 which showed that the accessibility of online services and products should remain a political priority for the EU in relation to ICT.       Key terms used in the act         Information and communication technologies (ICT): the term ICT covers a wide range of services, applications, technologies, devices and software, i.e. tools like telephony and the Internet, distance learning, television, computers, and the networks and software needed to use these technologies. These technologies are revolutionising social, cultural and economic structures, resulting in new ways of behaving towards information, knowledge, working life, etc.         DFA: the DFA methodology denotes the design of products and services to be accessible to as broad a range of users as possible.         Interoperability: the ability of two or more systems (devices, databases, services or technology) to interact with one another in accordance with a prescribed method.         Lisbon Strategy: at the European Council in Lisbon (March 2000), the EU set itself a new strategic goal for the next decade: "to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion." The Lisbon Strategy was revised in March 2005 to refocus its priorities on growth and jobs.

summary of   Directive 2009/45/EC on safety rules and standards for passenger ships    Directive (EU) 2017/2108 amending Directive 2009/45/EC on safety rules and standards for passenger ships   what is the aim of the directive  It aims to introduce uniform safety standards for people’s lives and property on  passenger ships  and  high-speed craft  , such as hydrofoils, used in domestic voyages in  EU  waters (i.e. between ports in the same EU country).  While it was originally intended as a  codification  of Directive  98/18/EC  , it was decided instead to  recast  the 1998 directive. Directive 2009/45/EC thus repeals and replaces Directive 98/18/EC.  In 2017, following a review of the directive under the  regulatory fitness and performance programme  initiative (known as REFIT), Directive (EU)  2017/2108  was adopted. It amends Directive 2009/45/EC and clarifies and simplifies the rules and standards for passenger ships.   key points    Scope   The legislation applies to passenger vessels made of steel or an equivalent material and to high-speed passenger craft.   Passenger vessel classification and areas of operation   Passenger vessels are divided into 4 classes (A, B, C and D) according to the sea areas they may operate in.  EU countries publish the list of sea areas and classes of vessel concerned, including any restricted periods, in a publicly available database.   Technical safety requirements   The legislation sets out detailed technical requirements on safety measures vessels must respect, such as:   construction;   stability;   machinery;   electrics;   fire protection and life-saving.   National authorities may have additional safety requirements if they consider that specific local circumstances merit them.   Inspections and safety certificates    Each passenger vessel registered in an EU country is inspected before it enters into service and at least once a year after that.   All passenger vessels that meet the safety standards are given an annual passenger ship safety certificate.   National authorities must apply penalties that are ‘effective, proportionate and dissuasive’ for any breach of the safety standards.    Exclusions   The legislation does not apply to certain types of vessels, such as:   warships;   primitive wooden ships;   original or replica historical passenger ships;   yachts with fewer than 12 passengers;   vessels used exclusively in ports.    Amending Directive (EU) 2017/2108   This amending directive:   excludes from the scope of Directive 2009/45/EC   all existing and new passenger craft shorter than 24 metres — which will be subject to nationally defined safety standards (in May 2018, the  European Commission  presented a  proposal  to coordinate safety rules for small passenger ships of less than 24 metres in length)   offshore maintenance vessels carrying workers to and from offshore installations and ship-carried tenders used to transfer more than 12 individuals from a passenger ship to the shore and back   pleasure craft, and traditional boats and sailboats if they are equipped with additional mechanical propulsion;     simplifies the definitions of maritime zones C and D;   classifies passenger ships (A, B, C and D) depending on the sea area in which they can operate;   requires ships built in aluminum before 20 December 2017 to comply with its requirements by 22 December 2025. However, if an EU country has more than 60 aluminium-alloy passenger ships flying its flag on20 December 2017 it may exempt aluminium passenger vessels of classes B, C and D from the directive for 12 years after that date, provided that their safety levels are not compromised;   requires all new or existing passenger ships to carry a  passenger ship safety certificate  .   from when does the directive apply  Directive 2009/45/EC has applied since 15 July 2009. Directive 2009/45/EC  revised  and replaced Directive  98/18/EC  (and its subsequent amendments).  Directive (EU) 2017/2108 entered into force on 20 December 2017 and has to apply in the EU countries by 21 December 2019.   background   Vessels used for domestic voyages in EU waters must meet basic safety standards to protect the lives of their passengers and crew. These standards have been considerably strengthened since the ferry  Estonia  sank in the Baltic Sea in 1994.  Directive 2009/45/EC is the most extensive EU legislative instrument in the area of passenger vessel safety. It is complemented by specific EU rules for  roll-on/roll-off (ro-ro) passenger ships and high-speed craft  , and the  registration of persons on board  ships.  For more information, see:    Safety of passenger ships  (  European Commission  ).   main documents   Directive  2009/45/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 on safety rules and standards for passenger ships (recast) (OJ L 163, 25.6.2009, pp. 1-140)  Successive amendments to Directive 2009/45/EC have been incorporated into the original text.

   European Refugee Fund (2008-13)     European Refugee Fund (2008-13)     This decision establishes a European Refugee Fund of €614 million for the period 2008-13 as part of the general programme “Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows”.     ACT     Decision       573/2007/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 May 2007 establishing the European Refugee Fund for the period 2008 to 2013 as part of the General programme “Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows” and repealing Council Decision       2004/904/EC      [       See amending act(s)      ].     SUMMARY     This decision sets out the objectives of the European Refugee Fund (ERF) and the rules for its management. It also sets out the available financial resources and the criteria for their allocation.      Target groups      The fund is targeted at persons having refugee status as defined by the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 or enjoying a form of temporary or subsidiary protection, or who are being resettled in a European Union (EU) country. Persons who have applied for refugee status or for one of these forms of protection are also included.      Eligible actions      The ERF finances national and transnational actions, as well as actions that are of interest to the EU as a whole. National actions are implemented by EU countries within the framework of multiannual programming consistent with the EU’s strategic guidelines for the intervention of the fund (shared management). The budget allocated for EU level actions is implemented by the Commission (direct management).     The ERF supports national actions relating to:      reception conditions and asylum procedures, especially infrastructure and the provision of material, medical and legal aid;       the integration in the host country of persons in the target groups, especially measures relating to education, participation in civil and cultural life, access to the labour market, language training and assistance with housing;       the enhancement of EU countries’ capacity to develop, monitor and evaluate their asylum policies, and the collection, compilation, analysis, use and dissemination of country-of-origin information and statistics on asylum, reception and integration procedures;       resettlement, particularly the development of resettlement programmes and the provision of pre-departure information and material support;       the transfer between EU countries of applicants in the target groups.      The ERF supports transnational and EU level actions relating to the:      creation of cooperation networks between bodies located in two or more EU countries;       setting up of awareness-raising campaigns;       dissemination of good practice;       launching of pilot projects on EU level cooperation;       development of networks linking non-governmental organisations (NGOs) present in at least 10 EU countries and whose objective is to facilitate such exchanges.      The ERF also provides for a financial reserve for implementing emergency measures to provide temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons within the meaning of Council Directive       2001/55/EC      . This reserve can also be used to support EU countries’ efforts to address situations of particular pressure that result from the sudden arrival of large numbers of persons who may be in need of international protection and that place significant and urgent demands on their reception facilities or asylum systems.      Principles governing the fund’s actions      In line with the priorities and objectives laid down by the EU, the ERF will provide grants to support actions of a non-profit nature already co-financed by public or private sources.     Support from the ERF may not exceed 50% of the total cost of national actions. Exceptionally, this may be increased to 75% for projects addressing specific priorities identified in the strategic guidelines. The EU contribution is increased to 75% in the EU countries covered by the       Cohesion Fund      .     The Commission will adopt strategic guidelines for the period 2008-13, defining EU level priorities for each of the objectives of the fund.     The Commission will approve EU countries’ multiannual programmes setting out, on the basis of the Commission’s strategic guidelines, a strategy for and a description of the actions designed to achieve their objectives and additional indications regarding project financing. It will also adopt annual financing decisions approving each annual programme implementing the multiannual programme.      Committee, review and repeal      The Commission is assisted by the Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows Committee.     This decision repeals Decision       2004/904/EC      establishing the ERF for the period 2005-10. It must be reviewed by the European Parliament and the Council by 30 June 2013.      Background      This decision furthers the actions implemented by the earlier decisions establishing the ERF. It repeals Decision 2004/904/EC so that the ERF financial planning period coincides with the current multiannual programming period. As part of the       general programme “Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows”      , established by the communication of 6 April 2005, it provides for resources totalling €614 million for this period.

summary of   Directive 2003/33/EC on advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products   what is the aim of this directive  It regulates tobacco  *  advertising  *  and promotion in the printed media, on radio, in information society services and through tobacco-related sponsorship.   key points     Press and printed publications:  advertising is banned except for publications intended exclusively for the tobacco trade, or those printed and published outside the EU and not intended for an EU audience.    Radio:  all forms of advertising are banned. Programmes may not be sponsored by companies whose main activity is the manufacture and sale of tobacco.    Sponsorship:  this is banned for all events and activities involving or taking place in more than one EU country. The ban extends to the free distribution of tobacco products.   The legality of the directive was confirmed by the  Court of Justice of the European Union  in December 2006.   In May 2008, the  European Commission  published a  report on the directive’s implementation  .   Additional rules for  audiovisual media services  complement the directive by banning advertising and product placement of tobacco products on television and through on-demand services (e.g. services that allow viewers to watch a programme when they choose because it is, for example, available on the broadcaster’s website).   In addition to this, a non-binding  Council recommendation  urges EU governments to take various measures to limit advertising in their countries, including:   banning promotional practices such as offering ashtrays, lighters and price discounts,   banning local tobacco advertising on billboards, at points of sale and in cinemas,   requiring manufacturers, importers and large-scale traders to provide information on their spending on advertising, marketing, sponsorship and promotion campaigns not banned by EU legislation.      Directive  2014/40/EU   extended the EU rules on tobacco advertising and promotion to electronic cigarettes.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 20 June 2003. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 3 July 2005.   * key terms     Tobacco products:  all products, even partly containing tobacco, intended to be smoked, sniffed, sucked or chewed.     Advertising:  any form of commercial communication that aims, directly or indirectly, to promote tobacco products.
   Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia – External relations, Common Foreign and Security Policy     Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia – External relations, Common Foreign and Security Policy     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM(2011) 666      final – SEC(2011) 1203 – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was granted the status of candidate country for accession to the European Union (EU) in 2005. The Accession Partnership, adopted by the Council in 2008, supports the country's preparations for its future accession and the aligning of its legislation with the Community       acquis      . In 2008, negotiations for accession had not yet started since some progress still needed to be made with regard to the objectives and conditions defined within the framework of the Partnership.     In its       2011 Report      , the European Commission states that alignment with the       acquis      on the common commercial policy has progressed. Advancements in the field of foreign and security policy are also adequate.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission’s words)      In this field the Community       acquis      mainly comprises directly binding legislation which does not require transposition into national law. EU legislation results from the Union’s multi-lateral and bi-lateral agreements on matters of       trade policy      as well as from a certain number of autonomous preferential trade measures. In the fields of       development      and       humanitarian aid      , Member States must comply with the relevant EU legislation and international commitments and equip themselves with the capacities required to participate in EU policies in these sectors. Candidate countries are invited to progressively align their policies with regard to third countries, and their positions within international organisations, with the policies and positions adopted by the Union and its Member States.     The Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and the       Common Security and Defence Policy      (CSDP) are based on legal acts, legally binding international agreements in particular, and on policy documents. The       acquis      comprises declarations, actions and policy agreements. Member States must be in a position to conduct political dialogue under the framework of the CFSP, to align with the EU’s declarations, to take part in EU action and to apply the appropriate sanctions and restrictive measures. Candidate countries are invited to progressively align with the EU’s declarations and to apply sanctions and restrictive measures if required.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      Progress was made in the area of       external relations      , notably in the alignment towards the common commercial policy.     There was also progress in the area of       foreign, security and defence policy      . The country took measures to ensure better coordination between the competent authorities in the implementation of international restrictive measures. It aligned with all EU declarations and Council decisions and showed continued commitment to participate in civil and military and crisis management operations.     RELATED ACTS      Commission Report [         COM(2010) 660        final – SEC(2010) 1327 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The situation presented by the 2010 Report is satisfactory. The country cooperates fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Court. Furthermore, the country plays an active part in bilateral and regional cooperation initiatives, including for maintaining good neighbourly relations.

summary of   Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 — common organisation of the markets in agricultural products   what is the aim of the regulation   It aims to provide a  safety net  to agricultural markets through the use of market support tools (for example public intervention and private storage), exceptional measures and aid to specific sectors (particularly fruit and vegetables, and wine).   It seeks to encourage  cooperation  through  producer organisations and inter-branch organisations  (organisations that represent activities involving the production of, trade in and/or processing of products in a number of sectors).   It also lays down  minimum quality requirements  (marketing standards) for a number of products, as well as rules on  trade in agricultural products  and specific rules on  competition  .   key points   The main features of the common organisation of the markets (CMO) are:   Market intervention   The regulation lays down rules regarding:   public intervention, where products are purchased and stored by  EU  governments or their agencies until their disposal; and   aid granted for the storage of products by private-sector organisations.   It revises the existing systems of public intervention and aid for private storage making them more responsive and efficient. This is, for example, by means of technical adjustments for beef and dairy products, and certain cheeses with a  protected designation of origin or a protected geographical indication  .   Exceptional measures    The  European Commission  can take  emergency measures  against market disturbance caused by significant price fluctuations or when there are threats of significant price fluctuations. It may also take action to deal with the market impact of measures taken to combat the spread of animal diseases or serious market disturbances caused by a loss of consumer confidence as a result of public, animal or plant health and disease risks.   In the case of major market disruptions, the  reserve for crises  provides additional support to finance these measures.    Supply control measures     Milk and sugar quotas:  the regulation brings these to an end in 2015 and in 2017 respectively, allowing EU producers to be more competitive both domestically and globally.    Regulation in the wine sector:  in 2016, the regulation introduced a new system for authorising new vine planting rights to apply until 2030. This provides for an increase in the planted area of up to 1% per year.    Other measures   The annual budget for schemes promoting fruit and milk consumption in schools has increased (from €90 to €150 million).   Producer and inter-branch organisations   The regulation promotes the creation of producer organisations to strengthen their power in the food chain. It has been amended and supplemented by:   Regulation (EU)  2017/2393  which allows recognised  producer organisations  in  all sectors  in which a CMO has been introduced to carry out activities such as production planning, optimising production costs, marketing members’ products and contract negotiation. It also extends the aims of  inter-branch organisations  to preventing and managing risks relating to animal health, plant protection and the  environment  .   Regulations (EU)  2017/891  and (EU)  2017/892  which simplify and clarify the rules with regard to producer organisations in the fruit and vegetable sector.    Trade with non-EU countries   The import and export of certain products may require a licence.   Import duties  in the  Common Customs Tariff  apply to agricultural products, although specific rules are laid down for certain products (e.g. hemp, hops, wine and sugar for refining). Moreover, the Commission may fix  import tariff quotas  , i.e. specific limits on the volume of goods which may be imported with a reduced customs duty.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 1 January 2014.   background   The regulation on the common organisation of markets in agricultural products is one of a package of CAP reform measures. The package also includes regulations on:    the financing, management and monitoring of the CAP  ;    direct payments to farmers  ;    supporting rural development  ; and    determining measures on fixing certain aids and refunds related to common organisation of the markets in agricultural products  .   For more information, see:    Overview of CAP reform 2014–2020  (  European Commission  ).
   European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) (2007-2013)     European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) (2007-2013)     In order to reduce the gap between the levels of development of Europe’s regions and the extent to which the less-favoured ones are lagging behind, this Regulation defines the types of action eligible for financing from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). It also establishes the tasks of the ERDF and the scope of its assistance with regard to the “Convergence”, “Regional competitiveness and employment” and “European territorial cooperation” objectives of the reformed cohesion policy for the period 2007-2013.     ACT     Regulation (EC) No       1080/2006      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 July 2006 on the European Regional Development Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No       1783/1999      [Official Journal L 210 of 31.7.2006] [       See amending act(s)      ].     SUMMARY     This Regulation establishes the tasks of the ERDF and the scope of its assistance with regard to the “Convergence”, “Regional competitiveness and employment” and “European territorial cooperation” objectives as defined in the       general provisions      on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund.      Objective      The objective of the ERDF is to help reinforce economic and social cohesion by redressing regional imbalances. This is achieved by supporting the development and structural adjustment of regional economies, including the conversion of declining industrial regions.      Scope      The ERDF focuses its assistance on a number of thematic priorities reflecting the nature of the “Convergence”, “Regional competitiveness and employment” and “European territorial cooperation” objectives. In particular, it contributes towards the financing of:      investment which contributes to creating sustainable jobs;       investment in infrastructure;       measures which support regional and local development, including support and services for businesses, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);       technical assistance.       Convergence      Under the “Convergence” objective, the ERDF focuses its assistance on supporting sustainable integrated economic development and the creation of sustainable jobs. Operational programmes in the Member States are aimed at modernising and diversifying regional economic structures, particularly in the following fields:      research and technological development (R&TD), innovation and entrepreneurship;       information society;       environment;       risk prevention;       tourism;       investment in culture       investment in transport;       energy;       investment in education;       investment in health and social infrastructures;       direct assistance for investment in SMEs.       Regional competitiveness and employment      This objective has three main funding priorities:      innovation and the knowledge economy, including the improvement of regional R&TD and innovation capacities, entrepreneurship and creation of new financial instruments for businesses;       environment and risk prevention, including restoring contaminated land, encouraging energy efficiency, promoting the use of clean technology in public transport and formulating plans to anticipate and manage natural and technology-related risks;       access to transport and telecommunications services of general economic interest, especially by improving secondary networks and encouraging access to information and communication technologies (ICT) for SMEs.       European territorial cooperation      ERDF assistance under this objective also targets three key areas:      development of cross-border economic, social and environmental activities through joint strategies for sustainable territorial development. This involves, for example, encouraging entrepreneurship, protection and management of natural and cultural resources, and the development of collaboration, capacities and the joint use of infrastructures;       establishing and developing transnational cooperation, including bilateral cooperation between maritime regions. The priorities are innovation, the environment, better accessibility and sustainable urban development;       reinforcing the effectiveness of regional policy by encouraging regional and local authorities to form networks and exchange experience.      At the request of the Member States, the Commission may propose rules on certain categories of expenditure to replace national rules.     It is the responsibility of the Member States to designate a single managing authority, a single certifying authority and a single audit authority.     As laid down in the general provisions, Member States can also delegate the task of managing authority and joint technical secretariat to the       European grouping of territorial cooperation      (EGTC), which is the legal cooperation instrument.     For a project to be selected under this objective, it must include beneficiaries in at least two countries which are acting jointly in at least two of these four fields: development, implementation, staffing and financing. In the case of transnational cooperation, a programme may be implemented in a single Member State, provided it has been presented by at least two countries. Networks for cooperation and exchange of experience must consist of at least three beneficiaries in at least three regions and at least two Member States, and these must be acting jointly in all four fields.     The operational programme must contain the following information:      an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the area covered by the cooperation;       justification for the priorities selected;       information on the priorities and the specific objectives of each;       a breakdown of the spheres of assistance by category;       a financing plan;       implementing rules;       an indicative list of major projects.      Financing conditions depend on the location. Part-financing may be provided up to:      20 % for cross-border cooperation in NUTS III areas adjacent to the EU’s border areas;       20 % for cross-border cooperation for operations including partners outside the area in question;       10 % for cross-border and transnational cooperation to cover expenditure on operations in non-EU countries, if these operations are for the benefit of regions within the EU.       Specific types of area      The ERDF takes particular account of the specific nature of areas. Measures to help urban areas are incorporated in operational programmes, drawing on the experience of the       URBAN      initiative. ERDF action aims to resolve the economic, environmental and social problems of towns and cities.     As regards rural areasandareas dependent on the fishing industry, ERDF action must concentrate on economic diversification, such as:      infrastructure to improve accessibility;       telecommunications networks and services in rural areas;       development of new economic activities;       improving of links between urban and rural areas;       development of tourism and regeneration of rural areas.      For areas with natural handicaps, the ERDF helps finance investment in the improvement of accessibility, economic activities linked to cultural heritage, the sustainable use of resources and tourism development.     Finally, the ERDF helps finance the additional costs linked to the geographical situation of the outermost regions by subsidising:      freight transport services and the start-up of transport services;       operations linked to storage constraints, the maintenance of production tools, and lack of human capital in the local market.       Final provisions      The Regulation does not affect any assistance measures approved before its entry into force. Applications submitted under Regulation No 1783/99 remain valid, even though that Regulation was repealed as of 1 January 2007. The new Regulation applies as of 1 January 2007 and is to be reviewed by 31 December 2013.

ENERGY – HOUSING       Regulation (EC) No         397/2009        of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 amending Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 on the European Regional Development Fund as regards the eligibility of energy efficiency and renewable energy investments in housing.      The European Economic Recovery Plan encourages measures promoting the energy efficiency of buildings. This Regulation offers a framework for public investments in this area. National investment plans should be developed at the most appropriate territorial level (national, regional or local). Cohesion policy funding should support the measures taken by the poorest households.     Thus, concerning housing expenditure related to energy efficiency and renewable energies, the contribution of the ERDF is extended to all Member States. Other expenditure related to housing is to be limited to States which acceded after 1 May 2004. Article 7 of Regulation 1080/2006, which governs the eligibility of this expenditure, is amended accordingly.     Last updated: 17.09.2010  
   Turkey – Regional policy     Turkey – Regional policy     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     REFERENCES     Commission Report [       COM(2011) 666      final – SEC(2011) 1201 – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The       2011 Report      highlights progress concerning regional policy, but also some failures concerning the financial management and financial control of pre-accession funds. The administrative capacities still need to be strengthened.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission’s words)      In the field of regional policy, the       acquis      essentially comprises framework regulations and implementing regulations which do not require transposition into national law. They define the rules applicable to the development, approval and implementation of the       Structural Funds      and the       Cohesion Fund      , which each reflect the territorial organisation of the country. These programmes are negotiated and agreed with the Commission, but their implementation is the responsibility of the Member States. When choosing and implementing projects, Member States must comply with Community legislation in general, for example in the areas of public procurement, competition and the environment. They must have a suitable institutional framework and administrative capacities to ensure that the programming, implementation, monitoring and assessment of projects are carried out in a rational and cost-effective manner with regards to management and financial control.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      Some progress was made in the field of       regional policy and co-ordination of structural instruments      . There are delays in establishing the bodies to take over the financial management and control responsibilities of pre-accession funds in this policy area. Although the institutional administrative capacity has been improved, there is a need for further strengthening of this capacity and improved coordination between all relevant institutions in order to accelerate implementation.

   Reorganisation and winding-up of insurance undertakings (until November 2012)     Reorganisation and winding-up of insurance undertakings (until November 2012)     This Directive aims to guarantee, in the case of an insurance company with branches in other Member States failing, the application of a single winding-up procedure for the insured persons, policy holders, beneficiaries and creditors.     ACT     European Parliament and Council Directive       2001/17/EC      on the reorganisation and winding-up of insurance undertakings.     SUMMARY      Background      The measure forms an integral part of the Financial Services Action Plan (       FSAP      ) and fills a major gap in the financial services legislation. Its adoption comes at a time when financial services and personal investment are booming. The Directive was first proposed in 1987 but has involved a considerable amount of work, in particular owing to the complexity of Member States' insolvency rules.      Status      As matters stand, if an insurance undertaking with branches in other Member States has to be wound up, the authorities of each Member State in which the undertaking is represented may open separate winding-up proceedings. This can lead to conflicts of jurisdiction, and policyholders are not always treated equally. Similarly, if an undertaking has to be reorganised, the approaches can differ from one Member State to another. The Directive is designed to guarantee consumer protection, irrespective of the place of residence.      Principle of home country control      If an undertaking with branches in other Member States fails, the winding-up will be subject to a single bankruptcy proceeding initiated in the Member State where the insurance undertaking has its registered office (known as the home State). The proceedings will thus be governed by a single bankruptcy law. This approach is consistent with the home country control principle that is the basis for the European insurance directives (       life      and       non-life insurance      ).     The home country's legislation will assess the definition of branch and the way in which the assets and liabilities held by independent persons who have a permanent authority to act as agent for an insurance undertaking should be treated.      Scope      The Directive applies to undertakings having their head office inside the EU, European branches of insurance undertakings having their head office in a third country and creditors residing in the EU.     It will also apply to winding-up proceedings, whether or not they are founded on insolvency or are voluntary or compulsory, and collective proceedings as defined in the laws of the home Member State.      Principles of unity and universality      Only the competent authorities of the home Member State are empowered to take decisions on winding-up proceedings (principle of unity). These proceedings will produce their effects and be recognised by all Member States. All the assets and liabilities of the insurance undertaking should as a general rule be taken into consideration in such proceedings (principle of universality).      Principle of coordination      The supervisory authorities of the home Member State and those of all the Member States must be informed as a matter of urgency of the opening of winding-up proceedings.      Publication      The decision to open winding-up proceedings must have appropriate publicity within the EU. In addition to publication of the decision, known creditors residing in the European Union must be individually informed of the decision and kept regularly informed of the progress of proceedings.      Protection of creditors and equal treatment      The Directive provides for the protection of insured persons, policyholders, beneficiaries and any injured party having a direct right of action against the undertaking on an insurance claim. Member States may choose between two methods of protection: either granting insurance claims absolute precedence, or granting insurance claims a special rank which may be preceded by only claims on salaries, social security and rights in rem. Nothing impedes a Member State from establishing a ranking between different categories of insurance claims. In any event, creditors must be treated in the same way without any discrimination on the grounds of nationality or residence.      Withdrawal of authorisation      The opening of winding-up proceedings entails withdrawal of the authorisation to conduct business granted to the insurance undertaking.      Exceptions      The Directive provides for exceptions to the principle of the home country as regards the effects of the winding-up on certain contracts and rights (e.g. those of staff), third parties' rights in rem, reservations of title, set-off, regulated markets, detrimental acts, third party purchasers and lawsuits pending.      Professional secrecy      All persons required to receive or divulge information connected with procedures of communication are bound by professional secrecy.      Third countries      The host Member State of a branch of an insurance undertaking whose head office is located in a third country is regarded as the home Member State. If the parent undertaking has branches in several Member States, each branch must be treated independently (coordination between competent authorities, supervisory authorities, administrators and liquidators).     This directive is repealed by the       Directive on the taking-up of the business of insurance and reinsurance      from 1° November 2012.

   Towards a competitive and sustainable forest-based industry     Towards a competitive and sustainable forest-based industry     The European Commission is presenting a plan of action to reinforce the competitiveness and sustainability of the forest-based industries to meet the economic and environmental challenges the European Union will be facing in the future, including climate change, innovation, increasing global competition and the supply of wood and energy.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 27 February 2008 on innovative and sustainable forest-based industries in the EU - A contribution to the EU's Growth and Jobs Strategy [       COM(2008) 113      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The European Union (EU) is home to a competitive forest-based sector, which has a turnover of around 365 billion euros per year and generates value added of around 120 billion euros. It employs more than three million people in 344 000 enterprises, many of them in rural areas. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play an important role in the wood and printing sectors.     Whilst moving towards a low-carbon economy, the industries in the forest-based sector have to remain competitive. The sector must continue to prosper whilst tackling the issues of climate change, innovation, access to non-European markets and higher energy costs.     The Commission is proposing several measures to make the forest-based sector in the EU even more competitive, based on the following aspects:      access to raw materials;       combating climate change;       innovation, research and technological development;       trade and cooperation with third countries;       communication and information.       Access to raw materials      Increasing demand for raw wood for renewable energy, biodiversity requirements and recreation all lead to greater competition, and the gap between supply and demand is leading to higher costs. It is important to promote the domestic supply of unprocessed wood in order to guarantee availability. Wood, as a raw material, is the single largest cost for many industries in the forest-based sector, representing more than 30% of the total cost of paper production and almost 70% for sawmills.     The Commission advocates a       sustainable management of forests      . It encourages the Member States, industries and forest owners to:      promote tree planting and reforestation;       use         biomass        in a balanced way, not reserving it exclusively for the production of renewable energies, so as to ensure that the forest-based sector has a reliable supply of raw wood, thus bringing about a better match between supply and demand;       encourage the development of the recycled paper and wood markets, also by promoting the participation of the industry, with the aim of increasing the use of recycled paper and wood;       continue their efforts to reduce         illegal felling and the sale of products derived from illegally felled wood        .       Combating climate change      Forests and forestry products absorb carbon dioxide, and this       carbon storage      is the sector's contribution to combating climate change. More intensive recycling of wood and paper, rather than disposing of them in landfill, prolongs their ability to retain carbon. The Commission will be examining the advantages and disadvantages of the idea of including in its policy the storage of carbon in forestry products.     Higher gas and electricity prices are threatening the competitiveness of the forest-based sector. Even though some branches of this sector (e.g. plants for the manufacture of chemical pulp) are net producers of energy, others (e.g. paper plants) consume large amounts of energy. The Commission is focusing on the plan of action for 2007-2009 "       An Energy Policy for Europe      " with a view to creating a really competitive internal market in gas and electricity.     The Commission is focusing on future activities in the area of climate change and, in the context of the       Community greenhouse gas emission trading scheme      , will continue to evaluate the specific situation of energy-intensive industries and the risk of seeing production moved abroad to countries where the emission limits are less strict ("carbon leakage").      Innovation      The Commission reiterates the importance of innovation, research and technological development to support the competitiveness and ensure the sustainable management of the forest-based sector. The       7th Research Framework Programme      provides a framework for the study of biofuel and wood-based organic chemical production methods. An approach based on the establishment of innovation centres will be adopted with a view to promoting competitiveness within the forest value chain.

   Unfair commercial practices     Unfair commercial practices     SUMMARY OF:      Directive 2005/29/EC concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices       Directive (EU) 2019/2161 amending Council Directive 93/13/EEC and Directives 98/6/EC, 2005/29/EC and 2011/83/EU as regards the better enforcement and modernisation of EU consumer protection rules      WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVES?       Directive 2005/29/EC        :          defines the unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices which are prohibited in the             EU            .           applies to any act or omission directly related to the promotion, sale or supply of a product             *            by a trader to consumers             *            . It thus protects the economic interests of consumers before, during and after a commercial transaction has taken place.           ensures the same level of protection to all consumers irrespective of the place of purchase or sale in the EU.          Directive (EU) 2019/2161        on better enforcement and modernisation of EU consumer protection rules amends Directive 2005/29/EC, addressing new developments of the market, in particular in the digital area.      KEY POINTS      Unfair commercial practices are those which:          are contrary to the requirements of professional diligence             *            and;           are likely to materially distort the economic behaviour of the average consumer.         Certain consumers enjoy a higher level of protection due to their particular vulnerability to the practice or the product, their age (children or the elderly), their naivety or their mental or physical infirmity.       Directive 2005/29/EC distinguishes 2 categories of commercial practice that are unfair if they cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision that the consumer would not have taken otherwise:         misleading commercial practices        (by action or omission) and         aggressive commercial practices        .       Furthermore, Annex I to Directive 2005/29/EC contains a list of practices that are prohibited in all circumstances (‘blacklist’).        Misleading commercial practices        Misleading actions      A practice is misleading if it contains false or untrue information or is likely to deceive the average consumer, even though the information may be correct, and cause them to take a transactional decision they would not otherwise have taken. Examples of such actions include false or deceptive information regarding:      the existence or nature of the product;       the main characteristics of the product (its availability, benefits, risks, composition, geographical origin, results to be expected from its use, etc.);       the extent of the trader’s commitments (in codes of conduct by which the trader has agreed to be bound);       the price or the existence of a specific price advantage;       the need for service or repair.       Amending Directive (EU) 2019/2161      introduces a specific rule addressing misleading marketing of goods as being identical when in reality their composition of characteristics are different (often referred to as       ‘dual quality’      goods).      Misleading omissions       A practice is also misleading if material information needed by the average consumer to take an informed transactional decision is omitted or provided in an unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous or untimely manner and is likely to cause them to take a purchase decision that they would not have otherwise taken.       Directive 2005/29/EC provides a general list of information that should be regarded as material, such as price and the main characteristics of the product.         Amending Directive (EU) 2019/2161        includes additional requirements for online sales, such as: obligations for         online marketplaces         *        to inform consumers about the main criteria determining the ranking         *        of the offers provided in response to a search query, and the obligation to inform whether and how the authenticity of         consumer reviews is checked        .        Aggressive commercial practices        Transactional decisions must be made freely by the consumer. A practice is aggressive and unfair if by harassment, coercion or undue influence         *        it significantly impairs the average consumer’s freedom of choice and causes them to take a transactional decision they would not otherwise have taken.       Several elements must be taken into consideration in order to determine whether a commercial practice is aggressive or not. These include:          the nature, location and duration of the practice;           the possible use of threatening or abusive language or behaviour;           the exploitation by the trader of any specific circumstance of such seriousness (e.g. a death or a serious illness) as to impair the consumer’s judgment in order to influence their decision with regard to the product;           any disproportionate non-contractual condition imposed on the consumer wishing to exercise their contractual rights (such as terminating or switching a contract).         Annex I to Directive 2005/29/EC contains a list of 35 commercial practices which are considered unfair in all circumstances.       Practices prohibited in all circumstances (‘blacklist’)        Directive 2005/29/EC        contains a list of commercial practices that are prohibited in all circumstances.         Amending Directive (EU) 2019/2161        has added to the list several additional practices prohibiting the publication of fake consumer reviews, hidden advertising in search results and resale of tickets that the trader has acquired using automated ‘bots’.       Redress and penalties        Amending Directive (EU) 2019/2161        seeks to ensure that consumers have the         right to individual remedies        (for example, compensation, a price reduction, etc.) when they are harmed by unfair commercial practices.       EU countries must introduce         effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties        to punish traders who break national rules on unfair commercial practices.        Amending Directive (EU) 2019/2161        provides for criteria to be applied when imposing fines and requires EU countries to provide for fines of up to at least 4% of the trader’s turnover or €2 million when information about the turnover is not available when national authorities of several countries are working together on         major cross-border infringements        affecting consumers in several EU countries.       Guidance document      In 2016, the       Commission      issued updated       guidance      on the implementation and application of Directive 2005/29/EC. It explains key concepts and rules and gives practical examples taken from the case-law of the       Court of Justice of the European Union      and from national courts and administrations to make enforcement easier for national authorities and to ensure greater legal certainty for traders.     FROM WHEN DO THE DIRECTIVES APPLY?       Directive 2005/29/EC        had to become law in the EU countries by 12 June 2007. EU countries had to apply the rules of the directive as of 12 December 2007.        Amending Directive (EU) 2019/2161        has to become law in the EU countries by 28 November 2021. EU countries must apply the rules of the directive as of 28 May 2022.

(         European Commission        ).      KEY TERMS      Product:      any good or service including immovable property, digital service and digital content, as well as rights and obligations.      Consumer:      an individual who, in commercial practices covered by Directive 2005/29/EC, is acting for purposes which are outside their trade, business, craft or profession.      Professional diligence:      the standard of special skill and care which a trader may reasonably be expected to exercise towards consumers corresponding to honest market practice and/or the general principle of good faith in the trader’s field of activity.      Online marketplace:      a service using software, including a website, part of a website or an application, operated by or on behalf of a trader which allows consumers to conclude distance contracts with other traders or consumers.

   Export and storage of mercury     Export and storage of mercury     The European Union (EU) shall ban all exports of metallic mercury and certain mercury compounds and mixtures from 15 March 2011. With the entry into force of this ban, Member States must guarantee the safe storage of this metal used in or produced by certain industrial activities.     ACT     Regulation (EC) No       1102/2008      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2008 on the banning of exports of metallic mercury and certain mercury compounds and mixtures and the safe storage of metallic mercury.     SUMMARY     The ban on exports of mercury from the European Union (EU) shall contribute to reducing the global mercury supply, and, indirectly, to limiting the emissions of this heavy metal, which is extremely toxic to the environment.      The ban      This Regulation bans the exports of metallic mercury and certain mercury compounds and mixtures originating from the EU. The ban is to apply from 15 March 2011 to exports of:      metallic mercury (Hg);       cinnabar ore;       mercury chloride (Hg2Cl2);       mercury oxide (HgO);       mixtures of metallic mercury with other substances with a mercury concentration of at least 95 % weight.       Mercury storage      From 15 March 2011, mercury produced by certain industrial activities will have to be stored in conditions that guarantee the safety of human health and the environment. The industrial activities concerned are:      the chlor-alkali industry;       the cleaning of natural gas       non-ferrous smelting and mining operations; and       the extraction of cinnabar ore in the European Union.      Metallic mercury from these sources is considered waste, metallic mercury and can be stored:      temporarily or permanently in an underground salt-mine adapted for the purpose or in deep underground, hard rock formations; or even       temporarily in above-ground facilities specifically dedicated for that purpose prior to its final disposal.      This option constitutes a derogation from the provisions of       Directive 1999/31/EC      , which prohibit the disposal of liquid waste in landfills (metallic mercury is liquid at normal temperature and pressure).      Safety assessment      The safety assessment for the storage of mercury is carried out in accordance with Decision       2003/33/EC      establishing criteria and procedures for the acceptance of waste at landfills. This assessment shall ensure that the particular risks arising from the nature and long-term properties of the metallic mercury and its containment are covered       .       Storage permit      The permit which is granted to mercury storage sites shall include requirements for regular visual inspections of the containers and the installation of appropriate vapour detection equipment to detect any leak.     Member States shall submit to the Commission a copy of any permit issued for a facility designated to store mercury, as well as information on the application and market effects of this Regulation in their territory by 1 July 2012.      Exchange of information      The Commission shall organise an exchange of information between the Member States and the industries concerned on the possibility of:      extending the export ban to other mercury compounds, to mixtures with a lower mercury content and to products containing mercury (thermometers, barometers and sphygmomanometers);       an import ban of metallic mercury, mercury compounds and products containing mercury;       extending the storage obligation to metallic mercury from other sources;       time limits concerning temporary storage of metallic mercury.       Background      The ban on exports and the safe storage of surplus mercury are essential elements of the Community strategy concerning mercury adopted in 2005. This strategy aims to combat pollution caused by mercury in the EU and the world. It includes 20 actions which aim to reduce mercury emissions, limit supply and demand and protect against exposure, particularly to methylmercury present in fish.      References           Act               Entry into force               Deadline for transposition in the Member States               Official Journal               Regulation (EC) No                 1102/2008                4.12.2008               -               OJ L 304 of 14.11.2008          RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission of 28 January 2005, "         Community Strategy concerning Mercury        " [         COM(2005) 20 final        - Not published in the Official Journal].      In view of the risks to human health and the environment associated with mercury the EU is drawing up a strategy based on six objectives and accompanied by specific actions chiefly aimed at reducing the quantity and circulation of mercury in the EU and the wider world and populations' exposure to the substance.       Directive 82/176/EEC        of 22 March 1982 on limit values and quality objectives for mercury discharges by the chlor-alkali electrolysis industry [Official Journal L 81 of 27 March 1982].      This Directive lays down limit values for mercury emission standards in the EU's aquatic environment. It also lays down methods for measuring the mercury content in discharges and a monitoring procedure.     Last updated: 22.10.2010  
   Key competences for a changing world     Key competences for a changing world     This report assesses European Union (EU) countries’ progress in implementing the ‘Education and training 2010’ work programme during the period 2007-09. While focusing on the implementation of the European framework for key competences, the report also reviews the development of national lifelong learning strategies, the reform of the vocational education and training (VET) systems and the modernising of higher education.     ACT     2010 joint progress report of the Council and the Commission on the implementation of the “Education & Training 2010” work programme – ‘       Key competences for a changing world      ’ [Official Journal C 117 of 6.5.2010].     SUMMARY     This fourth joint progress report on the implementation of the       ‘Education and training 2010’ work programme      notes that policy cooperation at the European level has provided valuable support to countries' educational reforms. Education and training performance in the European Union (EU) has improved. Nevertheless, most of the quantitative targets set for 2010 have not been attained. Further work is needed to address the remaining challenges.      Key competences      The European framework for       key competences for lifelong learning      has been used in many EU countries as a reference point for reforming national education and training systems. It has contributed to the move towards a more competence-based teaching and learning approach. Progress has been significant on       school curricula      and in giving transversal key competences a more prominent part therein. However, additional efforts are needed in the       organisation of learning      , such as in:      putting to use the transversal key competences (digital competence, learning to learn competences, social and civic competences, sense of initiative and entrepreneurship, and cultural awareness);       updating the skills and competences of teachers and providing professional development opportunities for school leaders;       further developing assessment and evaluation tools to take into account the most important skills and attitudes within the key competences, including the transversal key competences.      A concern for EU countries is pupils’       reading skills      performance, which continues to deteriorate. Concerted efforts need to be made to increase literacy levels, especially among boys and migrants. In general, EU countries have adopted personalised approaches to learning for pupils with special needs, as well as programmes for acquiring basic skills at an early stage. Nevertheless, progress is slow and further efforts are needed to combat       disadvantage      .     EU countries must further develop their       vocational education and training (VET)      systems to address the full range of key competences more systematically. Work should focus on curricula, teaching and learning methods, and training of VET teachers. The full range of key competences must also be applied to       adult learning      . While EU countries have taken measures to increase adult participation in education and training, additional efforts should be made to cover all qualifications levels and to improve the competences of adult education teachers.      Lifelong learning strategies      Most EU countries have adopted lifelong learning strategies, which provide for flexible learning pathways. They have also progressed in the development of national qualifications frameworks linked to the       European Qualifications Framework      (EQF) and covering all levels and types of education and training. Efforts have also been made in the development of lifelong guidance systems for adults. Nevertheless, challenges remain regarding the:      implementation of the lifelong learning strategies;       further development of the lifelong learning strategies, in collaboration with stakeholders and other relevant policy sectors;       coherence and comprehensiveness of the lifelong learning strategies, so that they cover the full life-cycle instead of only specific sectors or target groups;       coordination of lifelong guidance systems to take into account the needs of young people.       Vocational education and training (VET)      The       Copenhagen process      provides for enhanced European cooperation on VET, with a view to improving the attractiveness and quality of VET systems. EU countries address these issues through the application of national quality assurance systems linked to the       European Quality Assurance Reference Framework for VET      . They also emphasise the professionalisation of VET teachers as well as on making VET more adaptable to the needs of learners and businesses.     However, EU countries must still tackle challenges relating to VET. For example, the relevance of VET with regard to labour market needs must be improved through:      closer cooperation between VET and the business world;       more work-based training (in addition to school-based training);       tools for anticipating future skill needs.      Efforts should also be made to progress faster in finding ways for learners of VET to continue on to higher education.      Higher education      Following an increasing awareness of the importance of enabling non-traditional learners to enter higher education, most EU countries have taken measures to facilitate access for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. At the same time, the diversity of income sources for higher education institutions is increasing. But, there is still the need to increase:      public as well as private investment in higher education;       access to higher education for those already in the work force for the purpose of continuing professional/personal development;       university-business partnerships to strengthen the autonomy of universities, as well as to improve their governance and accountability.       The way forward      While European cooperation in education and training has contributed to reforming national systems, critical challenges still remain. In particular, the European framework for key competences must be applied in full and the openness and relevance of education and training need to be improved. To this end, the Council and the Commission are committed to work together on the basis of the new       strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training      (ET 2020) and in the context of the overarching "       Europe 2020      " strategy.

   Disaster and crisis response in Non-EU Member Countries     Disaster and crisis response in Non-EU Member Countries     The measures set out in this Communication share the common objective of promoting efficiency, coherence and coordination between the various external policy instruments of the European Union (EU) in situations of disaster and crisis, while preserving their distinct mandates.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - Reinforcing EU Disaster and Crisis Response in third countries [       COM(2005) 153      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY      Ensuring a coherent and rational response      In addition to the existing external relations instruments, many internal policy instruments can be mobilised to strengthen the Community's overall response to disasters. These encompass instruments from fields such as research, the information society, justice, freedom and security and fisheries.     Diversity of capabilities is one of the strengths of the EU and is essential to meet the dual challenge of ensuring a rational, rapid and flexible response in the face of emergencies and of mobilising and developing these resources in a coherent manner.      Strengthening the response capabilities of the EU      The European Union (EU) is able to respond immediately to disasters owing to:      the Community instruments set out in         Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/96        ;       the Member States' capabilities mobilised under the         EC Civil Protection Mechanism        .      EU military capabilities, and logistical capabilities in particular, complement delivery of aid under these two mechanisms. It is necessary, however, to ensure that military capabilities used for humanitarian missions retain their civilian and impartial nature. The Commission considers that it is essential to preserve the neutrality of the 'humanitarian space' and therefore attaches great importance to compliance with the UN Guidelines on the use of military and civil defence assets in humanitarian operations in both conflict and non-conflict situations.     The lead role of OCHA in disaster coordination is recognised by the EU. Humanitarian aid from the Community is channelled primarily through the specialised agencies of the United Nations, the Red Cross and European NGOs.     The partnerships concluded by       ECHO      with the above organisations and the setting-up of rapid funding procedures mean that the Community is a front-line donor in sudden disasters. In order to improve preparedness, the Commission is to fund the pre-positioning of vital immediate relief items.     To       evaluate      needs reliably and rapidly, it is important to be able to depend on a network of humanitarian aid experts. The Commission is to increase the number of experts from 69 to 150. They will receive training in the assessment methodologies of the other institutional actors (United Nations, Red Cross) and will be possible to deploy specialised multi-sectoral teams within 24 hours of a disaster.     In order to improve       coherence of the overall EU humanitarian response      , it is essential, in the Commission's view, to set up a standardised information flow. It therefore proposes:     - to develop a network of Member States' humanitarian emergency focal points;     - to improve the existing system for EU humanitarian reporting (the so-called '14 point' system), making it fully consistent with the financial tracking system of UNOCHA;     - to put its field-based humanitarian aid experts at the disposal of Member States to advise in the provision of bilateral humanitarian assistance.     The       Community Civil Protection Mechanism      may be used outside the EU, either on an autonomous basis or as a contribution to an intervention led by an international organisation; coordination of these activities will be ensured by the Commission and the EU Presidency.     The Commission proposes to adopt several immediate measures which will contribute to improving the Mechanism and maximising the impact of its assistance within the existing legal framework. In the longer term more ambitious structural reforms of the Mechanism can be envisaged, underpinned by       additional financial resources      and aimed at a more robust civil protection capability.     Good-quality assessment of needs at an early stage is essential at all intervention stages. In order to strengthen the efficiency of Community reconstruction aid, the Commission will establish assessment and planning teams bringing together desk officers and sectoral specialists from across the Commission and its 130 Delegations.     The teams should be ready for mobilisation at short notice for missions of up to one month and should be able to draw upon external experts. To establish these teams:      a roster of in-house expertise will be established;       a common training course will be developed;       measures will be taken to ensure that staff can be detached from their functions and mobilised rapidly.      The Commission considers that the       Civil-Military Planning Cell      of the European Union Military Staff within the Council Secretariat has a crucial role to play in developing the EU's crisis response. Given the breadth of experience it has in managing relief and post-conflict stabilisation measures, the Commission has appointed two representatives to the Civil-Military Cell in order to promote coherence between the planning assumptions of the EC and the CFSP measures.      The need for longer-term structural measures      The Commission has announced the creation of a light structure to improve real-time policy coordination within its departments when facing crisis situations outside the Union. This would both increase the flow of information to decision-makers and strengthen coordination with the General Secretariat of the Council.     The Commission will continue to work on setting up a common logistical and administrative support platform for external actions, which will ensure provision of timely mission       administration, logistics      and       procurement      . It will also put in place a number of interim measures to accelerate the procurement for CFSP missions.     The creation of a       stability instrument      seeks to streamline the Community's response by creating a single integrated financial instrument.      Preventive measures, early warning system and disaster preparedness      Rapid response capacities need to be accompanied by an enhanced strategy for disaster prevention, preparedness and early warning. To that end the Community is considering the establishment of an ACP-EC natural disaster facility (see Annex II).     Taking the results of the 2005 World Conference on Disaster Reductions (Hyogo Declaration and       Framework for Action 2005-2015      ) as a starting point, the Commission will focus on:      integrating disaster risk reduction into sustainable development policies and into programmes in countries that have been affected by disaster;       strengthening capacities to become resilient to natural disasters;       developing a people-centred early warning system;       identifying, assessing and monitoring disaster risks;       reducing the underlying risk factors.      The Commission will encourage regional and sub-regional organisations to play a part in the implementation of early warning and alert systems by adopting a       multi-hazard approach      . The EC will focus on humanitarian aid and development assistance directed at local preparedness and national action, emergency communication and mitigation plans, including capacity building at national and regional level for disaster reduction. Specific tools will be developed in cooperation with the Commission's       Joint Research Centre      and OCHA, such as the Global Disaster Alert System (GDAS).     To enhance the       effectiveness of early warning      , the information systems, databases, satellites and ground measurement networks available to the international community must be significantly improved. To that end, the Commission will develop its programmes in the following fora:      the UN's International Strategy for Disaster Reduction;       the Group on Earth Observations (         GEO        ), which will implement the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) (         PDF        ).       Protection and support to EU citizens      To provide assistance to European citizens affected by a major crisis, the Commission supports the work of the Consular Affairs Group on the strengthening of consular cooperation and of the Police Cooperation Working Group on the setting-up of a coordinated EU mechanism for identifying disaster victims.     This Communication includes two annexes. The first is a report on the measures taken by the Commission in response to the tsunami disaster. The second illustrates the range of Community instruments and programmes which contribute to early warning and disaster preparedness across the world.      Background      This Communication is the Commission's response to the Community Action Plan presented by the Luxembourg Presidency at the "General Affairs and External Relations Council" (GAERC) of 31 January 2005, following the flooding around the Indian Ocean on 26 December 2004. In the Communication, the President of the Commission submitted a plan on the long-term development of the EU's capability to anticipate and react to future disasters and crisis situations.

   European Union missions in Bosnia-Herzegovina     European Union missions in Bosnia-Herzegovina     The European Union is leading a police mission and military operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina under the framework of the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) and is thus contributing to the implementation of the peace process in this country and the stabilisation of the Balkans.     ACTS     Council Joint Action       2002/210/CFSP      of 11 March 2002 on the European Union Police Mission [       See modifying acts      ].     Council Joint Action       2004/570/CFSP      of 12 July 2004 on the European Union military operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina [       See modifying acts      ].     SUMMARY     The European Union is leading two missions in Bosnia-Herzegovina, a police mission called "EUPM" and a military operation called "EUFOR ALTHEA".      European Union Police Mission (EUPM)      The aim of the European Union police mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina is to establish sustainable policing arrangements in this country under Bosnian ownership and in accordance with best European and international practice in this area. The Mission will lead monitoring, mentoring and inspection actions in order to ensure that police officers act in a professional, independent and impartial manner in accordance with legislation and agreements made under the Stabilisation and Association Process with the European Union.     The Mission will also ensure that police services are based on a transparent structure that takes into consideration the multiple ethnic composition of Bosnian society and that all the police forces in the country cooperate with each other. Furthermore, the Mission will ensure that police carry out investigations of corruption and that they are capable of working on all types of criminal activity, including organised crime and terrorism.     The EUPM consists of 192 international members and 220 local members (October 2008). The main headquarters are located in Sarajevo and monitoring units are deployed in the same location as various Bosnia and Herzegovina police structures at medium and high levels. The 27 European Union Member States contribute to the Mission alongside Canada, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and Ukraine.      EUFOR ALTHEA      The aim of the European Union military operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is to provide deterrence, to contribute to a safe and secure environment and to ensure compliance with Annexes 1.A and 2 of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, relating to military matters and internal borders.     EUFOR ALTHEA comprises around 2200 military personnel from 24 Member States, Albania, Chile, Macedonia, Switzerland and Turkey. The operation includes a multinational battalion and an integrated police unit based in Sarajevo, monitoring and liaison teams spread out across the whole country and five regional coordination centres in Sarajevo Tuzla, Banja Luka, Mostar and Zenica.      Context      On 1 January 2003 the EUPM took over from the United Nations International Police Task Force (IPTF) in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the deployment of which was provided for in the General Agreement Framework for Peace (or the Dayton Peace Agreement) signed in 1995. This was the very first mission organised under the framework of the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP).     EUFOR ALTHEA succeeded the NATO stabilisation force (SFOR) on 2 December 2004. Initially comprising 7 000 personnel, the Mission was restructured at the beginning of 2007 and its numbers were reduced to around 2200 personnel.

summary of   Directive 2002/14/EC – general framework for informing and consulting employees in the EU   what is the aim of the directive  It establishes general principles on the minimum information  *  and consultation  *  rights for employees in companies based in the European Union (EU). National legislation and industrial relations’ practices determine how these are applied.   key points    EU countries may:   choose whether the legislation applies to companies with at least 50 or establishments with at least 20 employees   establish special rules for companies essentially involved in political, professional organisational, religious, charitable, educational, scientific or artistic aims   determine that employers do not need to inform or consult employee representatives where this would seriously harm the company’s operation.     Information and consultation covers data on a company’s   recent and probable development of activities and economic situation   employment structure and probable development, especially if there is a threat to jobs   decisions that could lead to substantial changes in the way work is organised or in contractual relations.     Consultation must take place:   when the timing, method and content are considered appropriate   at the relevant management and employee representation level, depending on the issue being discussed   on the basis of the information the employer supplies and of the opinion of the employees’ representatives   in a way that enables employee representatives to meet their employer and receive a response to any opinion they might formulate   with a view to reaching agreement on decisions that could lead to substantial changes in the way work is organised or in contractual relations.     Employee representatives and their advisors must not make public any information they have received in confidence.   The original legislation gave EU countries the possibility of excluding crews of vessels on the high seas. That exemption was removed by a  2015 amendment  .   from when does the directive apply  It entered into force on 23 March 2002. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 23 March 2005.   background    The  European Commission  consulted employer and employee representatives in early 2015 on whether to merge the following 3 directives into one legislative text: the general framework for information and consultation of workers,  collective redundancies  and transfers of undertakings.   The exercise is also considering whether the concepts of ‘information’ and ‘consultation’ could be better aligned.   For more information, see:    ‘Worker information and consultation’  on the European Commission's website.     * key terms     Information:  data given by the employer so employee representatives can be informed about an issue and examine it.     Consultation:  exchange of views and dialogue between employee representatives and the employer.
   A budget for Europe (2014-2020)     A budget for Europe (2014-2020)     The European Commission presents a proposed budget for the period 2014-2020, aimed at contributing to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The proposed measures should enable the financing of the Europe 2020 strategy objectives and the eventual implementation of a truly European budget.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 29 June 2011 - A Budget for Europe 2020 [       COM(2011) 500      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This Communication details the future European Union budget for the period 2014-2020 and forms part of the       Europe 2020 strategy      . The proposed budget shall:      fund common policies, such as the         Common Agricultural Policy        (CAP);       assist the weakest regions by applying the principle of solidarity;       complete the internal market;       promote synergies, cooperation and large-scale projects in the fields of research, innovation and justice;       respond to existing and emerging challenges that call for a pan-European approach, such as climate change, demographic change and humanitarian disasters.       A budget for research, innovation and technological development      The EU must be competitive in terms of innovation if it wishes to play a leading role on the world stage. However, it lags behind significantly in terms of innovation and research. In order to catch up, the Commission intends to increase the level of European investment in research and development and bring it to 3 % of GDP.     To this end, the Commission plans to allocate       EUR 80 billion      for the period 2014-2020 to the Common Strategic Framework for Research and Innovation, complemented by the structural funds.      A budget for solidarity for sustainable growth and employment      The EU’s cohesion policy is an expression of solidarity with the most deprived regions. Cohesion policy also plays a significant role in achieving the ambitions and objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy across the EU. The Commission therefore plans to create a new category of region, namely ‘transition regions’, which would include all regions with a GDP per capita between 75 % and 90 % of the EU-27 average.     Furthermore, unemployment and poverty require coordination of national and European actions. For this reason, the       European Social Fund      (ESF) has a significant role to play. Its activities could be complemented by the       PROGRESS programme      and the       EURES      network.     The Commission intends to allocate       EUR 376 billion      to the cohesion policy instruments and to distribute this amount between the different areas as follows:      EUR 162.6 billion for convergence regions;       EUR 38.9 billion for transition regions;       EUR 53.1 billion for competitiveness regions;       EUR 11.7 billion for territorial cooperation;       EUR 68.7 billion for the Cohesion Fund.       A budget for connecting Europe      In order to be fully operational, the single market requires modern infrastructure. For this reason, the Commission proposes the creation of a Connecting Europe Facility in order to promote access to the internal market for all.     The Commission will dedicate       EUR 40 billion      to the creation of the Connecting Europe Facility, along with EUR 10 billion for investment in transport within the Cohesion Fund. This amount will be divided between three different sectors:      EUR 9.1 billion for energy;       EUR 31.6 billion for transport;       EUR 9.1 billion for ICT.       A budget for the Common Agricultural Policy      The CAP must be competitive, ensure an adequate and secure food supply, and preserve the environment and the countryside while providing a fair standard of living for the agricultural community. To achieve these objectives, the Commission wishes to proceed with some changes in order to integrate the CAP into the Europe 2020 strategy. In the future, the budget allocated to agriculture will also support the sustainable management of natural resources and tackling climate change, and will contribute to balanced territorial development throughout Europe.     The Commission intends to keep the       two-pillar structure      of the CAP with a greener and more equitably distributed first pillar and a second pillar that is more focussed on       competitiveness      and innovation, climate change and the environment. It intends to introduce the following changes:      greening of direct payments;       convergence of payments;       capping the level of direct payments.      The Commission proposes to allocate:       EUR 281.8 billion        to the first pillar of the CAP;        EUR 89.9 billion        to rural development.      In addition, an amount of       EUR 15.2 billion      will be distributed between the following sectors:      EUR 4.5 billion for research and innovation;       EUR 2.2 billion for food safety;       EUR 2.5 billion for food support;       EUR 3.5 billion in a new reserve for possible crises in the agricultural sector;       up to EUR 2.5 billion for the         European Globalisation Fund        .       A budget for investing in human resources      The 2020 strategy highlights the need to increase tertiary education in Europe and to reduce early-school leaving, while valuing culture and media activities.     However, the current architecture of the programmes which aim to achieve these objectives is still too fragmented. For this reason, the Commission proposes to establish a       single programme on education, training and youth      .     To this end, the Commission wishes to allocate       EUR 15.2 billion      to education and training, along with       EUR 1.6 billion      for culture. This funding should be complemented by the structural funds.      A budget for responding to the challenges of immigration      Policies relating to security and immigration issues are at the heart of European concerns. Significant changes on how to conduct these policies were introduced under the Lisbon Treaty. For this reason, the Commission wishes to henceforth simplify the structure of the expenditure instruments by reducing the number of programmes to two Funds:      a Migration and Asylum Fund;       an Internal Security Fund.      Furthermore, the Commission intends to allocate       EUR 8.2 billion      to home affairs, and       EUR 455 billion      to civil protection and the European Emergency Response Capacity.      A budget for making the EU a global player      It is important that the EU plays a leading role on the world stage, and that it ensures stability, prosperity and democracy in the countries surrounding it. In particular, the Commission wishes to develop its external strategy by creating a pan-African instrument under the       Development and Cooperation Instrument      (DCI). The EU also wishes to be involved in the process of democratisation in the Arab world.     The Commission does not consider that another major alteration of the legislative architecture applicable to the management of its external relations is necessary. It proposes to allocate       EUR 70 billion      for the external assistance instrument for the period 2014-2020.     And outside the MFF:      European Development Fund (ACP countries): EUR 30 billion;       European Development Fund (overseas countries and territories): EUR 321 billion;       Global Climate and Biodiversity Fund;       Emergency Aid Reserve: EUR 2.5 billion.       Projects requiring funding outside the EU budget      The       European Development Fund      (EDF) is financed outside the EU budget because of its specific status. The same applies to the       ITER      and       European Earth Monitoring programme      (GMES) projects, for which the costs are too high to be included in the EU budget.      A simplified budget      The new budget framework of the EU must meet the need for simplicity. For this reason, the Commission has decided to reduce the number of separate programmes and instruments. Complex programmes which have not been successful will either be redesigned in a simplified and more effective form or discontinued.     Another way to simplify the management of programmes is to put them under a single framework with common rules, keeping any exceptions or specificities to the minimum. For example, the three main sources of funding for research and innovation will be brought together within a single Common Strategic Framework for Research and Innovation. For funds under shared management, a Common Strategic Framework will replace the current approach of establishing separate sets of strategic guidelines for the different instruments.      Executive agencies      are called upon to play a greater role in providing better quality service delivery.     Mindful of the pressures on Member States' budgets and having regard to cut backs in national public administrative expenditure, the Commission proposes a 5 % reduction in the staffing levels of each institution/service, agency or other body.     The Commission also proposes to change the five instruments outside the financial framework, specifically:      the         Emergency Aid Reserve        ;       the         Flexibility Instrument        ;       the         Solidarity Fund        ;       the         Globalisation Adjustment Fund        ;       a new instrument to react to crisis situations in agriculture.       Conclusion      The Commission proposes in accompanying legislative texts a Regulation adopting a new multiannual financial framework, an inter-institutional agreement on budgetary matters and sound financial management, and for a Decision on own resources (with relevant implementing legislation).     In the months to come before the end of 2011, the approach outlined in this Communication will be set out in detail in the legislative proposals for the expenditure programmes and instruments in the individual policy areas.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 - jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of matrimonial and parental judgments   summary   A single legal instrument to help international couples resolve disputes, involving more than one country, over their divorce and the custody of their children.   what does the regulation do  It sets out:        —     rules determining which court is responsible for dealing with matrimonial matters and parental responsibility in disputes involving more than one country            —     rules making it easier to recognise and enforce judgments issued in one EU country in another            —     a procedure to settle cases in which a parent abducts a child from one EU country and takes them to another.      It  does not  deal with  substantive family law matters  . These are the responsibility of individual EU countries.   key points   The Regulation applies to civil law cases involving more than one country that relate to:        —     divorce            —     legal separation            —     the annulment of a marriage            —     any aspect of parental responsibility (such as custody and access rights).      One of its main objectives is to uphold  children’s right to maintain contact with both parents, even if they are separated or live in different EU countries  .  The Regulation  does not apply  to cases concerning:        —     grounds for divorce or the law applicable in divorce cases            —     divorce-related issues such as maintenance            —     establishing and challenging paternity            —     judgments on adoption and the associated preparatory measures            —     annulling or revoking an adoption            —     a child’s first and last names            —     the independence of children from their parents or guardians            —     trusts and inheritance            —     measures taken in response to criminal acts committed by children.       Matrimonial matters   There is no general rule on jurisdiction in matrimonial matters. To determine the EU country where the courts have the right to rule on a case, the Regulation instead sets out 7 alternative grounds for jurisdiction based on the spouses’ nationality or on where they normally live.   Parental responsibility   It applies to:        —     rights of custody and rights of access            —     guardianship, curatorship and similar legal arrangements            —     the designation and functions of any person or body in charge of the child or the child's property, or which represents or assists the child            —     placing the child in a foster family or in institutional care            —     measures to protect the child, covering the administration, conservation or use of his or her property.      Such matters generally come under the jurisdiction of the courts in the  EUcountry where the child usually lives  . If it is impossible to establish where a child usually lives (as in the case of refugees), the EU country where the child is present automatically assumes jurisdiction.   Child abduction   The Regulation also lays down rules to settle cases in which children are unlawfully removed or kept.  The courts of the EU country where the child normally lived immediately before abduction continue to have jurisdiction until the child lives mainly in another EU country.   Recognition   Under the Regulation, any EU country must automatically recognise judgments given in another EU country on matrimonial and parental responsibility matters. Recognition can be refused if, for example:        —     recognition is clearly contrary to public policy            —     the defendant did not receive the document initiating proceedings in time to arrange legal defence (in cases where the judgment was given in the defendant's absence)            —     recognition is incompatible with another judgment given between the same parties.      For judgments concerning parental responsibility, recognition can also be refused if:        —     the child was not given an opportunity to be heard            —     on the request of a person claiming that the judgment infringes his or her parental responsibility, the judgment was issued without this person having been given an opportunity to be heard.       Enforcement   A judgment on the exercise of parental responsibility enforceable in the EU country where it was issued can be enforced in another EU country when it has been declared enforceable there at the request of any interested party. However,  no declaration is required  for judgments granting rights of access or concerning the return of a child that have been certified by the original judge in accordance with the Regulation.   Cooperation between central authorities in parental responsibility cases   Each EU country designates a central authority (or more than one) whose duties include:        —     helping parents seeking the return of a child abducted by another parent and taken to another EU country            —     promoting information-sharing on national law and procedures;            —     helping courts communicate with each other            —     helping parents or guardians seeking to recognise and enforce decisions            —     seeking to resolve disagreements between parents or guardians through alternative means such as mediation.      Central authorities meet regularly as members of the  European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters  .   Existing agreements   As a general rule, this regulation replaces existing conventions on the same matters involving 2 or more EU countries. In relations between EU countries, it takes precedence over certain multilateral conventions:        —     1961 Hague Convention (law applicable to protection of minors)            —     1967 Luxembourg Convention (recognition of decisions on marriage);            —     1970 Hague Convention (recognition of divorces)            —     1980 European Convention (custody of children)            —     1980 Hague Convention (civil aspects of international child abduction).      With regard to the  Hague Convention of 19 October 1996 on parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children  , the regulation is fully applicable if the child normally lives in an EU country.   Exemptions and special provisions   Denmark is not a party to the Regulation and is therefore not bound by it.  Special provisions are applicable to:        —     the relations of Finland and Sweden with Denmark, Iceland and Norway as regards the application of the Nordic Marriage Convention of 6 February 1931            —     relations between the Holy See and Portugal, Italy, Spain and Malta.

   Pricing and long-term management of water     Pricing and long-term management of water     The Commission is presenting questions and options in connection with defining water pricing policies enabling the sustainability of water resources to be boosted.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, European Parliament and Economic and Social Committee: Pricing and sustainable management of water resources [       COM(2000) 477      - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Water management is one of the European Commission's environmental priorities. The framework directive on water sets out the guidelines for water policy in Europe for the decades ahead. It more especially promotes the use of pricing and taxation as an incentive for consumers to use water resources in a more sustainable manner and to recover the cost of water services per sector of the economy. It is with this in view that the Commission has prepared its communication on the pricing and sustainable management of water resources. Its aim is to enable a fruitful political debate to take place on this matter and to inform those concerned.     The Commission stresses that this communication should not be taken as solely advocating pricing in order to solve water-resource problems. However, this must be taken into due consideration and be combined with other instruments as part of drawing up of management plans for water resources at individual catchment-area level.      Water and water policy in Europe      The sustainability of water resources is threatened in several of Europe's regions. By way of an illustration one may mention the salination of groundwater, the reduced flow in many water courses, and the diffuse pollution that can be attributed to agriculture.     This being the case, the use of economic instruments (taxes, duties, financial assistance, negotiable permits) has gained increasing importance and was fully legitimised in the United Nations'       Rio Declaration      on the Environment and Development in 1992. The central environmental role to be played by economic instruments is also recognised at Community level. The Treaty considers that, in particular, the "polluter pays" principle is an underlying principle of European environmental policies. Furthermore the       framework directive on water      advocates a boosting of the part played by pricing in order to improve the sustainability of water resources.     The "water price" is defined as being "the unit or overall amount paid by users for all of the services that they receive in terms of water, including the environment" (example: wastewater treatment).      Water pricing policies in theory and in practice      In order to achieve the environmental aims and to include the major economic principles, water pricing policies must reflect the following costs:      Financial costs: direct costs embracing the costs of supply and administration, operation and maintenance, and also capital costs.       Environmental costs: cost of the waste caused by water use on the ecosystem, for example: salination or degradation of productive soils).       Resource costs: cost of resource depletion leading to the disappearance of certain options for other users.      Each user must bear the cost of consuming water. If pricing is to promote better water-resource use prices must be directly linked to the amount of water consumed and/or pollution produced.     There are major differences between the water pricing systems in the Member States. In the south European countries for example agriculture, which is a major water consumer, pays for its water at preferential rates (because of various subsidies). Recently pricing played an increasing part in the water policy in many Member Sates. In the countries which joined the European Union in 2004 water pricing is also expected to expand, mainly owing to the major cost of alignment with the Community patrimony.     The water pricing policy enables the pressure on water resources to be restricted and infrastructures to be maintained. Moreover, a harmonised approach to water pricing is needed in order to avoid any distortions in competition arising from uneven application of economic principles on the internal market.      Promoting water pricing policies enabling the sustainability of water management to be improved.      It is necessary, in order to map out a pricing policy, to be aware of the following factors:      The demand for water which, in agriculture, for example, is still not well understood. Measuring methods (meters, use of satellite scanning …) must be developed.       The elasticity of the demand for water as compared with its price.       The financial cost of water supplies.       The environmental cost of the resource. However, it is difficult to assess those costs.      It is relevant to incorporate a variable factor (quality, pollution) into pricing structures in order that these may genuinely provide an incentive.     For reasons of cost and political acceptability, the introduction of a new pricing system will have to be gradual. Moreover social-order considerations must be taken into account in water pricing, but must not take precedence where sustainable water resource management is under threat. Social back-up policies will be preferred to these. Systematic       ex ante      and       ex post      assessment of the effects on demand of any such pricing policies is needed.     The matter of scale is also to be considered. Financial costs are better assessed and managed at water-service distribution level, but in environmental terms it is that of water catchment area that is the most appropriate. This may cause difficulties in the case of cross-border catchment areas (for example the Rhine river basin): the cost must then be shared among the interested parties and the administrations in the various countries.     In order to ease the transition to incentive pricing, it might be necessary to adapt the existing institutional framework. It would, in particular, be necessary to ensure transparency (via information and communication policies and quality/price comparisons) and the involvement of the public in water pricing polices. Monitoring water prices in order to ensure that these reflect costs in an adequate manner must also take place.     The water pricing policies must be combined with other measures in order to solve the qualitative and quantitative water resource management problems. It must also ensure better synergy between water pricing policy and the other European Union's policies: the common agricultural policy or the structural and cohesion policies must also provide incentives for better use of water. The European Commission's framework research and technological development programme also has a key role to play in providing new economic assessment and analysis methodologies.     Implementation of the framework directive on water will provide the necessary impetus for formulating water-price policies based on the factors set out in this communication.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 663/2009 — programme to aid economic recovery by granting EU financial assistance to projects in the field of energy   what is the aim of the regulation  It sets up the European energy programme for recovery (EEPR) to fund projects in key areas of the energy sector:   gas and electricity infrastructures  *  ;   offshore wind energy  *  ; and   carbon capture and storage  *  .   It was established to support the EU’s:   economic recovery from the 2008 economic and financial crisis; and    energy  policy objectives.   key points   The programme finances gas and electricity infrastructure projects which aim to:   secure and diversify sources of energy and supplies;   make the interoperability (i.e. the interconnection) of networks safe and reliable;   develop and optimise the capacity of the network; and   connect renewables to the energy grid or network.    Offshore wind projects  are given funding when they meet certain criteria which take into account the construction of the infrastructure, the innovative features of the project and the project’s contribution to the existing wind energy grid.   Carbon capture and storage  projects are given funding when the project demonstrates that it can capture at least 80 % of carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) in industrial installations.  The programme’s budget totals €3.98 billion, broken down as follows:   €2.3 billion going to  gas  (€1.4bn) and  electricity  (€910 million)  infrastructure projects  ;   €565 million to  offshore wind projects  ;   €15 million to two  small island projects  ;   €1.05 billion to 13  carbon capture and storage projects  ;   €146 million to the programme’s  financial instrument  , later set up under Regulation (EU) No  1233/2010  which amended Regulation (EC) No 663/2009 to support projects relating to energy efficiency.   The  European Energy Efficiency Fund  , established in 2011, took over the role of allocating money to projects that support energy efficiency. It supports projects concerning:   public and private buildings incorporating energy efficiency and/or renewable energy solutions, including those using information and communication technologies (ICTs);   investments in high energy-efficient combined heat and power, including micro-cogeneration, and district heating/cooling networks, in particular from renewable energy sources;   decentralised renewable energy sources embedded in local settings and their integration in electricity grids;   micro-generation from renewable energy sources;   clean urban transport supporting increased energy efficiency and integrating renewable energy sources (public transport, electric and hydrogen vehicles);   local infrastructure, including efficient public outdoor lighting such as street lighting, electricity storage solutions, smart metering, and smart grids, that make full use of ICTs;   energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies with innovation and economic potential using the best available procedures.    Reports   The  European Commission  publishes reports every year on the EEPR’s implementation. A  report  on the EEPR published in 2018 after 7 years of implementation shows that:   35 out of 44 gas and electricity infrastructure projects have been completed;   4 out of 9 offshore wind projects are operational; but   only 1 of the 6 carbon capture and storage projects has been completed and 3 have been terminated prematurely.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 1 August 2009.   background   The EEPR forms part of the  economic recovery plan  , established to remedy the effects of the financial and energy crisis that affected the European economy in 2008.  For more information, see:    Objective of the fund  (  European Energy Efficiency Fund  )    European Energy Programme for Recovery — projects  (  European Commission  )    Energy — funding  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Gas and electricity infrastructures:    all high-voltage lines, other than distribution networks, and underwater links, provided that this infrastructure is used for interregional or international transmission or connection;   high-pressure gas pipelines, excluding those of distribution networks;   underground storage facilities connected to the high-pressure gas pipelines;   reception, storage and regasification facilities for liquefied natural gas; and   any equipment or installations essential for the above forms of infrastructure to operate properly, including protection, monitoring and control systems.     Offshore wind projects:  wind farms out at sea.   Carbon capture and storage:  a way of reducing the effect of climate change, consisting of the capture of CO  2  from industrial installations, its transport to a storage site and its injection into underground geological formations.
   The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia – Information society and media     The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia – Information society and media     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM (2011) 666      final – SEC(2011) 1203 – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was granted candidate country status for European Union (EU) membership in 2005. The Accession Partnership, adopted by the Council in 2008, supports the country’s preparations in view of its future membership and the alignment of its legislation with the Community       acquis      . In 2008, the accession negotiations had not yet been opened, as some progress still needed to be made on the objectives and conditions set out in the partnership.     The       2011 Report      notes progress with regard to the alignment of the legislation with the       acquis      , although the capacities of the Broadcasting Council to monitor the market remain inadequate.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission’s words)      The       acquis      includes specific rules relating to       electronic communications      ,       information society services      , particularly e-commerce and services based on conditional access, and to audiovisual services. In the field of electronic communications, the       acquis      aims at removing the obstacles preventing the smooth running of the internal market of telecommunications services and networks, at encouraging competition and at protecting consumers’ interests, specifically by guaranteeing the universal availability of modern services.     In terms of       audiovisual policy      , the       acquis      requires legislative alignment with the       Television without Frontiers Directive      which creates the conditions for the free movement of television programmes in the European Union. The       acquis      intends to define a transparent, reliable and efficient regulatory framework for public and private broadcasting which meets European standards. It also estimates the capacity for participating in the Community programmes Media Plus and Media Training.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      Progress was made in the field of       information society and media      . Alignment with the EU       acquis      is advancing and most of the key competitive safeguards were introduced. The capacity of the Broadcasting Council to monitor the market effectively remains inadequate.     RELATED ACTS      Commission Report [         COM(2010) 660        final – SEC(2010) 1327 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2010 Report presents advancements concerning alignment with the       acquis      and liberalisation of the Information Society and Media sector. In particular, progress must be made to ensure the proper functioning of public service broadcasters.      Commission Report [         COM(2009) 533        final – SEC(2009) 1334 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The October 2009 report indicates that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has progressed on audiovisual policy, having partly met its objectives. However, while the administrative capacity of the Broadcasting Council was strengthened, no efforts were made to ensure the sustainability of the public service broadcaster. Also, both still face political interference. In the field of culture, the country has made some progress and its preparations now meet the EU requirements.      Commission Report [         COM(2008) 674        final – SEC(2008) 2699 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The November 2008 report noted that some progress had been achieved in the field of audiovisual policy and that preparations in the media sector were advanced. However, certain concerns remained, in particular with regard to the financial situation of the Broadcasting Council and the public service broadcaster. In the area of culture, progress had been good. The country has been participating in the Community programme on culture.

summary of   Directive 2004/48/EC — enforcement of intellectual property rights    Corrigendum   what is the aim of this directive  This directive provides a minimum set of measures, procedures and remedies allowing effective civil enforcement of  intellectual property rights (IPR)  across the EU, ensuring standardised level of protection throughout the internal market.  In 2017, the  European Commission  adopted a  package  of measures to further improve the application and enforcement of IPR and the fight against counterfeiting and piracy. In particular, it published a  Guidance Communication  clarifying the rules set out in this directive where there have been differing interpretations in EU countries. The measures follow an 10-point  action plan  for enforcing IPR in the EU set out by the Commission in 2014.   key points    Objectives   The directive’s main objective is to ensure that the same tools are available throughout the EU for creators and innovators to be able to exercise their intellectual property rights. However, in addition to tackling counterfeiting and piracy, it also helps to achieve other objectives which include:    promoting innovation and business competitiveness  — punishing counterfeiting and piracy effectively, can help ensure confidence in the  single market  ;    safeguarding employment in Europe  — damage suffered by businesses as a result of counterfeiting and piracy is reflected in the number of jobs offered;    ensuring consumer protection  — consumers are deliberately cheated as to the quality they are entitled to expect from a product posing risks to both health (e.g. counterfeit medicines or cosmetics) and safety (e.g. counterfeit toys or electrical appliances) and do not in principle benefit from a guarantee, after-sales service or effective remedy in the event of damage;    ensuring the maintenance of public order  — counterfeiting and piracy infringe labour legislation (clandestine labour), tax legislation (loss of government revenue), health legislation and legislation on product safety.    Scope   The directive applies to any infringement of IPRs provided for by EU law and/or by the national law of the EU country concerned.  This directive does not affect:   the EU rules on the enforcement of rights concerning and related to copyright;   EU rules governing the substantive law on intellectual property (that is, law defining rights and obligations in relation to intellectual property);   EU countries’ international obligations and notably the  Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  (known as the ‘  TRIPS Agreement  ’);   any national rules in EU countries relating to criminal procedures or penalties for infringing IPRs.    General obligation    EU countries should set up the measures, procedures and remedies needed to ensure the enforcement IPRs and take appropriate action against those responsible for counterfeiting and piracy.   Those measures, procedures and remedies should be  effective, proportionate and dissuasive  , but  avoid creating barriers  to legitimate trade and offer  safeguards against their abuse  .    Application for protection   A request to apply intellectual property protection measures may be submitted by:   the holders of IPRs,   all other persons authorised to use those rights (e.g. licensees) and bodies representing holders of intellectual property rights (intellectual property collective rights-management bodies and professional defence bodies) in accordance with the applicable law.    Right of information   At the request of the claimant, a court may order information to be provided on the origin of the goods or services that are thought to infringe an IPR and on the networks for their distribution or supply, by the infringer or any other person, if that person:   was found in possession of the infringing goods on a commercial scale;   was found to be using the infringing services on a commercial scale;   was found to be providing on a commercial scale services used in infringing activities;   was indicated as being involved in the production, manufacture or distribution of the infringing goods or services.    Rules on obtaining and preserving the evidence   At the request of the applicant, a court may order the opposing party to present evidence which lies in its control, subject to the protection of confidential information. The court may also issue measures allowing relevant evidence to be preserved in respect of the alleged infringement.   Provisional and precautionary measures   At the request of the applicant, a court may issue an interlocutory injunction  *  intended to:   prevent any impending infringement of an IPR;   forbid, on a provisional basis, the continuation of the alleged infringements of an IPR;   make the continuation of the alleged infringement subject to the lodging of guarantees intended to ensure that the right holder is  compensated  .   In certain cases, the judicial authorities may authorise the  precautionary seizure  of the movable and immovable property of the alleged infringer, including the blocking of his/her bank accounts and other assets.   Measures resulting from a decision on the case   At the request of the applicant, a court may order corrective measures allowing the recall or removal of the infringing goods from the market or their destruction.  A court may also issue a  permanent injunction  preventing the infringement from continuing or award  damages  to the injured party.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 20 May 2004 and had to become law in the EU countries by 29 April 2006.   background     Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Interlocutory injunction:  also known as interim injunctions, these are temporary court orders requiring or preventing a party from doing certain acts pending the final ruling on the case.
   Interoperability of the trans-European rail system     Interoperability of the trans-European rail system     The competitiveness of the railway system, particularly for freight, is today limited by differences between Member States in terms of stock, technology, signalling systems and safety regulations. The new Directive focuses on establishing common standards for signalling and control systems, telematic systems for freight services, the operation and management of rolling stock intended for international freight, and staff qualifications.     ACT     Directive       2004/50/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 amending Council Directive       96/48/EC      on the interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system and Directive       2001/16/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council on the interoperability of the trans-European conventional rail system [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY      DEFINITION OF INTEROPERABILITY       Interoperability      is defined as the capability to operate on any stretch of the rail network without any difference. In other words, the focus is on making the different technical systems on the EU's railways work together.     Today, the competitiveness of the railways is curbed by the differences between Member States in terms of rolling stock, technology, signalling systems, safety regulations, braking systems, traction currents and speed limits. This state of affairs forces international trains crossing several States to stop at "frontiers".     Historically, these technical differences met the need to protect the Member States' own interests or those of their rail industry. At the same time, the road transport industry took advantage of its freedom from technical barriers to reinforce its position on the market.      CURRENT LEGISLATION AND THE NEW PROPOSAL      Three directives are currently in force on interoperability:      Directive         96/48/EC        on the interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system;        Directive 2001/16/EC        on the interoperability of the trans-European conventional rail system;       Directive         2004/50/EC        amending the two previous directives.      The objective of these three directives is to narrow down the divide so that international trains can provide a better, completely safe service when they change national networks. The complete opening-up of the rail network to international freight services, scheduled for 2008, implies the need to put interoperability into action on the whole network.     The complete opening-up of the rail network to international freight services, scheduled for 2008, implies the need to put interoperability into action on the whole network.     The new Directive       2004/50/EC      modernises the existing legislation on high-speed rail and extends the directive on conventional rail to the whole of the European rail system. Nevertheless, it will not imply total, forced technical harmonisation of the railway system. In practice, the interoperability process has several facets:      application of a homogeneous legal framework for the procedures for verification of application of the essential requirements on safety, health, technical compatibility, reliability, availability and environmental impact;       application of an identical procedure for placing in service trains intended to operate on the same infrastructure;       search for the level of technical compatibility that is necessary and adequate to allow operation of heterogeneous rolling stock;       search for a level of technical harmonisation contributing to gradual establishment of an internal market in equipment and services for the construction, renewal, upgrading and operation of the rail system.       Directive         96/48/EC        : interoperability of the high      -       speed rail system      The first measure on interoperability was taken with the adoption of Directive 96/48/EC on the       interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system      .     In order to achieve the objectives set, technical specifications for interoperability (TSI) are drawn up by the European Association for Railway Interoperability (       AEIF      ), which acts as the joint representative body bringing together representatives of the infrastructure managers, railway companies and industry.     8. The technical specifications for interoperability (TSI) are technical solutions designed to ensure compliance with the essential requirements for interoperability and to make the railway system operational.      Directive         2001/16/EC        : interoperability of the conventional rail system      Directive       2001/16/EC      , like the directive on the high-speed system, introduces       Community procedures for preparation and adoption of TSI      .     This directive requires adoption of a first group of priority TSI within three years, i.e. in 2004, in the following areas:      control/command and signalling systems;       telematics applications for freight services;       traffic operation and management, including staff qualifications for cross-border services;       freight wagons;       noise problems deriving from rolling stock and infrastructure.       Directive         2004/50/EC       The aim of this Directive is to establish the conditions to be met to achieve the interoperability within Community territory of the trans-European high-speed rail system as described in Annex I. These conditions concern the design, construction, placing in service, upgrading, renewal, operation and maintenance of the parts of this system placed in service when the Directive enters into force, as well as the qualifications and health and safety conditions of the staff who contribute to its operation.     At the same time, the Directive provides that trains should be equipped with a recording device. The data collected by this device and the processing of the information must be harmonised.      CONCLUSIONS      The biggest limitation of modes of transport such as rail is that they cannot provide door-to-door goods services. Time is wasted and competitiveness lost because the systems and networks are not harmonised.     In this context, the       White Paper      on European transport policy considers interoperability a key component in       revitalising the railways      and, consequently, shifting the balance between modes. The ultimate objective is to reduce congestion on the EU's roads and to build a legally and technically integrated European railway area.     This package of legislation will make it possible to form major long-distance European freight corridors. One example is the agreement between the French and German railways (SNCF and Deutsche Bahn) to pool a fleet of locomotives despite the technical differences along this cross-border route.     Today's technical and regulatory barriers work in favour of the existing companies and are still slowing down the entry of new operators and completion of a more competitive market.     Establishment of an open market free of technical barriers will guarantee higher quality and greater demand and allow the railways to go ahead with new investments.

Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the European Commission and the European railway associations (ERC - UIC - UNIFE - EIM) establishing the basic principles for the definition of an EU deployment strategy for ERTMS [Not published in the Official Journal].      The European Commission and representatives of the European rail sector (manufacturers, infrastructure managers and companies) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the deployment of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) to create an interoperable European rail network. ERTMS is a radio system used to send information to trains from the ground. A computer on board uses the information to calculate the maximum permitted speed and automatically slows the train down if necessary. ERTMS deployment means there will be one system for European trains, instead of the twenty different ones used at present; it will reduce infrastructure and maintenance costs and make the European rail network safer.     To implement it, EUR 4 billion euros need to be invested over the next ten years for the main priority routes. At first, ERTMS will coexist with the national signalling systems in use now.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings    Regulation (EU) 2019/1381 on the transparency and sustainability of the EU risk assessment in the food chain   what is the aim of the regulations   Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 introduces a harmonised, effective, fast and transparent authorisation procedure for  food additives  ,  food enzymes  and  food flavourings  in the EU, aiming to facilitate the free movement of food while assuring consumer health. It does not apply to smoke flavourings.   The procedure is based on a risk assessment by the  European Food Safety Authority  (EFSA), set up under Regulation (EC) No  178/2002  , and leads to the updating of a  Community  (EU)  list  for each of the 3 categories of substance.   Amending Regulation (EU) 2019/1381 introduces new rules on transparency and confidentiality in risk assessment.   key points    Common procedure    Only substances authorised for the EU market are on the  Community list  (in Annex II), which is updated on the initiative of the  European Commission  , of an EU country or of another interested party through an official application.   The Commission forwards applications for substances to be included on the list to EFSA for risk assessment (mandatory where there could be an effect on human health). EFSA must normally respond within 9 months. In justified cases where EFSA requests additional information from applicants, the period may be extended. EFSA makes public, under the 2019 amendment, any additional information supplied by the applicant.   The Commission issues a draft regulation updating the EU list within 9 months of receiving EFSA’s opinion.   The process may be halted by the Commission at any time. In urgent cases, there are special arrangements for adding, removing or changing conditions for substances on the list.   The Commission is assisted by the  Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed  in updating the EU list.    Implementation   The Commission had 2 years from the adoption of the regulations on additives, enzymes and flavourings, after consultation with EFSA on risk assessment, to finalise how it would deal with applications, including:   content, drafting and presentation;   checking the validity of applications;   the type of information to be included.    Transparency    Under Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, EFSA ensures the transparency of its activities in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.   Amending Regulation (EU) 2019/1381 introduces new rules on transparency requiring EFSA, where the Commission requests its opinion, to make the application public without delay, including relevant supporting information and additional information supplied by the applicant, as well as its scientific opinions. EFSA makes public any request for its opinion as well as any extension of time limits for its work.    Confidentiality    Under Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, applicants may request certain parts of their applications to be treated as confidential, along with verifiable justification.   Amending Regulation (EU) 2019/1381 allows EFSA to also grant confidentiality for the following, where applicable, if the applicant demonstrates that disclosure could significantly harm its interests (except for information relevant to the assessment of safety):   information provided on material used to manufacture the substance concerned;   information on the materials or products in which the applicant intends to use the substance;   detailed analytical information on the variability and stability of individual production batches.      Emergencies   If there is an emergency connected with a substance on the list, the Commission initiates EFSA food safety procedures.   Companion legislation   The 2008 regulation was adopted at the same time as the following companion legislation, which goes into more detail on the 3 categories:   Regulation (EC) No  1332/2008  on food enzymes (see  summary  );   Regulation (EC) No  1333/2008  on food additives (see  summary  );   Regulation (EC) No  1334/2008  on flavourings (see  summary  ).   from when do the regulations apply  Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 has applied since 20 January 2009.  Amending Regulation (EU) 2019/1381 applies from 27 March 2021.   background   For more information, see:    European Food Safety Authority     Common authorisation procedure  (  European Commission  ).   main documents   Regulation (EC) No  1331/2008  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings (OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, pp. 1-6)  Successive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1331/2008 have been incorporated in the basic text.

act   Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Central Bank, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - The 2015 EU justice scoreboard (  COM(2015) 116 final of 9.3.2015  )   summary    what does the justice scoreboard do  The justice scoreboard helps to identify possible shortcomings and to encourage EU countries to carry out any necessary, structural reforms in the justice sector. Effective justice systems help foster economic growth, hence their relevance for the  European semester  , the EU’s annual economic policy coordination process.   key points   The key findings of the 2015 scoreboard:   while there is  some improvement in the efficiency of justice systems  in EU countries, the situation varies from one EU country to another;   despite efforts to enhance the use of information and communication technology (ICT) tools for judicial systems,  some EU countries still experience discrepancies in the availability and use of ICT tools,  e.g. for electronic communications between courts and parties;    in the majority of EU countries, over 20 % of judges took part in continuous training on EU law.  This exceeds the annual target of legal practitioners who need to be trained in order to reach, by 2020, the objective of 50 %;   most EU countries enable  free online access to civil and commercial judgments  for the general public;   most EU countries are still to reach a  gender balance of 40-60 % of female/male judges  .

summary of   Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of life vehicles   what is the aim of the directive  It sets out measures to prevent and limit waste from end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) and their components by ensuring their reuse, recycling and recovery. It also aims to improve the environmental performance of all economic operators involved in the life-cycle of the vehicles.   key points     Vehicle and equipment manufacturers  must factor in the dismantling, reuse and recovery of the vehicles when designing and producing their products. They have to ensure that new vehicles are:   reusable and/or recyclable to a minimum of 85% by weight per vehicle   reusable and/or recoverable to a minimum of 95% by weight per vehicle.     They cannot use  hazardous substances  such as lead, mercury, cadmium and hexavalent chromium.    Manufacturers, importers and distributors  must provide systems to collect ELVs and, where technically feasible, used parts from repaired passenger cars.    Owners  of ELVs delivered for waste treatment must receive a  certificate of destruction  . This is necessary to deregister the vehicle.    Manufacturers  must meet all, or a significant part, of the costs involved in the delivery of an ELV to a waste treatment facility. For a vehicle owner, they should incur no expenses when delivering an ELV to an authorised waste treatment facility, except in the rare cases where the engine is missing or the ELV is full of waste.    Waste treatment facilities  must apply for a permit or register with the competent authorities of the EU country where they are located.   ELVs are first stripped before further treatment takes place. Hazardous substances and components are removed and separated. Attention is given to the  potential reuse, recovery or recycling  of the waste.    Clear quantified targets  for annual reporting to the  European Commission  exist for the reuse, recycling and recovery of ELVs and their respective parts. These have become increasingly more demanding.   This legislation applies to  passenger vehicles and small trucks  but not to big trucks, vintage vehicles, special-use vehicles and motorcycles.    Amending Directive (EU) 2018/849   Directive (EU)  2018/849  amends Directive 2000/53/EC giving the Commission the power to adopt:    implementing acts  concerning the detailed rules necessary to control EU countries’ compliance with the ELV targets and the exports and imports of ELVs;    delegated acts  to supplement the directive by:   exempting certain materials and components containing lead, mercury, cadmium or hexavalent chromium (other than in cases listed in Annex II), if their use is unavoidable and establishing maximum concentration levels allowed as well as deleting materials and components of vehicles from Annex II, if their use is avoidable,   introducing coding standards to facilitate the components suitable for reuse and recovery,   establishing the minimum requirements for the certificates of destruction,   establishing minimum requirements for the treatment of ELVs (Annex I).     from when does the directive apply  The directive had to become law in the EU countries by 21 April 2002. It has applied since:   1 July 2002 for vehicles put on the market as from this date   1 January 2007 for vehicles put on the market before 1 July 2002.   background    Every year, ELVs generate between 8 and 9 million tonnes of waste in the EU.

act   Directive  2011/98/EU  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on a single application procedure for a single permit for third-country nationals to reside and work in the territory of a Member State and on a common set of rights for third-country workers legally residing in a Member State.   summary    what does this directive do  The directive creates:   a combined single permit for residence and work for non-EU workers  legally  residing in an EU country,   a single application procedure for this permit,   a set of rights (including equal treatment compared to nationals in that country) for non-EU workers covered by the directive.   key points    Who is concerned?   The directive applies to non-EU countries’ nationals who are authorised to live or work in the EU, independently of their initial reason for admission. This includes:   non-EU nationals seeking to be admitted to an EU country in order to stay and work,   non-EU nationals who are already resident and have access to the labour market or are already working in an EU country.   Certain categories of non-EU nationals are not covered by the directive, such as those who have been granted EU  long-term resident status  (they are covered by other EU legislation).   Single application procedure   Authorities in EU countries must treat any application for this single permit for residence and work (new, amended or renewed) as a single application procedure. They must decide whether the application is to be made by the non-EU country national or by their employer (or by both).  The format of the single permit is the same as that described in Regulation (EC) No  1030/2002  establishing a  single residence permit for non-EU country nationals  .   Right to equal treatment   The single permit allows non-EU country beneficiaries to enjoy a set of rights, including:   the right to work, reside and move freely in the issuing EU country,   the same conditions as nationals of the issuing country as regards working conditions (such as pay and dismissal, health and safety, working time and leave), education and training, recognition of qualifications, certain aspects of social security, tax benefits, access to goods and services including housing and employment advice services.   The directive sets specific criteria, based on which EU countries can restrict equal treatment on certain issues (access to education/training, social security benefits such as family benefit or housing).   when does the directive apply  From 25.12.2013.

   Trans-European Transport Network Executive Agency     Trans-European Transport Network Executive Agency     The European Commission is establishing the Trans-European Transport Network Executive Agency (TEN-T EA) to manage and optimise the implementation of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T).     ACT     Commission Decision       2007/60/EC      of 26 October 2006 establishing the Trans-European Transport Network Executive Agency pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No       58/2003      . [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     An executive agency for the management of Community action in the field of the trans-European transport network (       TEN-T      ) has been established. Its status is governed by Regulation (EC) No 58/2003. It is managed by a steering committee and a director, who are both appointed by the Commission.     The creation of an executive agency permits the mobilisation of a high level of expertise by recruiting specialist staff. It should permit increased flexibility in the implementation of Community action in the field of the TEN-T and ensure better coordination of funding with other Community instruments.     Under the framework for Community action on the trans-European transport network, the Agency is responsible for undertaking tasks related to the granting of Community financial aid pursuant to Regulations (EC) No       2236/95      and (EC) No       680/2007      , with the exception of tasks which require discretionary powers in translating political choices (programming, establishing priorities, assessing the programme, etc.).     In particular, the Agency's tasks are to:      support the Commission in the selection and programming phases, manage the monitoring of Community financial assistance granted to projects of common interest under the TEN-T budget and continue with supervision required for this purpose;       ensure better coordination of the granting of financial aid to promote projects with a common interest which also benefit from the Structural Funds, the         Cohesion Fund        and the European Investment Bank (         EIB        );       provide technical assistance to project promoters regarding the financial engineering for projects and finalise common evaluation methods;       adopt budget implementation instruments (income and expenditure) and execute the necessary operations for managing Community actions within the field of the TEN-T as provided for in Regulations (EC) No 2236/95 and (EC) No 680/2007;       collect, analyse and send to the Commission all the information it requires for the implementation of the TEN-T;       take supplementary measures to contribute to the effectiveness of the TEN-T programme, in particular promote the programme to all stakeholders and increase its visibility to citizens;       provide any administrative and technical support requested by the Commission.      The Commission may also instruct the agency to carry out tasks of the same kind within the framework of other Community programmes or actions, if these programmes and actions are within the field of the TEN-T.      Subsidy and control      The agency receives a subsidy entered in the European Communities’ general budget. This subsidy is taken from the overall financial allocation for Community action in the field of the TEN-T.     The agency is subject to supervision by the Commission. It must report on the implementation of the Community action in the field entrusted to it, in accordance with the arrangements and frequency specified in the decision delegating responsibility.     The agency runs its operating budget in accordance with provisions stipulated in Commission Regulation (EC) No       1653/2004      .

summary of   Directive 2014/42/EU on the freezing and confiscation of instrumentalities and proceeds of crime in the EU   summary    what does the directive do  It aims to make it easier for national authorities to confiscate and recover the proceeds* and instrumentalities* from crime in the EU.   key points   It sets out  minimum rules  for freezing and subsequently confiscating the proceeds and instrumentalities of crime.  The criminal offences concerned are those in various EU laws listed in Article 3 of the Directive.  In addition to the confiscation (following a criminal conviction) of proceeds and instrumentalities, or to the confiscation of their value, Article 4 allows the confiscation of the proceeds of crime and instrumentalities in  cases of the flight or illness of the person concerned  (when it is impossible for the suspect or accused person to attend the criminal proceedings for a longer period of time, meaning that the proceedings cannot continue under normal conditions and a criminal conviction is not possible).  Article 5 sets out clearer rules on  extended powers of confiscation  , thus making confiscation easier when a judge is satisfied that the property in question has been obtained through other criminal activities by the convicted person.  Article 6 of the Directive enables confiscation where property has been transferred from the suspect to a third party, or directly acquired by a third party, who should have realised that it is a result of crime.  Under Article 10, EU countries must adequately manage frozen assets (for example by setting up Asset Management Offices), so that they do not lose economic value before they are eventually confiscated.  Ireland is taking part in the directive while the United Kingdom (   1   ) and Denmark are not.   from when does the directive apply  The directive entered into force on 19 May 2014. EU countries have to incorporate it into national law by 4 October 2016.   key terms    * Proceeds  : revenues from criminal activities.   * Instrumentalities  : the tools used to commit crimes (e.g. a boat used to transport drugs).   act   Directive  2014/42/EU  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 April 2014 on the freezing and confiscation of instrumentalities and proceeds of crime in the European Union (OJ L 127, 29.4.2014, pp. 39-50)  Successive amendments to Directive 2014/42/EU have been incorporated in the original text.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 471/2009 — statistics relating to external trade with countries outside the European Union   what is the aim of the regulation  It sets out harmonised rules on the production of statistics relating to trade in goods between the EU and non-EU countries.  It repeals Regulation (EC) No  1172/95  .   key points    Scope   Trade statistics concern imports and exports of goods  *  . In line with the  EU Customs Code  , this regulation establishes that:   goods leaving the statistical territory of the EU  *  are considered as exports;   goods entering the statistical territory of the EU are considered as imports.   Certain types of goods or movements of goods (such as  certain industrial equipment  , aircraft, military goods,  waste products  or electricity and gas) are subject to specific rules.   Data source   The customs declaration  *  for imported or exported goods is considered as the main source for recording statistical data.  However, EU countries are free to use other data sources to produce their national statistics.   Statistical data   For each monthly reference period, EU countries produce statistics relating to external trade in goods. These statistics are expressed in value and quantity, in particular according to:   the type of goods;   the importing or exporting country;   the statistical procedure;   the nature of the transaction;    preferential treatment on import  ;   the mode of transport.   Each year, EU countries compile statistics on external trade in goods and  business characteristics  , in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 177/2008, in relation to:   the  economic activity carried out by the enterprise  , according to the section of the EU’s common statistical classification of economic activities (NACE  *  );   the  number of employees  .   Statistics are prepared using data relating to  business characteristics  and  import and export data  .  Every 2 years, EU countries draw up statistics on trade in imported or exported goods  broken down by invoicing currency  . These statistics are compiled using a representative sample of records on imports and exports from customs declarations. If the invoicing currency for exports is not available on the customs declaration, a survey must be carried out to collect the required data.  EU countries may compile additional statistics for national purposes where the data are available on the customs declaration.   Data exchange   Data from records on imports and exports declared to customs authorities must be sent to the national statistical authorities within 1 month. These records must include a minimum amount of statistical data.   Transmission of external trade statistics to the  European Commission  (Eurostat)   Monthly statistics on external trade must be sent to the  Eurostat  within 40 days following the end of each reference month. If the statistics are revised, updates must be sent to Eurostat.   Quality assessment   Statistics sent to Eurostat must be precise, up-to-date, relevant, clear and accessible for users.  EU countries must provide Eurostat with a report on the quality of the statistics transmitted for Eurostat to assess their quality.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 1 January 2010.   background   This regulation is part of an initiative to make the EU’s statistical system more transparent.  For more information, see:    International trade — goods  (  Eurostat  ).   key terms    Goods:  all movable property, including electricity.

summary of   Regulation (EU) No 1291/2013 — the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-20)   what is the aim of the regulation  Horizon 2020 aims to:   strengthen the European scientific and technological base;   better exploit the economic and industrial potential of policies on innovation, research and technology.   Horizon 2020 is complemented by the European Atomic Energy Community’s  research and training programme 2014-18  and has a budget of €74.3 billion over 7 years.  The programme aims to contribute to attaining the target of 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) for research and development (R&D) in line with the EU’s  Europe 2020 strategy  .   key points   This general objective is pursued through three priorities:   Priority I: Excellent science  (€24.441 billion):   the  European Research Council  funds the most promising research at the frontier of science, such as the  NEW-FUN project  : a new era of printed paper electronics based on advanced functional cellulose;    Future and emerging technologies  (FET) supports scientific collaboration across disciplines on radically new, high-risk ideas;    Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions  provide cross-border training and mobility for scientists;    research infrastructures  support excellent European research facilities, equipment and data sources to attract world-class researchers.    Priority II: Industrial leadership  (€17.015 billion):    leadership in enabling and industrial technologies  supports research on information and communications technology (ICT), nanotechnology, advanced materials, biotechnology, advanced manufacturing and processing and space;   access to risk finance aims to fill the gaps in the availability of debt (e.g. loans) and equity finance (by selling shares to investors) for R&D;   innovation in SMEs gives help to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises to stimulate all forms of innovation.    Priority III: Societal challenges  (€29.679 billion). Funding focuses on these  specific objectives  :   health, demographic change and well-being;   food security, sustainable agriculture, forestry, marine, maritime and inland water research and bioeconomy (i.e. the sustainable production of renewable resources from land, fisheries and aquaculture environments and their conversion into food, feed, fibre bio-based products and bio-energy, as well as the related public goods);   secure, clean and efficient energy;   smart, green and integrated transport;   climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials;   Europe in a changing world - inclusive, innovative and reflective societies (e.g. research to address social exclusion and discrimination);   secure societies - protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens.   In addition,  spreading excellence and widening participation  is allocated up to €816.5 million to ensure that the  benefits of an innovation-led economy  are maximised (e.g. creating centres of excellence by associating research institutions to other institutions, agencies or regions).  Science with and for society  is allocated a maximum of €462.2 million to  recruit new talent for science  and to pair scientific excellence with social awareness and responsibility (involving not just scientists but citizens, policymakers and citizens’ organisations).   Non-nuclear direct actions  of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) are allocated €1.9026 billion. The  JRC  provides robust, evidence-based support for EU policies driven by customer needs (e.g. energy efficiency, transport safety and crop yield forecasting).  The  European Institute of Innovation and Technology  (EIT) with a maximum contribution of €2.711 billion plays a major role through the  Knowledge and Innovation Communities  (KICs) by bringing together  excellent research, innovation and higher education  .   Implementation   Horizon 2020 is implemented through the  consolidated specific programme  established by Council Decision 2013/743/EU. It is managed by the Commission in line with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012, the  EU’s Financial Regulation  .   Forms of EU support   Horizon 2020 supports research and innovation activities through grants, prizes, procurement and financial instruments. It may support  public-public partnerships  with international, national and regional research and innovation programmes. Horizon 2020 funds may also be combined with private sector funds in  public-private partnerships  (e.g.  Joint Technology Initiatives  ) in certain key areas.  Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013 lays down detailed  rules for participation in research and innovation activities  undertaken under Horizon 2020.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 23 December 2013.   background   For more information, see:    Horizon 2020  (  European Commission  )
   Road haulage and passenger transport companies: operating rules     Road haulage and passenger transport companies: operating rules     SUMMARY OF:      Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 setting common rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator       Regulation (EU) 2020/1055 amending Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 to adapt it to developments in the road transport sector      WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?      Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009:       sets out rules for companies wanting to enter and be active in the road haulage (i.e. transport of goods by road) and passenger transport business;       applies to all companies established in the EU that are active in (or intending to be active in) transporting goods or people in exchange for payment.       Amending Regulation (EU) 2020/1055      updates the rules for pursuing the occupation of road transport operator in order to combat the phenomenon of letterbox companies       *      and unfair competition.     KEY POINTS     Companies active in the road transport operator business must:      be effectively and stably established in an EU country;       be of good repute;       have appropriate financial standing; and       have the required professional competence.       Transport manager      Every road transport company must designate a       transport manager      who is responsible for continuously managing its transport activities. This manager must reside in the EU and have a genuine link to the undertaking, for example as an employee, administrator or shareholder.      How to become a road transport operator       A company wanting to be active in the road transport operator business must be         established        in an EU country with premises in that EU country where it can keep all of the         documents        (accounts, personnel management documents and data relating to driving time and rest, etc.) required for its business.       The company should have at least one         vehicle registered        in that EU country at its disposal (once an authorisation has been granted) and have an operating centre situated in that country with the appropriate technical equipment and facilities for the operation of the vehicle(s).       In addition:          neither the company nor the manager can have been convicted for any infringement of certain national and EU rules relating to road transport;           the company must be able to meet its financial obligations;           the manager must have passed a compulsory written examination, which may be supplemented by an oral examination.         Authorisation and monitoring       EU countries must designate one or more         competent authorities        responsible for:          examining applications made by companies;           granting permits to set up as a road transport operator;           declaring a person to be fit/unfit to manage a company’s transport activities;           checking that the company fulfils all the relevant requirements.         The competent authorities are also responsible for following up companies’ applications for registration within 3 months. In addition, they can declare a company unfit to manage transport activities.       Simplification and administrative cooperation       Each EU country must keep a         national electronic register        of companies authorised to be active in the road transport operator business. The competent national authorities are responsible for supervising the data in that register.       The national registers are to be interconnected, allowing the competent authorities of any EU country to consult the national electronic register of any other EU country.       Amending Regulation (EU) 2020/1055      The main changes introduced to Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 by amending Regulation (EU) 2020/1055 include the following.      Replacing the article on conditions relating to the requirement of a transport undertaking being established (Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009) in order to combat the phenomenon of letterbox companies. It thus tightens the link between the transport operator’s place of establishment and its activities.       Extending the rules to cover vans used in international transport (light commercial vehicles weighing over 2.5 tonnes).       Requiring the         European Commission        to adopt         implementing acts        laying down a list of categories, types and degrees of gravity of serious infringements of EU rules.       Introducing new administrative procedures where a transport manager or a company has seriously infringed EU rules.       Introducing new rules concerning a haulier’s good repute: the minimum period after which transport managers who have lost their good repute can have it restored is 1 year. Managers who have lost their good repute must prove that they have followed a minimum level of training or passed an examination demonstrating knowledge of the subjects listed in Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009.       Revising Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 clarifying the most serious infringements.       Requiring transport companies to demonstrate, on the basis of annual accounts certified by an auditor or a duly accredited person, that for each year it has specific levels of capital and reserves at its disposal.      FROM WHEN DOES THIS REGULATION APPLY?      Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 has applied since 4 December 2011.       Amending Regulation (EU) 2020/1055 will apply from 21 February 2022.      BACKGROUND     For more information, see:       Rules governing access to the profession        (         European Commission        ).      KEY TERMS      Letterbox companies:      companies which have been set up with the purpose of benefitting from legislative loopholes while not providing any service to clients themselves, but rather providing a front for services provided by their owners (       COM(2013) 122 final      ).

act    Regulation (EU) No 530/2012  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2012 on the accelerated phasing-in of double-hull or equivalent design requirements for single-hull oil tankers.   summary   The latest EU law on the phasing-in of  double-hull oil tankers  , adopted in 2012, retains the essence of its previous law of 2002. It merges all the amendments made to the previous law into one text to make it clearer and thus more user-friendly.  The law applies to oil tankers of  5 000 tonnes deadweight and above  which fly the flag of an EU member country, or, irrespective of their flag, which enter or leave a port or offshore terminal or anchor in an area under the jurisdiction of an EU country.  It does not, however, apply to any warship, naval auxiliary or other ship, owned or operated by a State and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service.  The regulation:   prohibits the transport to or from EU ports of heavy grades of oil in single-hull oil tankers;   lays down an accelerated phasing-in scheme for the application of the double-hull or equivalent design requirements of the  International Maritime Organization  's International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (also known as  MARPOL  ) to single-hull oil tankers, with  2015 as the final deadline  .    Background   In 2002, following a series of accidents involving oil tankers which resulted in serious pollution, the EU adopted a law requiring the phase-out of the more vulnerable  single-hull oil tankers  (where oil in the cargo tanks is separated from the seawater only by a bottom and a side plate) and their replacement by  double-hull vessels  (where the cargo tanks are surrounded by a second internal plate at a sufficient distance from the external plate).

   Innovative actions under the ERDF: 2000-06     Innovative actions under the ERDF: 2000-06     1) OBJECTIVE     To encourage less-favoured regions to invest in innovation and technological development with a view to reducing the lag in their development and enhancing their competitiveness. To encourage exchanges of experience and best practice in these areas by supporting in particular the creation of inter-regional thematic networks.     2) ACT     Communication from the Commission "The regions and the new economy" - Guidelines for innovative actions under the ERDF in 2000-06 [       COM (2001) 60      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     3) SUMMARY     In March 2000, the Lisbon European Council set Europe the target of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based society and economy in the world. However, there is a wide gap between regions in the fields of innovation and RTD (research and technological development) and in the level of use of the new information and communication technologies. This gap calls into question the principle of economic and social cohesion and balanced polycentric development at European level. Thus, to ensure that the competitiveness of the least-favoured regions is rooted as solidly as possible in their capacity to innovate, the Union is encouraging them to design and implement policies based on knowledge and information. The aim of such policies is to create high-quality jobs likely to foster sustainable development.     Based on Article 10 of the Regulation on the European Regional Development Fund (       ERDF      ), innovative actions in 1994-99 supported 350 operations relating to eight different themes: new sources of employment, culture and heritage, spatial planning (Terra), urban pilot projects, internal and external interregional co-operation (Recite II and Ecos-Ouverture), promotion of technological innovation (RIS and RTTs) and the information society (RISI I and II). This initial experiment was needed as a laboratory for experimenting with new ideas for assistance and organisational methods. It brought about new public-private partnerships, forged direct links between the regions and the European Union and stimulated interregional cooperation both inside the Union and with the applicant countries. Moreover, it provided experience which has shown how relevant the regions can be in terms of promoting innovation and contributing to the general debate on innovation in regional policy.     The Commission is continuing its action in 2002-06, and innovative actions have been included in the scope of the       general provisions      on the Structural Funds. 0.4 % of the ERDF's annual allocation is earmarked for these measures, no more than 6 % of which is to be devoted to sharing experience, creating networks and organising competitions to reward the best projects.      GENERAL PROVISIONS      The regions eligible for innovative actions in 2000-06 under the ERDF are those which are also eligible in whole or in part under Objectives 1 or 2 of the Structural Funds. A complete list of these regions, at NUTS level II in the Eurostat nomenclature, is given in Annex A to the Commission communication. The entire region is eligible for Community assistance in each case.     Innovation is by its very nature closely linked to the idea of risk and change. The innovative actions help the regions to cope better with the uncertainty arising from technological and socio-economic change. As a laboratory for experimenting with innovative development methods, the prime aim of innovative actions in the long term is to influence the quality of the assistance provided by       Objectives 1      and       2      of the Structural Funds (i.e. the "mainstream"). At the same time, these actions aim to exploit to the maximum the synergies between regional policy and other Community policies, particularly those which help to reinforce the spirit of enterprise and innovation, implement the e-Europe initiative and encourage the creation of a European research area.     The new generation of innovative actions comprises three strands:      part-financing of regional programmes of innovative actions based on three strategic themes;       accompanying measures: support for exchanges of experience and the creation of interregional networks;       organisation of competitions aimed at identifying and developing best practice.       A: Part-financing for regional programmes of innovative actions       Regional Programmes of innovative actions      To ensure simple and transparent implementation, the Commission has opted for an approach by programme rather than by individual project, as was the case for innovative actions in 1994-99. The general provisions governing the implementation, control, monitoring and evaluation of the Structural Funds also apply to the regional programmes of innovative actions.     From 2001 to 2005, no later than 31 May of each year, the competent regional authorities submit their draft programme of innovative actions directly to the Commission. The programmes may run for no more than two years and the same region may receive Community assistance no more than twice. The competent authorities may propose a second regional programme only after the Commission has approved the first one in the light of activity reports.     Each programme proposal must contain a strategy agreed between the regional partners and covering one or more of the three strategic themes described below. As a rule, programmes are no more than 25 pages long and contain the following:       a description of the region      , identifying its strengths and weaknesses;       the objectives      to be attained and       the strategy      to promote innovation;       the types of operation to be funded      (studies, pilot projects, participation in networks, technical assistance, etc.) and the timetable for implementation;       their       impact      on the ground;       the groups targeted      by the operations;       the implementation structures      (managing body, paying body, steering committee); a       description of the control, monitoring and evaluation systems      ;       the financing plan      detailing the public and private contributions; a description of the       partnership      set up (parties involved and consultation procedure);       information and publicity activities      to promote the programme, targeting final beneficiaries and the general public.     The Commission appraises the programmes for part-financing on the basis of the following criteria:       quality of the proposal      (clarity and innovative nature of the strategic approach);       potential influence      on programmes under Objectives 1 and 2 (effect on modernisation and diversification of the regional economy, the creation of high-quality long-term jobs, sustainability); cooperation with the managing authorities for the main programmes under the ERDF;       commitment and quality of the partnership      (ability to enlist the public and private sector, quality of the information and consultation process);       synergy with other EU policies and fields of Community interest      (research, information society, entrepreneurship, the environment, rural development, equal opportunities).     Community part-financing of regional programmes of innovative actions ranges from 300 000 to 3 million. The port-financing rate is generally 50 % for regions eligible in full or in part under Objective 2 and up to 80 % for Objective 1 regions.      Three strategic themes      For 2000-06 the Commission decided to reduce the number of strategic themes to three:       Regional economies based on knowledge and technological innovation,         e-EuropeRegio        : the information society at the service of regional development,        Regional identity and sustainable development.       These strategic themes are consistent with the new Structural Fund guidelines       adopted by the Commission      for the programming of Structural Fund assistance in 2000-06.      Regional economies based on knowledge and technological innovation:      helping less-favoured regions to raise their technological level     A substantial technology gap still divides the advanced and less-developed regions in the field of RTD. Facilitating cooperation between the public sector, research establishments and firms, particularly small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs), should therefore be given priority. Here are some examples of possible measures:      creating and reinforcing cooperation networks between firms (SMEs) or groups of firms, research centres and universities, training organisations, financial institutions and specialist consultants;       staff exchanges between research centres, universities and firms;       disseminating research results and technological adaptation within SMEs;       support for incubators for new enterprises which have links with universities and research centres;       use of new financial instruments (venture capital) for business start-ups.       e-EuropeRegio:      the information society at the service of regional development     The e-Europe initiative is designed to provide on-line access for all citizens (households, businesses, schools and administrations) and to foster a spirit of enterprise that encourages the funding and development of new ideas in the field of technological innovation. The initiative must also ensure that the entire process is geared towards social integration and builds social cohesion.     The less-favoured regions need to take full advantage of the opportunities offered by the information society and new technologies where the productive sector, public services and inhabitants' individual needs are concerned. Consequently, through its powerful networking effects, the information society can contribute to the geographical and economic opening-up of these regions and help them capitalise on their assets.     With regard to the "e-EuropeRegio" theme, the regional programmes of innovative actions cover the following areas:      establishing innovative strategies and experimenting with advanced digital technology for the benefit of specific areas such as rural, remote and otherwise isolated areas;       improving digital and mobile services for young people, the elderly and the disabled (e.g. public Internet access points);       encouraging SMEs to include electronic commerce in their development strategies and to find suitable ways of training their employees;       creating and developing specific areas for experimenting with innovation.      3)       Regional identity and sustainable development:      promoting regional cohesion and competitiveness through an integrated approach to economic, environmental, cultural and social activities     With ever stiffer competition between the regions to attract and create activities conducive to sustainable development, innovative actions are helping the regions to develop their specific strengths. These comparative advantages vary widely: they may be social (a highly-qualified population or specific skills), cultural (heritage, cultural diversity, local traditions, cuisine), geographical or environmental (preserving the ecosystem, quality of the climate).     Under this third strategic theme, regional programmes of innovative actions recommend the following fields of action:      assistance for micro-companies in the craft or traditional handicraft industries aimed at improving their technological awareness;       assistance for SMEs wishing to benefit from research activities in their region;       developing culture-based and ecological tourism;       developing new forms of local services;       new working relationships between the public and private sectors;       developing innovative schemes targeted at environmental management, adoption of clean technologies and recycling of waste.       B: Accompanying measures: support for exchange of experiences and the creation of interregional networks      The European Commission strongly encourages the regions implementing innovative actions to exchange experience and best practice among themselves, in particular by creating networks. To achieve this, the regions concerned have two options:      Regions wishing to participate in networks (or any other form of exchange of experience) either as a participant or as a lead partner may include a specific action for this purpose in their proposal for a regional programme of innovative actions. They should set aside between 1 % and 3 % of their total budget for this purpose.       Groups of a minimum of five regions from at least five Member States may submit specific networking programme proposals to the Commission, appointing one region as the lead partner to submit the proposal. Programme proposals must reach the Commission no later than 31 May each year until 2004. The duration of programmes may vary depending on the proposals but they must be completed by 31 December 2006.Regions may participate in one or more specific network programmes but may act as a "lead partner" in only one programme at a time. New members may join a network, provided that this does not involve an increase in Community part-financing, which may not exceed 50 % of the total budget of the programme.The specific network programmes must contain the following information:         a description of the actions planned        (conferences, seminars, study trips, websites, newsletters), preferably based on only one of the three strategic themes;         a detailed work plan        and         timetable        for implementation; links with mainstream Structural Fund programmes; the         bodies responsible for implementation         and management        (the lead region, managing body and paying body); practical arrangements for exchange of information and cooperation between the partners;         financing plan        showing the different public and private contributions.      Regions wishing to establish specific measures of interregional cooperation involving regional innovation which go beyond networking are invited to submit an application for part-financing under the Community Initiative       Interreg III       C      , which aims to stimulate cross-border cooperation in general and interregional cooperation in particular.      C: Organisation of prize competitions      In 2000-06, the Commission will publish two announcements of competitions in the Official Journal and on the Regional Policy DG's Inforegio site relating to the strategic themes.

   Passenger car related taxes     Passenger car related taxes     This proposal for a directive provides for the restructuring of European Union (EU) countries’ passenger car related taxation systems with a view to improving the functioning of the internal market. It aims to remove the tax obstacles to permanently transferring passenger cars from one EU country to another. By restructuring the basis on which passenger cars are taxed, the proposed directive also aims to promote environmental sustainability in terms of carbon dioxide emissions.     PROPOSAL     Proposal for a Council Directive of 5 July 2005 on passenger car related taxes [       COM(2005) 261      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This proposal for a directive aims to improve the functioning of the internal market and reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars. By restructuring European Union (EU) countries’ systems for taxing passenger cars the proposal for a directive aims to remove fiscal obstacles to the free movement of passenger cars from one EU country to another.     Regarding taxes on passenger cars, the Commission proposes measures such as:      phasing out car registration taxes (RT) over a transitional period of five to ten years;       establishing a system for reimbursing registration taxes for passenger cars registered in one EU country and then exported or permanently transferred to another EU country;       introducing an element linked to CO2 emissions into the tax base of annual circulation tax (ACT) and registration taxes.       Registration taxes      Under the current situation, RTs can lead to double taxation in cases where citizens move their permanent residence from one EU country to another or when a second-hand car is brought in from another EU country. Since these taxes can therefore create obstacles to the free movement of citizens as well as lead to a fragmentation of the market for used cars, it is proposed to phase them out.     Gradually abolishing RT over a transitional period of five to ten years will give those EU countries which are currently applying high RTs sufficient time to restructure their tax system and will also give holders of used cars protection against any immediate loss of their commercial value.      Refunding registration taxes      The purpose of establishing a system for refunding some of the RTs charged when registering any passenger car which is to be exported or permanently transferred to another EU country is to avoid double taxation in the interim period until RTs will be phased out. Moreover, clear rules are established for the calculation of the residual value of the RT to be refunded in the above cases.      Minimum tax revenue in terms of CO2 emissions      A link between CO2 emissions and the tax bases for RT and ACT is introduced based on the CO2 emissions per kilometre of each passenger car.     The total tax revenue generated by the CO2-related element of the annual circulation and registration taxes should be at least:      25% on 31 December 2008;       50% on 31 December 2010.       Background      The fact that there are differing systems for taxing passenger cars in the EU results in tax obstacles (such as double taxation) and impedes the smooth functioning of the internal market. The purpose of the measures put forward in this proposal for a directive is to remove tax obstacles to the cross-border transfer of cars. The new structure approximates the systems for taxing passenger cars applied by the EU countries but does not harmonise taxation levels in EU countries or oblige them to introduce new taxes.     Use of the tax system to promote fuel-efficient cars is one of the three pillars of the strategy for reducing CO2 emissions adopted by the EU in 1995. The other two pillars are consumer information, achieved by means of labels showing a vehicle’s CO2 emissions, and a voluntary commitment by automobile manufacturers to reduce CO2 emissions.

The Commission finds that, despite the progress made on achieving the voluntary target of 140 g of CO2/km by 2008-09, the target of 120 g of CO2/km that the EU has set itself will not be achieved by 2012 without additional measures. In order to achieve this target, the Commission proposes mandatory reductions of CO2 emissions to 130 g of CO2/km by means of better engine technologies (to be achieved by the automobile manufacturers) and a further reduction of 10 g of CO2/km through other technological improvements (tyre pressure monitoring systems, more effective air-conditioning systems, etc.) and an increased use of biofuels. Furthermore, the Commission intends to promote the purchase of fuel-efficient vehicles, particularly by improving vehicle labelling and by introducing legislation that would enable car tax systems in the EU countries to take account of CO2 emissions.

act   Regulation (EC) No  881/2004  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 establishing a European Railway Agency [  see amending act(s)  ].   summary   The progressive establishment of a European railway area without frontiers requires Community action in the field of the technical regulations applicable to railways with regard to both the technical aspects and the safety aspects. Simultaneous pursuit of the goals of safety and interoperability requires substantial technical work which must be led by a specialised body: the European Railway Agency (ERA), hereinafter referred to as the Agency.  The main objectives of the European Railway Agency are to:   increase the safety of the European railway system;   improve its level of interoperability;   contribute towards establishing a European certification system for vehicle maintenance;   contribute towards setting up a uniform training and recognition system for train drivers.    Safety of the railway system   The Agency must provide the necessary technical assistance to implement Directive  2004/49/EC  on safety on Europe’s railways. The main tasks assigned to it are:   prepare and propose common safety methods and indicators and annually verify that the security objectives are being met by Member States;   draw on the support of groups of experts in the sector placed under its responsibility;   consult social partners and organisations representing rail freight customers and passengers at European level;   ensure safety performance is continuously monitored;   produce a public report every two years;   keep a database on railway safety;   ensure the networking of and cooperation between national rail safety and investigation authorities, with the aim of encouraging the exchange of experience and developing a common rail safety culture.    Interoperability of the railway system   The  interoperability of the European railway system  aims at rendering the various national rail systems of the Member States compatible by removing or reducing the technical barriers.  In order to improve its level of interoperability, the Agency organises and manages work aimed at creating and updating the Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSIs). The TSIs aim at ensuring that the essential requirements of Directive  2008/57/EC  on the interoperability of the European railway system are met. Furthermore, the Agency publishes a report every two years on the progress made regarding interoperability.   Vehicle maintenance   Vehicle maintenance is an important part of rail safety. For this reason, the Agency is responsible for formulating recommendations to regarding in particular the certification system of entities responsible for maintaining carriages and other rail vehicles.  The Agency is also responsible for producing a report on the implementation of this certification system.   Railway personnel   The training and skills of train drivers are important elements both for rail safety and for the interoperability of the European railway system. The Agency has the mission of contributing towards harmonising the vocational skills of train drivers, under the framework of Directive  2007/59/CE  relating to the certification of train drivers in the EU.  The Agency must cooperate with the competent authorities in particular, in order to ensure the interoperability of the licence registers and the certificates given to drivers, to assess the development of their certification and to produce a report on the improvements which could be made.   Organisation   The Agency comprises an Administrative Board which meets at least twice a year. Its main duties are to adopt the annual work programme and the Agency’s general report. The Administrative Board comprises representatives from each Member State, the Commission and six categories of professionals from the sector: railway undertakings, infrastructure managers, railway industry, worker unions, passengers and freight customers.  Furthermore, the Agency is led by a Chairperson appointed by the Administrative Board. The principal mission of the Chairperson is to prepare and implement the work programme. The Chairperson is also responsible for managing the budget of the Agency.  The Agency does not have decision-making powers as such, but it can present opinions, recommendations and proposals to the Commission. It is independent, but works in close cooperation with experts in the field.

   Euro-Mediterranean Cooperation     Euro-Mediterranean Cooperation     1) OBJECTIVE     To define the broad lines of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation in the field of transport and energy for the period 2000-2006 in order to inject new momentum into the transport sector and to boost the existing momentum in the energy sector.     The Euro-Mediterranean energy forum, which will be held in September 2007, will provide the occasion to highlight progress made in different areas of cooperation in terms of energy and to define the future guidelines as well as the priorities for 2007-2010.     2) COMMUNITY MEASURE     Communication from the Commission to the Council and to the European Parliament of 7 March 2001, "Enhancing Euro-Mediterranean cooperation on transport and energy."     3) CONTENTS      Context      Relations between the European Union and Mediterranean countries are governed by "The Euro-Mediterranean partnership" set up in Barcelona in 1995 ("The Barcelona Process"). The partnership is made up of 12 partner countries around the Mediterranean: Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, Palestinian Authority, Syria (Mashrek), Tunisia (Maghreb) and Turkey (Libya has observer status). It covers a large range of policies.     This Communication is fully in line with several recent Community initiatives aiming to consolidate the Euro-Mediterranean partnership (one of the Commission's priorities for 2002), particularly the September 2000 Communication "Reinvigorating the Barcelona Process." It also draws on more general Commission initiatives such as the Green Paper on the       security of energy supply      and the draft White Paper on the common transport policy.     The energy and transport policies are a key element of the partnership for both the EU Member States and the Mediterranean partners because of the planned creation of a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area by 2010 (main objective of the Barcelona Declaration) and prognoses that there will be a significant population increase in the 12 Mediterranean partner countries and the pressure that this will create in the two sectors concerned.      Transport dimension      The most important modes of transport in this region are air and sea transport. Restructuring of the sector is essential in order to attract investments to the region and also for the efficient running of the Euro-Mediterranean free trade area being developed. Although there is momentum in this field with the Euro-Mediterranean Transport Forum, the results obtained to date fall far short of the Barcelona mandate. Some of the key points of this mandate are: infrastructure; organisation of transport operations and freedom to provide international transport services; safety and environmental protection.     The Commission has identified four priority fields: administrative reform, the definition and promotion of a multimodal trans-Mediterranean transport network sea and air transport and the global navigation satellite system (       Galileo      ).      Administrative Reform      The current institutional and regulatory framework in the sector creates many bottlenecks in the transport system (State influence, insufficient competition, etc.). Thus the Commission identifies three main points for reform:      adaptation of the institutional, legislative and regulatory frameworks;       harmonisation of standards (social, technical, environmental, safety, etc.);       improvement of the interface between transport services and the customs and immigration authorities, banking and insurance sectors.       Definition and promotion of a multimodal trans      -       Mediterranean transport network      The characteristics of such a network are:      the development of a multimodal air-sea transport plan followed in a second phase by overland links (in particular links between ports and their hinterland);       interconnection with the Trans-European Networks (TENs);       a South-South dimension.      An in-depth study will be carried out on infrastructure funding. A public-private partnership is envisaged using MEDA funds (financial instrument of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership) for feasibility studies and preparatory work. In the context of sustainable development, the development of infrastructures must take account of environmental impact.      Sea and air transport      The priority areas for these two transport modes are: safety, short-sea shipping and harmonisation of air transport policies on a Euro-Mediterranean level.     The Communication sets out to initiate a debate on improving the safety of shipping, in particular the transport of dangerous substances and passenger transport. Recent disasters at sea (Erika, Ievoli Sun) have highlighted the importance of maritime safety, particularly with regard to the transport of oil and chemical substances. Such accidents have particularly serious consequences for an enclosed sea such as the Mediterranean.     Air transport safety must also be improved. Close cooperation with the EU and the candidate countries could be considered in order to provide general assistance, particularly technical, to support the Mediterranean countries.     Short sea shipping takes on a strategic importance in the Mediterranean given the distances involved and the lack of practical overland routes. Therefore this mode of transport should be made more attractive by tackling the technical, administrative and regulatory aspects of to short sea shipping, particularly in ports.     Harmonisation of transport policies is of crucial importance given the stakes for tourism in the region. The opening up of this sector must be considered and discussions could be initiated to this end between the European Union and the Mediterranean partners.      Global navigation satellite system (Galileo)      The extension of this system to the Mediterranean is an important tool with regard to creating a trans-Mediterranean transport network and coherent transport systems at regional and global levels. It is also essential to include the Mediterranean partners in Galileo, the European Union programme aiming to develop a European satellite navigation system with global coverage.      The energy dimension      Energy is an important sector for collaboration for two main reasons linked to security of the EU's energy supply:      geographical importance of the partner countriesThe Mediterranean countries' geographical proximity to the EU, an energy importer, and to countries exporting to the EU e.g. from the Gulf and Caucasus;       significant oil and gas reserves in some partner countries which offer an important security of energy supply for the EU, which greatly depends on external energy sources.      Given the expected large increase in the Mediterranean population, these countries must mobilise additional financial resources.     Euro-Mediterranean cooperation is currently slightly more advanced in the field of energy than in transport. A cooperation framework was set up - the Euro-Mediterranean Energy Forum and an Action Plan for the period 1998-2002 has been implemented.     The Granada Forum 2000 (third forum) is a significant step in the cooperation process. Priorities have been established in four main areas.      Reform of the legislative and regulatory framework and restructuring of the energy industry      Reform of the legal and regulatory framework of the sector would be carried out on the lines of that already undertaken by the Member States. The partner countries are generally characterised by a centralised, State-controlled monopoly but in order to satisfy market competition requirements, overall reform is necessary. This is even more imperative given the partnership's aim to create a free trade area (FTA).     Some liberalisation measures must be implemented, including the establishment of independent regulatory authorities, separation of activity types, reduction of subsidies and promotion of private participation.     The EU is also encouraging the Mediterranean partners to accede to the       Energy Charter Treaty      .      Integration of Mediterranean markets and development of interconnections      With a view to enhancing the security of energy supply, the interconnection of infrastructure between Mediterranean countries and also between them and the EU is planned. Modernisation of the existing infrastructure should also be a priority. The enlargement of INOGATE, the EU programme aiming to promote the construction and interconnection of oil and gas infrastructures between the EU and regions such as the Caspian Sea will also be considered.      Sustainable development and use of renewable energy      Sustainable development for partner countries in this sector is based on energy efficiency requirements, energy saving and environmental protection. Renewable energy has a major role to play and also represents the diversification of energy sources. The use of this energy should therefore significantly contribute to the restructuring of the sector. Cooperation between the EU and the partner countries may also include the use of flexibility mechanisms in the framework of the       Kyoto      objectives.     The Euro-Mediterranean energy forum, which will be held in September 2007, will provide the occasion to highlight progress made in different areas of cooperation in terms of energy and to define the future guidelines as well as the priorities for 2007-2010.      4) deadline for implementation of the legislation in the member states       Not applicable       5) date of entry into force (if different from above)       6) references         COM(2001) 126          finalNot yet published in the Official Journal        7) follow-up work       8) commission implementing measures      Last updated: 01.06.2007  
summary of   Regulation (EC) No 693/2003 establishing a specific Facilitated Transit Document, a Facilitated Rail Transit Document and amending the Common Consular Instructions and the Common Manual   what is the aim of the regulation  It seeks to establish a facilitated transit document (FTD)  *  and a facilitated rail transit document (FRTD)  *  for the specific and direct transit by land of non-EU country nationals who must necessarily cross the territory of one or more EU countries in order to travel between two parts of their own country which are not geographically contiguous.   key points    Scope and validity    The FTD and the FRTD have the same value as transit visas and are territorially valid for the issuing EU country.   The FTD is valid for a maximum period of up to 3 years and transit based on the FTD must not exceed 24 hours.   The FRTD is valid for a maximum period of up to 3 months and transit based on the FRTD will not exceed 6 hours.   No FTD/FRTD can be affixed in a travel document that has expired or with a period of validity shorter than that of the FTD/FRTD.    Conditions and issuing procedure    To obtain an FTD/FRTD, applicants must meet the following conditions:   possess a valid document, authorising them to cross external borders;   not be persons for whom an alert has been issued for the purposes of refusing entry;   not be considered to be a threat to public policy or the international relations of any of the EU countries;   for the FTD, have valid reasons for frequent travelling between the two parts of the territory of their country.     The application for an FTD/FRTD is made to the consular authorities of an EU country. Applicants must submit documentation demonstrating the need for frequent travel, such as documents concerning family links or social, economic or other motives.   The fee corresponding to the administrative costs of processing the application for an FTD is €5.   The FRTD is issued free of charge.    Issuing and refusal of the document    FTDs and FRTDs are issued by the consular offices of the EU countries and may not be issued at the border.   The procedures, and appeal in cases where the consular post of an EU country refuses to examine an application or issue an FTD/FRTD, are governed by national law of the respective country.   If an FTD/FRTD is refused, the reason must be communicated to the applicant, where required by national law.   Penalties are imposed on the holder of the FTD/FRTD in the case of misuse. Penalties must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive, and include the possibility of cancelling or revoking the FTD/FRTD.    Decisions to issue FTDs/FRTDs    EU countries deciding to issue the FTD and the FRTD must communicate this decision to the  Council  and the  European Commission  and the latter will publish it in the  Official Journal  (OJ).   If EU countries decide to stop issuing the FTD and the FRTD they must communicate that decision to the Council and the Commission and the latter will publish it in the OJ.   The Commission will report to the  European Parliament  and the Council on the functioning of the FTD/FRTD scheme at the latest 3 years after the entry into force of the first decision taken by an EU country to issue FTDs/FRTDs.    Uniform formats   FTDs and FRTDs are produced in the form of a uniform format (sticker) and have the same value as transit visas. They conform to the specifications set out in Annexes I and II to Regulation (EC) No  694/2003  , adopted at the same time as Regulation (EC) No 693/2003.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 18 April 2003.   background   For more information, see:    Kaliningrad: Commission proposes set of measures to ease transit after enlargement  — press release (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Facilitated transit document (FTD):  a specific authorisation allowing for a facilitated transit, which may be issued by EU countries for multiple entries by any means of land transport. The FTD must be issued in the form of uniform formats in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 694/2003.   Facilitated rail transit document (FRTD):  a specific authorisation allowing for facilitated transit, which may be issued by EU countries for a single entry and return by rail. The FRTD must be issued in the form of uniform formats in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 694/2003.
act   Directive  2000/25/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2000 on action to be taken against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants by engines intended to power agricultural or forestry tractors and amending Council Directive 74/150/EEC [  See amending acts  ].   summary   This Directive details the action to be taken against air pollution by agricultural or forestry tractors. It therefore aims to reduce the level of pollutants emitted while ensuring the smooth functioning of the internal market.   Vehicles involved   This Directive deals with the requirements concerning emissions by agricultural and forestry tractors . They concern, in particular, the definition of the component type-approval procedures applying to engines intended to be fitted to tractors and thus also the definition of the type-approval procedures for such vehicles in terms of their pollutant emissions.   Obligations to be complied with   The manufacturer of the vehicle shall submit an application for type-approval concerning the pollutants emitted. They must provide certain information relating to the vehicle, such as the type of motor.  The manufacturer shall also comply with certain specifications concerning tests, engine marking and the conformity of production.  Replacement motors shall comply with the limit values which were applicable to the motor to be replaced at the time when the later was placed on the market.   Flexibility mechanism   A limited number of tractors may be placed in service on the condition that they are equipped with a motor approved in accordance with the requirements relating to the emissions limits of the phase immediately prior to that which is applicable.  The number of these tractors placed on the market under the framework of the flexibility mechanism shall not exceed 40 % of the annual number of tractors placed on the market by the manufacturer.   Limit values   The Directive has the same test requirements as have been adopted for  off-road mobile machinery  and the corresponding limit values for levels of emissions.  At the same time, the Directive comes within the field of the type-approval procedure for agricultural or forestry tractors put in place by  Directive 2003/37/EC  .  As it draws a distinction between four chemical pollutants - carbon monoxide (CO), unburned hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxide (NOx) and particulates (PT) - the Directive supplements Directive  77/537/EEC  on action to be taken against pollutants emitted by diesel engines intended to power tractors.  This directive is repealed by Regulation (EU) No  167/2013  with effect from 1 January 2016.

   The contribution of taxation and customs policies to the Lisbon Strategy     The contribution of taxation and customs policies to the Lisbon Strategy     The Commission has launched a plan for EU-wide taxation and customs measures that would help the EU to achieve its Lisbon objectives. The co-existence of 25 national taxation systems makes it impossible to take full advantage of the single market. The proposed measures are aimed at reducing the negative effects these co-existing national tax systems can have on market integration     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 25 October 2005 to the Council and the European Parliament - The Contribution of Taxation and Customs Policies to the Lisbon Strategy [       COM(2005) 532      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     In 2005 the Commission proposed to reinvigorate the       Lisbon Strategy      . This communication describes the measures and initiatives taken by the European Community to reach the Lisbon Strategy's taxation and customs objectives.     These measures are aimed at:      making the European Union a more attractive place to invest and work;       boosting growth by increasing and improving knowledge and innovation.       INVESTMENT AND MARKET INTEGRATION      The taxation and customs measures proposed in the communication are aimed at making the EU a more attractive place to invest and work by:      extending and deepening the internal market;       ensuring open and competitive markets inside and outside the EU;       improving European and national legislation.       Extending and deepening the Internal Market      National tax systems have a negative effect on EU market integration. Remaining obstacles should be lifted to take full advantage of the single market. The Commission proposes five categories of measures.     Because different       company taxation systems      co-exist, cross-border activities are treated differently to similar domestic activities. The first measure is to introduce a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base for EU businesses (CCCTB), a strategy the Commission has been working towards since 2001.     A second series of measures is aimed at simplifying the       tax environment      . In order to create a level playing field, corporate taxation obstacles have to be removed concerning:     VAT compliance obligations;      experimental application of the Home State Taxation approach;        VAT        rules concerning international services;       the VAT rules on financial services;       the rules governing the exemptions of services in the public interest.      A third series of measures is aimed at removing       cross-border tax barriers      faced by EU businesses. Pending the introduction of the CCCTB, the Commission plans to put in place:      a system of cross-border loss relief;       a system to manage         transfer pricing        ;       measures to abolish a number of indirect taxes, such as         capital duty        .      The fourth measure is aimed at creating a new       car taxation      strategy to replace Member State registration taxes.     The fifth measure concerns a new policy to combat distortions due to       fraud      and tax evasion.      Open and competitive markets       Pirated and counterfeit products      violate the industrial and intellectual property rights of EU businesses. That is why it action to protect intellectual property rights is necessary. In October 2005, the Commission adopted a communication on a customs response to latest trends in counterfeiting and piracy.     To improve customs legislation and promote        e        Customs      the Commission has adopted communications on:      creating a simpler and paperless environment for customs and trade (         eCustoms        ). This communication is part of the modernisation of the         Community Customs Code        and the         eGovernment        programme;       the role of customs in the         integrated management of external borders        to simplify administrative formalities.       Improving European and national legislation      The modernisation of VAT rules contained in the       6th VAT Directive      is necessary to provide clear rules to traders. A more uniform application of these rules in combination with binding provisions would help to eliminate the current divergences at the Community level. Thus, a more uniform application of the VAT system will help European businesses.      KNOWLEDGE AND INNOVATION      With a view to boosting growth by increasing and improving knowledge and innovation, this communication presents tax and customs measures aimed at:      favouring investment in research and development (R&D);       facilitating the sustainable use of resources.       Research and development (R&D)      The Commission proposes to adopt guidelines on R&D tax incentives to increase and improve R&D investment. These guidelines should:      set out the key EU legal conditions for such tax incentives;       highlight best practices as regards R&D tax treatment and incentives in some Member States;       set out the political message and contents of possible future initiatives directed to Member States.       Sustainable use of resources      Indirect taxation can play a significant role in the sustainable use of resources, especially in the fields of energy, transport and the environment. The Directive on the       taxation of energy products      and taxation of commercial diesel, energy and cars are examples of this.

   State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty     State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty     The new guidelines give details of the Commission’s approach in cases where public authorities grant financial support to firms in difficulty. Moreover, the Commission recently adopted a Communication on the application of State aid rules to measures taken in relation to financial institutions in the context of the global financial crisis.     ACT     Communication from the Commission -       Community guidelines      on state aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty [Official Journal C 244 of 1.10.2004].     SUMMARY     The guidelines clarify the Commission's approach in cases where the public authorities grant financial support to firms in difficulty       *      . Under the general principle of the prohibition of state aid (Article 87(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Community), aid granted to firms in difficulty must not be allowed to become the rule. The exit of inefficient firms is a normal part of the operation of the market and, while rescuing and restructuring aid may keep in existence firms in difficulty, this is generally at the expense of their competitors.      Financial contribution from the beneficiary firm to the restructuring      The guidelines are based on the principle whereby, in any restructuring operation, the beneficiary is required to finance a substantial proportion of its restructuring costs.     Depending on the size of the beneficiary, thresholds determine its contribution to the overall cost of restructuring: at least 50 % for large firms, 40 % for medium-sized firms and 25 % for small firms. The guidelines are, therefore, concerned especially with large firms operating throughout the European Union. Such firms generally have large market shares and the state aid granted to them has a more appreciable impact on competition and trade.     The beneficiary's contribution has a twofold purpose: it will demonstrate that the markets (owners, creditors) believe in the feasibility of the return to viability within a reasonable period of time, and it ensures that the aid is limited to the minimum required to restore viability while limiting distortion of competition.     A substantial contribution from the beneficiary to the restructuring was previously required under the 1999 guidelines. The 2004 guidelines reaffirm with greater clarity the principle that the contribution must be real and free of aid.      "One time, last time" principle      The guidelines also stipulate a uniform period of ten years during which the beneficiary of the aid may not receive any additional rescue or restructuring aid. This "one time, last time" principle is designed to prevent repeated granting of rescue or restructuring aid that keeps firms artificially in business. An important exception to this rule is where restructuring aid follows the granting of rescue aid as part of a single restructuring operation.      Definition of rescue and restructuring aid      The guidelines extend the concept of rescue aid so as to allow the beneficiary to take urgent measures, even of a structural nature. Firms in difficulty may already need to take certain urgent structural measures to halt or reduce down a worsening of their financial situation during the rescue phase.     Under the 1999 guidelines, no restructuring measure financed through state aid could be undertaken during the rescue phase. Admittedly, rescue and restructuring involve the interplay of different mechanisms but are often two phases of the same operation. Such a strict distinction between rescue and restructuring has thus given rise to difficulties.     Accordingly, rescue aid is by nature temporary and reversible. Its objective is to allow time to analyse the circumstances which gave rise to the difficulties and to develop an appropriate plan to remedy those difficulties. Restructuring will be based on a practical plan for restoring a firm's long-term viability. Any aid granted following the adoption and implementation of a restructuring or liquidation plan for which aid has been requested will be considered as restructuring aid.      GENERAL CONDITIONS FOR AUTHORISING AID      Common rules apply to rescue aid and restructuring aid:      the firm must qualify as a firm in difficulty within the meaning of the guidelines;       a recently established firm may not receive rescue and restructuring aid for the first three years of its existence.      In order to be approved, rescue aid must:      be in the form of loan guarantees or loans granted at an interest rate comparable to those for loans to healthy firms;       be reimbursed within a period of not more than six months after disbursement of the first instalment;       be warranted on the grounds of serious social difficulties;       have no unduly adverse spillover effects on other Member States;       be accompanied, on notification, by an undertaking given by the Member State concerned to communicate to the Commission within six months a restructuring plan, a liquidation plan or proof that the loan has been reimbursed in full and/or that the guarantee has been terminated;       be restricted to the amount needed to keep the firm in business for the period during which the aid is authorised;       respect the "one time, last time" principle.      Restructuring aid raises particular competition concerns. The general principle is to allow restructuring aid to be granted only in circumstances in which any distortions of competition will be offset by the benefits flowing from the firm's survival. Authorisation will be granted only if strict conditions are met:      a restructuring plan must be implemented that restores the firm's long-term viability within a reasonable timescale;       compensatory measures must be taken to prevent or to minimise the risks of distortion of competition (divestment of assets, reductions in capacity or market presence, etc.);       the aid must be limited to the strict minimum and the rules on the beneficiary's contribution must be complied with;       specific conditions may be attached by the Commission to the authorisation of aid;       the restructuring plan must be implemented in full;       the Commission must be in a position to make sure that the restructuring plan is being implemented properly, through regular reports communicated by the Member State concerned.      The conditions for authorising restructuring aid are, however, less strict where the aid is granted to small firms since it affects competition less than aid for medium-sized and large firms.      SCOPE      The guidelines are based on Article 87(2) and (3) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which stipulates that aid falling within the scope of Article 87(1) may be regarded as being compatible with the common market.     They apply to firms in difficulty in all sectors, including agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture, subject to certain conditions. The coal and steel sectors are, however, excluded from the scope of the guidelines.      DATE OF APPLICATION AND DURATION      The Commission will apply the new guidelines with effect from 10 October 2004. Only state aid notified after that date will be subject to them as they do not have retrospective effect.       Key terms used in the act         Firm in difficulty: a firm is regarded as being in difficulty where it is unable, whether through its own resources or with the funds it is able to obtain from its owner/shareholders or creditors, to stem losses which, without outside intervention by the public authorities, will almost certainly condemn it to going out of business in the short or medium term.       RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission – Temporary Community framework for State aid measures to support access to finance in the current financial and economic crisis [Official Journal         C16/3 of 22.1.2009        ].      This Communication aims to introduce a temporary State aid system in order to cope with the failures resulting from the economic and financial crisis that began in October 2008. The temporary additional measures provided for meet two principal objectives:      to unblock bank lending to companies;       to encourage companies to continue investing in the future, in particular in sustainable growth.      To achieve these objectives, Member States may, under certain conditions and until the end of 2010, provide in particular:      maximum flat-rate aid of EUR 500 000 per company during the first two years, to help companies overcome the current difficulties;       State guarantees for loans accompanied by a premium reduction;       subsidised loans, in particular for the production of green products (meeting environmental protection standards early or going beyond such standards);       aid in the form of risk capital, which may be up to EUR 2.5 million per SME and per year (instead of the current EUR 1.5 million) provided that at least 30 % (instead of the current 50 %) of the investment costs are met by private investors.       Communication from the Commission on the application of State aid rules to measures taken in relation to financial institutions in the context of the current global financial crisis [Official Journal         C 270/02 of 25.10.2008        ].      This Communication clarifies the application of State aid rules to emergency measures aimed to offset losses due to the October 2008 financial crisis.     Public intervention should be decided at national level within a coordinated framework and on the basis of a certain number of European Union common principles. Two types of financial institution receiving aid are distinguished with consequences for restructuring when State aid has been received:      financial institutions which are fundamentally healthy and whose difficulties of access to liquidity is exclusively a result of general market conditions;       financial institutions with endogenous problems due to their business mode or business practices and whose weaknesses have been exposed and exacerbated by the crisis in the financial markets.      The Communication covers two main types of measure taken with regard to these institutions:      guarantees covering financial institutions’ debts. These include in particular general guarantees protecting retail deposits and liabilities, some types of interbank deposits and short and medium-term debt instruments. The duration and amount of these guarantees must be limited to the minimum necessary and the guarantees must include appropriate mechanisms to minimise undue distortions of competition;       the recapitalisation of financial institutions. Public funds are provided in order to strengthen the capital base of the institutions directly. This injection of capital must be limited to the strict minimum, so as not to encourage the financial institution to engage in other activities or in an aggressive commercial strategy.      Member States may also accompany this aid and restructuring with the provisions of public funds, in particular from the central bank.     Last updated: 19.06.2009  
   Placing on the market of aquaculture animals and products     Placing on the market of aquaculture animals and products     The European Union has created a secure monitoring framework for placing on the market and importing aquaculture animals and products. This framework is based on the approval of disease-free regions and on categorising different types of diseases to which different health rules will apply.     ACT     Council Directive       91/67/EEC      of 28 January 1991 concerning the animal health conditions governing the placing on the market of aquaculture animals and products [       See amending acts      ]     SUMMARY     This Directive creates a framework designed to overcome obstacles to trade in aquaculture animals while at the same time avoiding the spread of infectious diseases, particularly in disease-free regions of the European Union.     This framework is based on the identification of zones or farms that are free from serious endemic disease. The Directive lays down the criteria and procedures for the granting, maintenance, suspension, restoration and withdrawal of approval of such zones and farms.     It also stipulates the documents required for transport within these zones: aquaculture animals and products must be accompanied by a movement document and a health certificate.     The Directive also lays down Community rules applying to importation from non-member countries in order to protect the health of aquaculture animals in the Member States.     The diseases and the animals likely to be affected are set out in three separate lists:      an exotic disease, infectious salmon anaemia, for which all infected fish are destroyed as quickly as possible and any suspected cases of infection lead to a ban on animal movements not authorised by a veterinarian;       four serious endemic diseases which must be eradicated in the long term: infectious haematopoietic necrosis and viral haemorrhagic septicaemia for fish, and bonamiosis and marteiliosis for molluscs;       some less dangerous diseases for which control and eradication measures are less stringent.      This Directive will be repealed and replaced from 1 August 2008 by Council Directive       2006/88/EC      (see "Related Acts" below).

act    Regulation (EU, EURATOM) No 966/2012  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002. [Official Journal L 298 of 26.10.2012]   summary    WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF REVIEWING THE FINANCIAL REGULATION?   The EU is modernising its financial procedures in order to better serve the achievement of the objectives of Europe 2020. Broadly speaking, the changes focus on three areas:   Simplification: cutting red tape, speeding up procedures and shifting the focus from paperwork to performance;   Accountability: ensuring enhanced sound financial management and the protection of the EU's financial interests;   Innovation: introducing financial mechanisms which will enable the mobilisation of third-party funds as leverage on EU funds.    WHAT’S NEW?    Specific improvements to focus more on results:    no obligation to open separate bank accounts;   speeding up payments to beneficiaries (30, 60 or 90 days depending on the complexity of the deliverables);   easier procedures (using lump sums and flat rates) for smaller amounts;   less paperwork.    Increased accountability:    the new rules will increase the accountability of Member States, especially in regional policy;   national authorities will have to sign and submit annual declarations certifying that EU funds have been used properly.    Strengthening control:    when irregularities occur, mechanisms for financial corrections will be triggered and the Commission will publish decisions imposing penalties for misuse of EU funds.    Flexibility:    various financial instruments - loans, equity or guarantees - will be used to multiply the financial impact of EU funds;   new possibilities will be created for public-private partnerships (PPPs).    Pooling resources together:    the EU will be able to create EU trust funds pooling its own resources with those of its Member States and other donors in order to better coordinate and deliver external aid and increase its visibility.

summary of   Regulation (Euratom) No 1314/2013 on the Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community   what is the aim of the regulation  It establishes the Research and Training Programme (2014-2018) of the  European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom)  complementing the  Horizon 2020  EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation.   key points   In line with the  Euratom Treaty  , the Euratom Research and Training Programme runs for 5 years (from 2014 to 2018), unlike other EU research programmes which last for 7 years. The general objective of the programme is to pursue nuclear research and training activities with an emphasis on continuous improvement of nuclear safety, security and radiation protection, notably to potentially contribute to the long-term decarbonisation of the energy system in a safe, efficient and secure way.  This general objective is implemented through the form of  indirect  and  direct actions  .   Indirect actions  are research and innovation activities to which the EU provides financial support and which are undertaken by external participants such as companies, universities and research centres.  The Euratom Programme indirect actions have the following specific objectives:   supporting the safety of nuclear systems;   contributing to the development of safe, longer-term solutions for the management of ultimate nuclear waste, including final geological disposal as well as partitioning and transmutation;   supporting the development and sustainability of nuclear expertise and excellence in the EU;   supporting radiation protection and development of medical applications of radiation, including the secure and safe supply and use of radioisotopes;   moving towards demonstrating the feasibility of fusion as a power source by exploiting existing and future fusion facilities;   laying the foundations for future fusion power plants by developing materials, technologies and conceptual design;   promoting innovation and industrial competitiveness;   ensuring availability and use of research infrastructures of pan-European relevance.    Direct actions  are research and innovation activities undertaken by the  European Commission  through its  Joint Research Centre (JRC)  .  The Euratom programme direct actions have the following specific objectives:   improving nuclear safety including:   nuclear reactor and fuel safety;   waste management, including final geological disposal as well as partitioning and transmutation;   decommissioning;   emergency preparedness;     improving nuclear security, including:   nuclear safeguards;   non-proliferation;   combating illicit trafficking;   nuclear forensics;     increasing excellence in the nuclear science base for standardisation;   fostering knowledge management, education and training;   supporting the EU’s policy on nuclear safety and security.    Budget   The budget for the implementation of the Euratom Research and Training Programme (2014-2018) is €1 603 329 000.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 23 December 2013.
   Action Plan for Energy Efficiency (2007-12)     Action Plan for Energy Efficiency (2007-12)     The Commission has adopted an Action Plan aimed at achieving a 20 % reduction in energy consumption by 2020. The Action Plan includes measures to improve the energy performance of products, buildings and services, to improve the yield of energy production and distribution, to reduce the impact of transport on energy consumption, to facilitate financing and investments in the sector, to encourage and consolidate rational energy consumption behaviour and to step up international action on energy efficiency.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 19 October 2006 entitled: Action Plan for Energy Efficiency: Realising the Potential [       COM(2006) 545      – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The purpose of this Action Plan is to mobilise the general public, policy-makers and market actors, and to transform the internal energy market in a way that provides EU citizens with the most energy-efficient infrastructure (including buildings), products (including appliances and cars), and energy systems in the world.     The objective of the Action Plan is to control and reduce energy demand and to take targeted action on consumption and supply in order to save 20 % of annual consumption of primary energy by 2020 (compared to the energy consumption forecasts for 2020). This objective corresponds to achieving approximately a 1.5 % saving per year up to 2020.     In order to achieve substantial and sustainable energy savings, energy-efficient techniques, products and services must be developed and consumption habits must be changed so that less energy is used to maintain the same quality of life. The Plan sets out a number of short and medium-term measures to achieve this objective.     The Action Plan runs for a six-year period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2012. The Commission considers this timeframe to be sufficient to adopt and transpose most of the measures it proposes. A mid-term review will be carried out in 2009.      POTENTIAL ENERGY SAVINGS      The Commission considers the biggest energy savings are to be made in the following sectors: residential and commercial buildings (tertiary), with savings potentials estimated at 27 % and 30 % respectively, the manufacturing industry, with the potential for a 25 % reduction, and transport, with the potential for a 26 % reduction in energy consumption.     These sectoral reductions of energy consumption correspond to overall savings estimated at 390 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) each year or €100 billion per year up to 2020. They would also help reduce CO2 emissions by 780 million tonnes per year.     These potential savings come in addition to an estimated 1.8 % (or 470 Mtoe) reduction in annual consumption which would partly stem from other measures already adopted and normal replacements of material.     Achieving the 20 % reduction objective will help reduce the EU's impact on climate change and dependence on fossil fuel imports. The Action Plan will also boost industrial competitiveness, increase exports of new technologies and will have positive benefits in terms of employment. The savings made will, moreover, offset the investments put into innovative technologies.      MEASURES PROPOSED BY THE ACTION PLAN      The Commission included in the Action Plan all measures presenting the best cost-efficiency ratio, i.e. those with the lowest environmental cost over the life cycle, which do not overrun the budget given for investments in the energy sector. Some are priority measures, and should therefore be adopted without delay, whilst others are to be implemented throughout the six-year period set for the Action Plan.      Improving energy performance      Effective action on energy-consuming equipment and appliances requires steps on two fronts: standards for the energy yield of appliances and an appropriate, consumer-focused system to label and evaluate energy performance.     To this end, the Action Plan provides for the adoption of       Eco-Design      minimum standards to improve the energy yield of 14 groups of products (including boilers, televisions and light fittings) and to extend it to other products in the long-term. In addition, the Commission hopes to strengthen the       rules on labelling      , in particular by regularly updating classifications and extending these rules to other equipment.     On the basis of Directive       2006/32/EC      on end-use energy efficiency and energy services, the Commission plans to draft guidelines, a code of conduct and a certification procedure applicable to all sectors.     To substantially reduce heat loss in buildings, the Action Plan plans to extend the scope of the       Energy Performance of Buildings Directive      to cover small buildings, to develop minimum performance standards applicable to new and renovated buildings and to promote so-called "passive" houses.      Improving energy transformation      The energy transformation sector uses around one third of all primary energy, yet the average energy yield for transformation facilities is around 40 %. There is great potential for improving this, which would substantially help to reduce energy loss. Energy distribution and transport are also sources of energy losses where action could potentially be taken.     The Commission will develop minimum binding energy efficiency requirements for electricity generation facilities, heating and cooling for facilities operating with less than 20 megawatts of power, and possibly for more powerful facilities too.     It also plans to develop, in cooperation with industry professionals, guidelines for good practices designed both for existing facilities and for energy suppliers and distributors. The promotion of       cogeneration      will also be stepped up and connections with decentralised generation centres will be encouraged.      Limiting the costs linked to transport      With almost 20 % of total primary energy consumption and the fastest growth in consumption, the transport sector represents both a major environmental risk (greenhouse gas emissions) and one of the main factors of dependency on fossil fuels. To solve these problems, it is vital to take action on car use and on promoting cleaner alternative transport.     The Commission plans to set a binding target to reduce polluting car emissions to achieve the threshold of 120g of CO2/km by 2012. It also intends to address the issue of car components, such as air conditioning and tyres, in particular by issuing a European standard for rolling resistance and by promoting tyre pressure monitoring. Moreover, strengthening the rules on vehicle labelling will help to promote the most energy-efficient vehicles, as will proper awareness-raising campaigns and public authorities purchasing clean vehicles.     Urban transport will be the subject of a Green Paper, aimed at pooling experience to encourage the use of alternatives to car transport, such as public transport, non-motorised transport and teleworking.     Reducing the energy consumption of other forms of transport – rail, air and water-based – will also be studied. Accordingly, the Action Plan includes an initiative to extend the greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme to the air transport sector, to improve air traffic control (       SESAR      ), to implement the third rail package, and to connect ships to the electricity network when in harbour.      Financing, incentives and fares      The Action Plan includes several types of measures to facilitate investments designed to boost energy efficiency.     The Commission also calls on the banking sector to offer financing opportunities tailored to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and enterprises providing energy efficiency solutions (businesses providing energy services). In addition, the private banking sector, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the European Investment Bank (EIB) and other international financial institutions will facilitate the establishment of public-private partnerships.     The Commission also plans to remove, where possible, the national legal barriers to shared savings, third-party financing, energy performance contracting and recourse to businesses providing energy services.     Using the Structural and Cohesion Funds will also help provide support to regions in need, especially in the new Member States, including support for habitats.     Taxation is also a powerful tool for providing incentives. Here the Commission notes that it would draft a Green Paper on indirect taxation, revise the       Energy Tax Directive      , and encourage the       taxation of private cars      according to their pollution levels. It also highlights the potential for using tax credits as incentives for both companies and households.      Changing behaviour      Consumers' purchasing decisions will determine the success of the results. The Commission plans a number of educational measures to raise public awareness of the importance of energy efficiency, including education and training programmes on energy and climate change issues. It also proposes to organise a competition to reward the most energy-efficient school.     In addition, the Commission considers that public authorities should set an example. The Commission itself plans to obtain EMAS certification for all buildings it owns, and then to extend the initiative to all EU institutions.     It also plans to adopt guidelines on tenders and to set up networks for cities to exchange good practices concerning energy efficiency in urban areas.      Adapting and developing international partnerships      The Commission considers that European development and trade policies, agreements, treaties and other international instruments represent other ways to promote the spread and use of high energy yield technologies and techniques at global level.     It will launch an international conference with a view to adopting an international framework agreement on energy efficiency which will involve the EU's main trading partners and key international organisations.      Background      In its       Green Paper on the European Energy Strategy      , the Commission underlines the need to strengthen its energy efficiency policy. In addition, the target for a 20 % reduction in energy consumption set in this Action Plan is part of the measures requested by the European Council in March 2006 to ensure the environmental feasibility of European Energy Policy.     The policies and measures contained in this Action Plan are based on the consultations launched by the 2005       Green Paper      on Energy Efficiency.

summary of   Regulation (EU) No 255/2010 - common rules on air traffic flow management   what is the aim of the regulation   It aims to lay down measures regarding  air traffic flow management  (ATFM) to optimise available capacity in the use of airspace and enhance ATFM processes.   The uniform application of specific rules and procedures within the airspace of the single European sky is critical to achieve the optimum use of available air traffic control capacity, through the efficient management and operation of the ATFM function.   key points   The regulation applies:   within the  airspace of the single European sky  as laid out in Regulation (EC) No  551/2004  on  air traffic management  and affects   all flights intended to operate or operating as general air traffic and in accordance with the  instrument flight rules   *    air traffic management;     to the following  parties  involved in  ATFM processes    aircraft operators   air traffic service units   aeronautical information services   entities involved in airspace management   airport managing bodies   central unit for ATFM   local ATFM units   slot coordinators of  coordinated airports   *  .     The planning, coordination and execution of the ATFM measures undertaken by the above list of parties must be in accordance with the provisions laid out by the  International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)  .   EU countries  must ensure that:   the ATFM function is constantly available to the above list of parties involved in the ATFM processes;   the definition and implementation of ATFM measures complies with national security and defence requirements of individual EU countries.    General obligations of air traffic services (ATS) units    ATS units must coordinate - through the local ATFM unit - with the central unit for ATFM when applying an ATFM measure, to ensure that the selected measure will  optimise  the overall performance of the  European Air Traffic Management network (EATMN)   *  .   ATS units must inform the central unit for ATFM of all events that may affect air traffic control capacity or air traffic demand.   ATS units must also provide the central unit for ATFM with  various information  and  subsequent updates  , including among other things:   availability of airspace and route structures;   air traffic control sector and airport capacities;   route availability;   deviations from flight plans;   airspace availability.     The full list of data must be made available to the above list of parties involved in ATFM processes and provided free of charge to, and by, the central unit for ATFM.    General obligations of operators    Any relevant ATFM measures and changes to filed flight plans must be included in the planned flight operation and the pilot must be notified. When a flight plan is suspended because the ATFM departure slot cannot be met, the operator concerned must arrange for updating or cancelling the flight plan.    Consistency between flight plans and airport slots    EU countries must ensure that, on request by an airport slot coordinator or managing body of a coordinated airport, the central unit for ATFM or the local ATFM unit provides them with the agreed flight plan of a flight operating at that airport, before the flight.    Critical events    EU countries must ensure the creation and publication of ATFM procedures for the management of critical events to  minimise disruption to the EATMN  .   To prepare for critical events, ATS units and airport managing bodies will coordinate the  contingency procedures  with the operators affected by such events.    Monitoring of ATFM compliance    EU countries must ensure that airports  adhere to ATFM departure slots  . Where the adherence is 80% or less during a year, the ATS units at the airport concerned must detail the actions taken to ensure future adherence.   The ATS unit at an airport is also responsible for providing the appropriate information on any  failure to adhere to flight plan rejections or suspensions  at that airport and to detail the actions taken to ensure future compliance.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 26 September 2011.   background   See also:    Single European Sky  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Instrument flight rules:  rules which allow properly equipped aircraft to be flown under instrument meteorological conditions (detailed in ICAO Annex 2: Rules of the Air, Chapter 5: Instrument Flight Rules).   Coordinated airport:  an airport with a high level of congestion where demand exceeds capacity during the relevant period and where, in order to land or take off, it is necessary for an air carrier to have a slot allocated by a coordinator.   European Air Traffic Management network:  the collection of systems enabling air navigation services in the EU to be provided, including the interfaces at the EU's external boundaries.
   Social services of general interest     Social services of general interest     This Communication is a further step towards taking into account the specific nature of social services at European level. It presents an open list of characteristics reflecting the specific nature of social services as services of general interest. It clarifies the conditions for applying Community rules to such services.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 26 April 2006, Implementing the Community Lisbon programme: Social services of general interest in the European Union [       COM(2006) 177      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The Member States are given the freedom to define services of general economic interest and particularly social services of general interest, and to define the obligations and missions relating to such services and their organisational principles. On the other hand, the Community framework requires Member States to take certain rules into account when they determine the arrangements for applying the objectives and principles they have established.     This Communication does not deal with health services. In document       COM(2006) 122      final, the Commission has undertaken to present a specific initiative for this field.     Social services occupy an important place within European society and the European economy.     Social services often contain one or more of the following organisational characteristics:      they operate on the basis of the solidarity principle;       they are comprehensive and personalised, integrating the response to differing needs in order to guarantee fundamental human rights and protect the most vulnerable;       they are not for profit;       they include the participation of voluntary workers;       they are strongly rooted in local cultural traditions. This finds its expression in particular in the proximity between the provider of the service and the beneficiary;       there is an asymmetric relationship between the provider and the beneficiaries of the service that cannot be assimilated to a 'normal' supplier/consumer relationship.      The social service sector, which is in the midst of expansion and experiencing increasing levels of competition, is undergoing a process of modernisation, which may take the following forms:      the introduction of benchmarking methods, quality assurance, and the involvement of users in administration;       the decentralisation of the organisation of these services to the local or regional level;       the outsourcing of public service tasks to the private sector, with the public authorities regulating competition;       the development of public-private partnerships and the use of other forms of funding to complement public funding.       The application of Community rules in the area of social services      The Member States must comply with Community law and the case-law of the Court of Justice when establishing the means of implementing the objectives and principles they have set themselves.     When services of an economic nature are involved, the Member States must ensure that their organisational arrangements are compatible with competition law in particular and also with the rules on the freedom to provide services and freedom of establishment.     The Communication focuses on the most common organisational arrangements:      the partial or complete delegation of a social mission by the public authorities to an external partner or the creation of a public-private partnership;       the granting of public financial compensation to external organisations carrying out a social task of general interest;        regulation of the market.       Analysis of the compatibility with Community law of the organisational arrangements for social services must be carried out on a case-by-case basis.      An in-depth consultation on the specific characteristics of social services      The European Commission intends to consult with all the actors involved, namely the Member States and the providers and users of the services. The consultation will look at:       the factors constituting these characteristics and their relevance to identifying the specific features of social services of general interest;        the ways for the Member States to take these features into consideration when defining tasks of general interest;        the experiences with applying Community law in the field of social services of general interest and the possible problems faced in this context;        how these characteristics could be considered by the Commission when checking compliance with the applicable Community rules.      In order to improve the mutual knowledge of operators and the Commission in matters relating to the application of Community rules and in order to deepen the exchange of information, a monitoring and dialogue procedure in the form of biennial reports will be established.     In early 2006, the Commission launched a study to collect the necessary information to draft the first biennial report. The information will concern the functioning of the sector, its socio-economic importance, as well as the implications of the application of Community law. The results of the study are expected by mid 2007.      Background      This Communication follows the       White Paper on services of general interest      and the       Social Agenda      , which announced a systematic approach to identify and recognise the specific characteristics of social and health services of general interest and to clarify the framework in which they operate and may be modernised. In March 2006, the European Council reiterated the need to maintain the European social model in the complex task of making the internal market for services fully operational.     RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission on the         Social Agenda        [         COM (2005) 33        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      The European Commission proposes a new social policy agenda for the period 2006-2010. The main objective of this new agenda is "a social Europe in the global economy: jobs and opportunities for all".      Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 12 May 2004 entitled "         White Paper on services of general interest        " [         COM(2004) 374        final - Not yet published in the Official Journal].      Presented as an extension of the Green Paper on services of general interest, the Commission White Paper describes the European Union's strategy for promoting the development of high-quality services of general interest. It presents the main elements of a strategy aimed at ensuring that all citizens and enterprises in the Union have access to high-quality and affordable services of general interest.      Commission         Green Paper        of 21 May 2003 on services of general interest [         COM(2003) 270        final - Official Journal C 76 of 25 March 2004].      The Commission, in this Green Paper, undertakes to conduct a complete review of its policies on services of general interest. Its objective is to organise an open debate on the overall role of the Union in the definition of the objectives of general interest pursued by these services and on how they are organised, funded and evaluated. The Green Paper reaffirms the significant contribution of the internal market and competition rules to modernising and improving the quality and effectiveness of many public services, to the benefit of Europe's citizens and businesses. It also deals with globalisation and liberalisation, raising the question of whether a general legislative framework should be established at Community level for services of general interest.

act   Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation) [  COM(2012)11 final  - Not published in the Official Journal].   summary   The European Commission has made legal proposals to strengthen the protection of personal data across the EU. The aim is to replace an existing general law (Directive 95/46/EC) on data protection with a new general law and to replace another law (Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA) with a new law setting out data protection rules where data is used to tackle crime.  Personal data comprises  all information relating to an identified or identifiable person  , either directly or indirectly.  The EU's data protection reform proposals consist of two main laws. One proposed law (a  Regulation  ) is to boost the protection of individuals' personal data and to increase their level of trust in the digital environment.  The other proposed law (a  Directive  ) is to step up the level of protection of individuals' personal data when it is being used to tackle crime. The law also aims to boost trust among law enforcement authorities so that they can exchange personal data in order to tackle crime.   EXAMPLES OF KEY ELEMENTS OF THE REGULATION    Right to have personal data deleted, to move it and to understand how it is handled   The Regulation will improve individuals' ability to control their personal data by, among other things   giving internet users the right to have their personal data deleted e.g. if they withdraw their consent and if there are no other legitimate grounds for retaining the data (the 'right to be forgotten');   the freedom to move their data from one service provider to another without hindrance;   reinforcing the right to information so that individuals better understand how their personal data is handled, particularly when the processing activities concern children.    Helping individuals to exercise their rights   The Regulation will also make it easier for individuals to exercise their rights by   helping national data protection authorities so that they are properly equipped to deal effectively with complaints, with powers to carry out effective investigations, take binding decisions and impose effective and dissuasive sanctions;   making it easier for individuals to take action (e.g. legal action via a court) when data protection rights are violated.    Reducingthe risk of data security breaches   The Regulation will boost data security by:   encouraging the use of technologies which protect the privacy of information by minimising the storage of personal data;   introducing a general obligation for data controllers (those private or public sector organisations who process individuals' data) to notify data breaches without undue delay (within 24 hours where feasible) to both data protection authorities and the individuals concerned.   It will also require that data controllers designate a Data Protection Officer in companies with more than 250 employees and in firms which are involved in processing data where there are risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals. These same organisations will also have to carry out Data Protection Impact Assessments.
   Prospects for the internal gas and electricity market     Prospects for the internal gas and electricity market     New measures must be added to the existing rules of the internal gas and electricity market in order to guarantee its integral operation. An inventory of the market in fact reveals that there is still malfunctioning and that the current rules do not allow it to be corrected effectively.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 10 January 2007 entitled “Prospects for the internal gas and electricity market” [       COM(2006) 841      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The aim of the European Union (EU) is to set up a truly competitive internal market for gas and electricity to offer consumers a real freedom of choice at fair, competitive prices, to stimulate clean energy production and to improve security of supply.     Although the internal energy market is well established, malfunctioning (identified by the       sector inquiry into the gas and electricity markets      ) persists, preventing both consumers and the economy from getting the full benefit of the advantages of opening up the national gas and electricity markets.     As current rules do not allow effective correction of this malfunctioning, new measures must be taken as the final step in achieving integrated operation of the internal energy market in Europe.      Advantages of creating the internal energy market      The opening of national markets in gas and electricity to competition visibly gives consumers the freedom to choose their energy supplier and, therefore, the opportunity to make savings. It also improves the security of supply by encouraging, on the one hand, investment in facilities, so that interruptions to supply can be prevented, and, on the other hand, diversification of transport routes and energy sources. The existence of a truly competitive energy market also contributes to sustainable development, notably by enabling suppliers of electricity from renewable energy sources to enter the market.      Continued malfunctioning      In practice, the EU is still a long way from achieving its objective of a real internal market in which each consumer has the legal right to choose his supplier and exercise this right simply and effectively armed with the facts, and the current rules do not effectively prevent market malfunctioning.     The legal and functional unbundling of system operators vertically connected to suppliers and producers has proven insufficient to guarantee equal access to the networks. The traditional operators thus maintain their dominant position and new companies wishing to enter the market encounter many problems caused by discriminatory access conditions, lack of available network capacity, a lack of transparent data on the network situation and poor investment.     National regulators do not have the powers or independence necessary for succeeding in their mission. Their powers vary considerably from one Member State to the next, hindering cross-border trade and access to consumers in other Member States.      New set of rules for completion of the internal energy market       Provision of non-discriminatory access to the networks through unbundling      Current legal and functional unbundling has proven insufficient in removing the conflict of interests arising from vertical integration. Clearer separation between operation of transmission systems and production or supply activities must be introduced to ensure that operators maintain, operate and develop the networks in the general interest of the network users.     The separation may be based either on complete ownership unbundling, due to transmission system operators being both operators and owners of the system, or on introduction of an independent transmission system operator for maintenance, development and operation of the systems, which remain the property of the vertically integrated companies.     Complete ownership unbundling appears to be the most economically effective way to ensure development of a real internal energy market. Not only does it eliminate the different interests of system operators but also avoids the need for excessively detailed and complex regulations ensuring independence of vertically integrated system operators.      Strengthening of the role of regulators at national and Community level      The regulatory framework and therefore the powers of the regulators must be strengthened to ensure the conditions of transparency, stability and non-discrimination necessary for development of competition and for investment.     Better coordination of national regulators at European level is, in addition, needed to mitigate the market segmentation resulting from the regulatory differences between Member States. In this sense, it is possible either to improve the present approach, with the disadvantage of continuing to rely on voluntary agreements between 27 national regulators often with different interests, or to formalise the role of the European Regulators Group for Electricity and Gas (ERGEG) into a European Network of Independent Regulators (ERGEG +), or lastly to set up a new single body at Community level.      Cooperation of transmission system operators (TSOs)      To enable free circulation of gas and electricity within the EU, it is essential to establish compatible technical rules and regular exchange of information, increase investment in the network and, in particular, in cross-border interconnections, and move towards regional system operators.      Reduction in possibilities for unfair competition      Due to the monopolies held by the traditional operators before liberalisation, the lack of integration and their natural characteristics, in particular low elasticity of demand, the gas and electricity markets are particularly exposed to the risk of dominant positions.     Greater transparency, recourse to the ‘use-it-or-lose-it’ principle, genuine access to gas storage facilities and maintenance of incentives in favour of new storage capacities would facilitate the transition to a more competitive gas and electricity market.      Encouragement of investment in electricity power plants and gas infrastructures      Creating a stable environment for investment is a priority. Other factors may also influence investment, such as the award of emission certificates or specific incentive measures, for example for production of electricity from renewable energy sources.      Consumer protection      Consumer protection and public service obligations must be an integral part of the process of opening up the gas and electricity markets. An energy consumers’ charter must therefore protect their essential rights: the right to relevant information on the different suppliers and supply possibilities, the right to a straightforward procedure for changing supplier, protection against energy poverty for the most vulnerable consumers, protection against unfair commercial practices, etc.      Background      The internal energy market has been put in place gradually, starting with Directive       96/92/EC      laying down rules for the internal market in electricity and Directive       98/30/EC      laying down rules for the internal market in natural gas, which were replaced respectively by Directives       2003/54/EC      and       2003/55/EC      .     The Commission draws conclusions from the review of the internal gas and electricity market drawn up by its sector inquiry, and announces that a third legislative package will be added to the current rules.     RELATED ACTS      Report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament – Progress in creating the internal gas and electricity market [         COM(2008) 192        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      The report presents the progress made on the internal gas and electricity market since the opening of national markets to competition on the 1st July 2007. Among the main advances it highlights regional initiatives which have stimulated cross-border cooperation.     Three years after the deadline of July 2004 for implementation passed, it nevertheless appears that the requirements of the directives on electricity and gas have not been appropriately implemented in certain Member States.     A notable finding of this report is that regulatory oversight, unbundling and regulated supply tarifs, as well as the communication of Public Service Obligations, are not satisfactory.

summary of   Regulation (EU) 2018/643 on rail transport statistics   what is the aim of the regulation   It applies to all railways in the EU.   It establishes common rules for producing EU-wide rail transport statistics.   It  recasts  and repeals Regulation (EC) No  91/2003  which had been substantially amended several times.   key points    EU countries  :   must report statistics for all rail transport on their territory and break these down by country if the service is international;   may exclude from the statistics railways which   operate within industrial zones or harbours   provide local tourist services, such as historical steam trains;     coordinate the data sources used and ensure the quality of the statistics;   send the statistics to  Eurostat, the EU’s statistical office  .   The  statistics required  cover:   quarterly and annual data on goods and passengers carried, including per kilometre;   an annual breakdown by region every 5 years of goods and passengers transported;   traffic flows every 5 years on the number of goods and passenger trains;   detailed classification of the different types of goods, including dangerous items.   The  national information  collected by a public or private body may come from:   compulsory surveys;   administrative or regulatory data;   statistical estimation procedures;   professional rail organisations;    ad hoc  studies.    Eurostat  :   sends out the statistics based on the data it receives;   develops and publishes methodology to help national authorities collect quality data.   The  European Commission  :   presents a report to the  European Parliament  and the  Council  by 31 December 2020 — and then every 4 years — on the legislation’s implementation;   has the renewable 5-year power from 13 December 2016 to use  delegated acts  , in line with  Article 290  of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, to adapt technical definitions in the light of new developments;   is assisted by the  European Statistical System Committee  .   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 22 May 2018. Regulation (EU) 2018/643  revised  and replaced Regulation (EC) No  91/2003  (and its subsequent amendments).   background   The Commission needs rail statistics to monitor and develop the  common transport policy  , including  trans-European networks  , and if necessary, to act to improve rail transport safety.  Common concepts and standards ensure national statistics are comparable and help avoid duplication.
   Common organisation of the fruit and vegetable markets     Common organisation of the fruit and vegetable markets     The common organisation of the fruit and vegetables market was radically changed in a 2007 reform. The reform also combined this sector with that of processed fruit and vegetables.     ACT     Council Regulation (EC) No       2200/96      of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     From 2008, the reform of the common organisation of markets in fruit and vegetables will replace the system under the current Regulation.      Scope      The       products concerned      are: fresh fruit and vegetables and certain types of dried fruit. The exceptions or products not covered by this regime are potatoes, grapes,       bananas      , sweetcorn, peas, fodder beans and       olives      .     The       marketing years      can be set by the Commission based on the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables.      Grading of products      To facilitate trade and increase the profitability of production, products are graded and subject to standards. The product holder is responsible for compliance with the standards. In order to be marketed, products must comply with the standards. The various items of information and in particular the product's origin, variety and grade should be displayed legibly at retail sale. These standards take account of those recommended by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Working Party on Agricultural Quality Standards.     Standards are not enforced before products are packaged or prepared, nor for products that will be processed. The same is true for products sold directly by the grower and for certain named local products. Special measures can also be taken in the event of shortages or exceptional surpluses.     Controls are carried out in order to monitor compliance with standards at all stages of marketing.     Products imported from non-EU countries must comply with these standards or with at least equivalent standards. Similarly, Community products intended for export to non-EU countries have to comply with Community standards.      Producer organisations      From 2008, a new system governs producer organisations and producer organisation associations. However, organisations and associations recognised as such under the current Regulation will retain their status. Where necessary, they will have to adapt to the requirements of this Regulation by 31 December 2010.     Producer organisations are legal entities recognised by the Member States and set up on the initiative of producers. Minimum recognition criteria are set, particularly as regards the number of members and turnover.     There are several categories of organisation, namely: fruit and/or vegetables, citrus fruits, nuts, mushrooms and products intended for processing, as well as other organisations covering several products. These organisations, recognised by the Member States, contribute mainly to facilitating the production and marketing of products, helping producers to develop their production and encouraging the application of agri-environmental measures.     Member producers have to apply the rules adopted by their organisation and sell, save in exceptional cases, all their production through their intermediary. They also contribute financially to the operational fund.     The       operational fund      established by producer organisations is financed in equal parts by the producers and the European Community. In regions where the level of producer organisations is insufficient, the Member States may allocate complementary aid.     Where less than 15% of the production of the Member State is marketed by the producer organisations and where fruit and vegetable production represents 15% of the total agricultural production, this complementary aid can be reimbursed by the Community.     The funds are meant to finance both market withdrawals and operational programmes approved by national authorities or action plans presented by pre-recognised producer organisations. The proportion of the operational fund earmarked for withdrawals is a maximum of 30%. Financial assistance may not exceed 4.1% of the value of the products marketed by the organisation.      Operational programmes      are meant to help producers to improve production and the marketing of products and to encourage the application of agri-environmental measures and phytosanitary standards and rules. The multi-annual operational programmes are accepted or refused by the Member States. A national set of requirements, approved by the European Commission, lays down the criteria for the acceptance of agri-environmental measures.     Following the reform of the common organisation of markets for fruit and vegetables, the operational programmes approved under this Regulation must meet the new conditions which will apply from 2008.     Producer organisations or associations of producer organisations functioning in an economic region, representative of producers and production, can ask the Member State to extend the rules adopted by the organisation or association to other producers established in the region. These producers must, under certain conditions, contribute 50% of the financing for the functioning of the organisation and to measures meant to ensure better marketing of fruit and vegetables.     The other half of the financing is covered by the European Union (EU), which limits this funding to no more than 4.1% of the value of the products marketed by the producer organisation (a change introduced by Regulation (EC) No       2699/2000      ).     This single ceiling of 4.1% signifies a major change to the market-organisation regime, increasing aid for the producer organisation's operational funds. The single ceiling has replaced the previous ceiling, which had been set per producer organisation at 4.5% of the value of the products they market and for all producer organisations a maximum amount of 2.5% of the total combined turnover of the organisations.     The European Commission may ask the Member States not to authorise the extension where it contravenes European competition rules or where provisions concerning the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables are not complied with.      Inter-trade organisations and agreements      The inter-trade organisations are composed of representatives of economic operators active in the fruit and vegetable sector and/or in several regions of the European Community. The objective of the inter-trade organisations, recognised by the Member States under the control of the European Commission, is to promote the production and marketing of fruit and vegetables and to encourage their members to implement environmental measures. Though they may clash with Community provisions on competition, business agreements are sometimes authorised within such organisations.      Intervention arrangements      From time to time, producer organisations may decide not to place some of their products (see Annex II to the Regulation) on the market, provided that the use of the products does not undermine the normal disposal of products or harm the environment. For the quantities they withdraw from the market, they receive Community withdrawal compensation, a single amount valid throughout the Community (see Annex V to Regulation (EC) No       2200/96      ).     The compensation may not cover more than 5% of the marketed quantity for citrus fruit, 8.5% for apples and pears and 10% for the other products in question. Growers who are not members of producer organisations also have access to this intervention mechanism via a producer organisation, but the Community withdrawal compensation they receive is reduced by 10%.      Free distribution and withdrawn products      Withdrawal procedures are supervised by the Member States and the Commission. Unsold withdrawn products can under no circumstances return to the market. They have to be distributed free of charge for social and charity purposes, distilled, used for animal feed or for non-food purposes, or finally destroyed in an environmentally sound manner. The Community will bear the cost of free distribution, including, in this case, sorting and packaging costs.      Reforms to market-organisation regimes to include the new Member States      The regime for fruit and vegetables was also amended by the agriculture chapter of the Act of Accession, in particular as regards Cyprus and Malta. Malta was granted special temporary assistance for producers of fresh fruit and vegetables, scheduled to last for 11 years from the date of accession and declining gradually over that period. Cyprus was granted withdrawal compensation for apples, pears, peaches, table grapes and citrus fruit, to last for five years following the date of accession.      Trade with third countries      This system will be replaced by a new system for trade with third countries as from 2008.     Imports and exports may be subject to the issuing of an       import or export licence      .     The       Common Customs Tariff      rates of duties apply to products in the fruit and vegetable sector.     All       tariff quotas      for fruit and vegetables are allocated on a 'first come, first served' basis, except for the quota for garlic, bound within the WTO, for which a 'traditional/new arrivals' method has been introduced.     Where imports are likely to threaten the stability of the Community market,       safeguard measures      may be introduced with respect to the international obligations of the Community.      Export refunds      may be granted for various fresh fruit and vegetables: apples, lemons, oranges, peaches, nectarines, table grapes, tomatoes and some nuts. Some of the refunds are granted on the basis of an amount and quantity which are set periodically and others are awarded on the basis of requests from operators and the quantities available.     When trading with third countries, it is normally forbidden to impose       charges having equivalent effect to customs duties      or to apply any quantitative import restrictions or measures having the same effect.

summary of   Directive 96/59/EC — disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated terphenyls (PCB/PCTs)   what is the aim of the directive  It harmonises law on the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated terphenyls (PCBs/PCTs)  *  and the decontamination or disposal of equipment containing them.   key points    EU countries must ensure that:   used PCBs and PCTs and equipment containing them are disposed of as soon as possible;   inventories are compiled of equipment containing more than 5 litres of PCBs and PCTs, and summaries of these are sent to the  European Commission  within 3 years of the legislation’s adoption;   companies disposing of PCBs and PCTs are licensed and keep registers of the quantity, origin and nature of the used PCBs and PCTs they receive;   safety precautions are in place to prevent any risk of fire to PCBs and PCTs or equipment containing them;   PCBs or PCTs are not burned on ships;   transformers are not topped up with PCBs or PCTs;   transformers containing more than 0.05 % by weight of PCBs or PCTs are decontaminated according to the conditions specified in the legislation;   equipment containing more than 5 litres of PCBs and PCTs is decontaminated and/or disposed of at the latest by the end of 2010, except for transformers containing between 0.05 % and 0.005 % by weight of PCBs or PCTs, which can be disposed of at the end of their useful lives.     The inventories contain:   name and address of the equipment holder;   location and description of the equipment;   quantity of PCBs or PCTs the equipment contains;   dates and types of treatment or replacement carried out or envisaged;   date of the declaration.     The Commission:   fixes the reference methods to measure the PCB and PCT content of contaminated materials;   sets technical standards for other ways of disposing of PCBs and PCTs;   makes a list available of the production names of electrical equipment, namely capacitors, resistors and inductance coils, containing PCBs and PCTs;   determines, if necessary, less hazardous substitutes for PCBs and PCTs.      Regulation (EC) No. 850/2004  on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) provides the legal framework for POPs. It is also applicable to PCB, which has been classified as a POP.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 16 September 1996. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 16 March 1998.   background   For more information, see:    ‘Polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated terphenyls (PCBs / PCTs)’  on the European Commission's website.   * key terms     Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated terphenyls (PCTs):  a group of man-made compounds that were widely used in the past, mainly in electrical equipment. They were banned at the end of the 1970s in many countries because of environmental concerns.
   Croatia – External relations, Common Foreign and Security Policy     Croatia – External relations, Common Foreign and Security Policy     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or 'screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     REFERENCES     Commission Report [       COM(2010) 660      final - SEC(2010) 1326 – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The situation presented by the       2010 Report      is satisfactory given the high level of alignment achieved by Croatia in the area of external relations and the Common Foreign and Security Policy. However, the country needs to strengthen its administrative capacity concerning development policy and humanitarian aid. It also needs to strengthen arms control and arms-related information.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission’s words)      The Community       acquis      in this field is composed mainly of directly binding legislation which does not require transposition into national law. The EU legislation results from the Union’s multilateral and bilateral agreements in the area of commercial policy and from a number of autonomous preferential trade measures. In the areas of development and humanitarian aid, Member States must comply with the EU’s relevant legislation and international commitments and equip themselves with the necessary capacity to participate in EU policies in these sectors. Candidate countries are invited to bring their policies with respect to third countries and their positions within international organisations gradually into alignment with the policies and positions adopted by the Union and its Member States.     The Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) are based on legal acts, notably legally binding international agreements, and on policy documents. The       acquis      comprises declarations, actions and political agreements. Member States must be capable of conducting political dialogue within the context of the CFSP, aligning with EU declarations, taking part in EU actions and applying the agreed sanctions and restrictive measures. Candidate countries are invited to align gradually with the EU’s declarations and to apply sanctions and restrictive measures where necessary.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      Some progress has been made in the field of external relations. Croatia has reached an advanced level of alignment and is continuing to coordinate and align its positions in international fora. However, Croatia needs to pay attention to fully complying with its international obligations when resorting to safeguards. Further resources need to be allocated to development policy and humanitarian aid.     Croatia has made further progress in the area of foreign, security and defence policy. It has continued to participate in several EU military and civilian missions. Overall, Croatia has reached a high level of alignment. Croatia needs to continue strengthening implementation and enforcement of arms control, including the transparency of arms-related information.

   Ground handling at Community airports     Ground handling at Community airports     SUMMARY OF:      Directive 96/67/EC on access to the groundhandling market at Community airports      WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?     The ground-handling       *      services at European Union (       EU      ) airports where access is being granted include those that enable airlines to carry out air-transport activities (taxi guidance, cleaning, refuelling, baggage services, etc.).     The directive applies to all EU airports open to commercial traffic whose annual traffic is not less than 2 million passenger movements or 50,000 tonnes of cargo.     KEY POINTS     The managing body of an airport       *      , the airport user       *      or the supplier of ground-handling services       *      must, under the supervision of the designated auditor, rigorously separate the accounts of their ground-handling activities from the accounts of their other activities.     In parallel, the EU country:      must set up, for each of the airports concerned, a         committee of representatives        of airport users to represent users’ interests;       may require that suppliers of ground-handling services be established within the EU and may         limit the number of suppliers authorised        to provide categories of ground-handling services such as baggage handling, ramp handling, fuel and oil handling, cargo and mail handling;       may         reduce to two the number of users        able to provide self-handling for ground-handling services such as baggage handling, ramp handling, fuel and oil handling, cargo and mail handling;       may         benefit from exemptions        (limited in time) where at an airport specific constraints of available space or capacity make it impossible to open up the market and/or implement self-handling;       may under certain conditions         reserve for one body the management of the centralised infrastructures        which cannot be divided up or the cost of which does not allow for duplication. In parallel, subject to certain conditions, EU countries may grant exemptions to airports where specific constraints make it impossible to open up the market and/or implement self-handling to the degree provided for in the directive;       may oblige the supplier chosen at an airport to also         operate on islands        that are part of the territory of the EU country;       may subject the activity of suppliers of ground-handling services to the         requirement to obtain a licence        issued by a public authority that is independent of the airport in order to guarantee safety, security, environmental protection and compliance with social legislation;       must take the necessary measures to ensure that suppliers of ground-handling services and airport users wishing to self-handle have         access to airport installations        – where access to these installations is subject to a fee, the fee shall be determined according to relevant, objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria;       may adopt, subject to the other provisions of EU law, the necessary measures to ensure the         protection of workers’ rights        and         respect for the environment        .      FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?     It has applied since 14 November 1996 and had to become law in the EU countries by 25 October 1997.     BACKGROUND     This directive provided for a gradual implementation schedule according to whether self-handling services or third-party handling services were involved. From 1 January 2001, the directive applies to any airport located on the territory of a EU country at which the annual traffic is not less than 2 million passenger movements or 50,000 tonnes of cargo.     For more information, see:       Groundhandling        (         European Commission        )      KEY TERMS      Ground-handling:      covers a wide variety of services required by airlines in order to operate flights. These services include areas such as maintenance, fuel and freight handling. Ground-handling also covers services like passenger check-in, catering, baggage handling and transport within the airport itself.      Managing body of the airport:      the body responsible for administrating and managing airport infrastructures and supervising and coordinating the activities carried out by different operators.      Airport user:      natural or legal person carrying passengers, mail or cargo by air.      Supplier of ground-handling services:      natural or legal person providing third parties with one or more categories of ground-handling services.     MAIN DOCUMENT     Council Directive       96/67/EC      of 15 October 1996 on access to the groundhandling market at Community airports (OJ L 272, 25.10.1996, pp. 36-45)     Successive amendments to Council Directive 96/67/EC have been incorporated in the original text.

summary of   Decision (EU) 2015/1339 on the conclusion, on behalf of the EU of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change   summary    what does this decision do   It gives the EU's formal approval to the agreement reached at the Doha conference in December 2012 to establish a second commitment period of the  Kyoto Protocol  . The second commitment period runs from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2020.   key points    38 parties, including the EU, are involved in the second phase, and committed to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by at least 18 % below 1990 levels in the period from 2013 to 2020.   The EU, the EU countries and Iceland, have committed to jointly achieve a 20 % reduction in their combined greenhouse gas emissions for the period 2013-2020 compared to the level in 1990 or their chosen base year. The target reflects the total greenhouse gas emissions allowed during the period 2013-2020 under the  climate and energy package  .   The 20 % joint commitment is shared between the EU, the EU countries and Iceland.   The measures needed for the EU and EU countries to deliver on the reduction commitment have already been put in place through the 2020 climate and energy package.   from when does the decision apply  The decision entered into force on 7 August 2015. The Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol has not entered into force yet.   background   The Kyoto Protocol was, until the  Paris climate conference  in December 2015, the world's only legally binding agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Adopted in December 1997, it contains pledges by participating industrialised nations to reduce their total emissions of 6 greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride) by an average of 5 % over the first commitment period (2008-2012) compared to 1990 levels.  At the Doha Climate Change Conference in December 2012, Parties to the Kyoto Protocol adopted the Doha Amendment, establishing a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2013-2020). The second phase of the Kyoto Protocol serves as a bridge towards a post-2020 global climate change agreement.  Since Iceland is not an EU country, the terms of joint fulfilment concerning its participation had to be laid down in a separate international agreement (Council Decision (EU)  2015/1340  ).

   A strategy for better ship dismantling practices     A strategy for better ship dismantling practices     The Commission has adopted a Community strategy aimed at making practices for the dismantling of old ships safer for workers and for the environment. Although the European Union has transposed the       Basel Convention      on movements of hazardous waste as well as its amendment concerning the ban on exporting this type of waste to countries which do not belong to the OECD into Community law, the situation is not satisfactory.     Many decommissioned European ships end up on the beaches of South Asia where they are dismantled. The absence of environmental protection and safety measures results in a high rate of accidents, health risks and large-scale pollution affecting vast expanses of the coast. The strategy proposed to improve ship dismantling practices includes action aimed at contributing to the implemention of the main elements of an international convention on the recycling of ships which has just been adopted. It also provides for measures aimed at encouraging voluntary action by the maritime transport sector and better application of current Community legislation on waste shipments.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 19 November 2008 - An EU strategy for better ship dismantling [       COM(2008) 767      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The European Union (EU) strategy gives effect to the       2007 Green Paper      on better ship dismantling practices. This strategy should guarantee that ships with a strong link to the Union (in terms of flag or ownership) are dismantled only in safe and environmentally sound facilities, in line with the Hong Kong Convention developed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and adopted on 19 May 2009.     Such a strategy complies with       Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006      on waste shipments which transposes the Basel Convention. It thus aims to prevent the export of hazardous end-of-life ships from the EU to developing countries, and to protect human health and the environment during dismantling operations, without creating unnecessary new economic burdens.      Main elements of the strategy proposed by the Commission      The EU strategy proposes a series of measures aimed at improving ship dismantling conditions as soon as possible, in particular during the interim period preceding the entry into force of the new IMO convention. The following measures are envisaged in particular:      start preparations to introduce measures on key elements of the new IMO convention, in particular concerning surveys, certification and the inventory of hazardous materials present on board ships;       encourage voluntary industry action through various measures, such as awards for exemplary “green” recycling activities, the publication of guidelines and a list of “clean” dismantling facilities.       provide technical assistance and support to developing countries for training programmes in safety and the establishment of basic infrastructure for environmental and health protection;       improve the application of current rules on waste shipments by intensifying controls in European ports, enhancing cooperation and exchange of information between European authorities and the establishment of a list of ships ready for scrapping.      The strategy also proposes that the Commission should examine the feasibility of the following measures:      establish auditing and certification of ship recycling facilities worldwide and evaluate how EU ships might be encouraged to use this scheme;       ensure that warships and other government vessels which do not come under the scope of the convention be subject to Community rules for their “clean” dismantling;       establish a mandatory international funding system for “clean” ship dismantling.       Context      The preparation of an EU strategy for environmentally sound ship dismantling practices is one of the elements of the Commission action plan on an integrated maritime policy for the European Union.     This Communication has the aim of encouraging debate and paving the way for the legislative proposal to be presented after the adoption of the Hong Kong Convention in May 2009.

   Civil Justice specific programme (2007-2013)     Civil Justice specific programme (2007-2013)     The 'Civil Justice' programme fosters judicial cooperation through support for the training of legal practitioners and by strengthening networks for exchanging and disseminating information. As part of the general 'Fundamental Rights and Justice' programme, it contributes to the creation of a European area of justice in civil matters based on mutual recognition and confidence.     ACT     Decision No       1149/2007/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 September 2007 establishing for the period 2007-2013 the Specific Programme 'Civil Justice' as part of the General Programme 'Fundamental Rights and Justice'.     SUMMARY     The aim of the 'Civil Justice' programme is to maintain and strengthen an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union. It covers the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013.     The programme (which does not apply to Denmark) has four main general objectives:      to foster judicial cooperation in civil matters in order to create a European area of justice based on mutual recognition and confidence;       to eliminate obstacles to the good functioning of cross-border civil proceedings between Member States;       to facilitate access to justice for individuals and businesses;       to promote and strengthen contacts, networks and the sharing of information between judicial and administrative authorities and the legal profession so as to improve mutual knowledge and understanding.       Encourage judicial cooperation in civil matters      This decision fosters better administration of justice by preventing conflicts of jurisdiction, promoting recognition of judgments in civil and commercial matters, ensuring legal certainty, improving access to justice, eliminating obstacles to the good functioning of cross-border litigation and making Member States' legislation more compatible.     The programme further aims to:      improve mutual knowledge of national legal and judicial systems;       promote training in Community law for legal practitioners;       encourage networking, cooperation and exchanges of information and experience;       ensure the sound implementation and assessment of EU actions;       improve information on the legal systems in the Member States and access to justice;       reinforce mutual confidence while respecting the independence of the judiciary;       facilitate the operation of the European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters.       Achieve these objectives through concrete actions      The Community supports actions initiated by the Commission, transnational projects presented by NGOs, international organisations or national partnerships (involving at least two Member States or one Member State and an acceding or candidate country) and the activities of NGOs or other bodies pursuing aims of general European interest, and helps finance the work of the European Network of Councils for the Judiciary (ENCJ) and the Network of the Presidents of the Supreme Judicial Courts of the European Union in pursuing objectives of general European interest.     The 'Civil Justice' programme targets inter alia national authorities, legal practitioners and the citizens of the EU in general. Actions under the programme are open to acceding and candidate countries and the Western Balkan countries included in the stabilisation and association process (in accordance with the conditions laid down in the association agreements or additional protocols relating to participation in Community programmes concluded or to be concluded with those countries). Projects may associate legal practitioners from Denmark or candidate countries or third countries not participating in the programme.     The programme is also open to public and private organisations, including professional associations, universities, research institutes and legal and judicial training institutes, legal practitioners, international organisations and NGOs.     Projects are evaluated and awards made on the basis of: the conformity of the proposed action with the Commission's annual work programme, the quality of the proposed action (design, organisation and expected results), the amount of Community financing applied for and the link between the actions, the objectives and the expected results.      Budgetary resources and protection of the Community's financial interests      The Programme has a budget of EUR 109 300 000 for the period 2007-2013. Community financing can be in the form of operating grants or grants to actions following calls for proposals, or public procurement contracts for accompanying measures (purchase of goods and services).     The Commission applies preventive measures against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities. It carries out checks, recovers amounts wrongly paid, imposes penalties if it detects irregularities, and can, if time limits are not observed, cancel the remaining financial support, demand repayment of sums already paid, and add interest to delayed payments.      Role of the Commission: monitoring and follow-up      The Commission adopts an annual work programme specifying objectives, thematic priorities and accompanying measures. It is assisted, as appropriate, by a management or an advisory committee.     It monitors and evaluates the programme and must submit to the European Parliament and the Council an annual report on the implementation of the programme, an interim evaluation report (not later than 31 March 2011), a communication on the continuation of the programme (not later than 30 August 2012) and an ex-post evaluation report (not later than 31 December 2014).     It ensures that beneficiaries submit technical and financial reports on the progress of work, a final report and supporting documents regarding expenditures, and makes these available to the Member States. It also ensures that payment timetables and financing conditions are adjusted as required, monitors the implementation of the programme, publishes the list of actions financed each year and provides for audits by the Court of Auditors.      Complementarity with other programmes      The Commission seeks to ensure synergies and complementarity with the following programmes:       'Criminal Justice'        .        'Security and Safeguarding Liberties'        .        'Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows'        .       'Community Statistical Programme'. (         pdf        ).

summary of   Council Decision 94/800/EC on the conclusion on behalf of the EU of the agreements reached in the Uruguay Round multilateral negotiations (1986-1994)    Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations (1986-1994) — Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation (WTO) — more specifically the Agreement on Trade-related Aspect of Intellectual Property Rights   what is the aim of the decision and the agreement   The decision approves the agreement which established the  World Trade Organization (WTO)  on behalf of the European Community (today the European Union – EU), that includes the  Agreement on Trade-Related Aspect of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)  .   TRIPS pursues 2 main aims:   it ensures effective and appropriate protection for trade-related intellectual property rights, taking into account differences in national legal systems;   it establishes multilateral minimum rules to help combat counterfeiting.     key points   The basic principles are those of  national treatment  and  most-favoured-nation treatment  . This means members of the WTO must treat the nationals of other member countries no less favourably than their own nationals. In addition, any advantage given to nationals of another member country must also be given immediately and unconditionally to the nationals of all other member countries, even if this is more favourable treatment than it gives to its own nationals.   GENERAL RULES    Standards concerning the availability, scope and use of intellectual property rights    The agreement aims to ensure that adequate rules on the protection of intellectual property are applied in all member countries, on the basis of the basic obligations laid down by the  World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)  in the various conventions on intellectual property rights (the  Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property  , the  Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works  , the  Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations  , and the  Washington Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits  ). Numerous new rules or stricter rules are introduced in fields not covered by the existing conventions or where the existing conventions are inadequate.   With regard to  copyright  , the members of the WTO must comply with the basic rules of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. Computer programs will from now on be protected as literary works.   As regards  rental rights  , authors of computer programs and producers of sound recordings may authorise or prohibit the commercial rental of their works to the public. A similar exclusive right applies to  cinematographic works  .   The agreement specifies the types of signs that may benefit from protection as  trademarks  as well as the minimum rights conferred on their owner. It also lays down the requirements relating to:   the use of trademarks;   the duration of protection;   licensing and the assignment of trademarks.     As far as  geographical indications  are concerned, members of the WTO must prevent the use of any misleading indications regarding the origin of a product and any use which would be unfair competition. The agreement also provided additional protection for geographical indications for wines and spirits, even where there is no risk of consumers being misled.    Industrial designs  are protected under the agreement for 10 years. Their owners have the right to prevent third parties from making, selling or importing articles whose design is a copy of the protected design.   With regard to  patents  , members of the WTO have the general obligation to comply with the 1967 Paris Convention. In addition, the TRIPS Agreement states that it must be possible for all inventions to be protected by a patent for 20 years.   Certain inventions may be excluded from being patented if their use is prohibited for reasons of public order or morality.   Other authorised exclusions include:   diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical methods for the treatment of humans or animals;   plants and animals (other than micro-organisms); and   essentially biological processes for producing plants or animals (other than non-biological and microbiological processes). However, members must provide for the protection of plant varieties either by patents or by a specific one-off system.       WTO members must provide for the protection of  layout designs ofintegrated circuits  in accordance with the Washington Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits. The TRIPS Agreement also sets out a number of other rules, relating in particular to the duration of protection.    Trade secrets and technical knowledge  that have commercial value must be protected against breaches of confidence and any act contrary to honest commercial practices. Furthermore, anti-competitive practices in contractual licences may be subject to measures on the part of members to prevent and/or control such practices.    IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AGREEMENT    Enforcement of intellectual property rights    The laws of the member countries of the WTO must include procedures to ensure that intellectual property rights are respected both by foreign rights-holders and by their own nationals. These procedures must permit effective action against any act of infringement of these rights. They must be fair and equitable, they must not be unnecessarily complicated or costly, and they must not entail unreasonable time limits. Final administrative decisions may be reviewed by a judicial authority.   The agreement provides details concerning evidence, injunctions, damages, provisional measures and other remedies.    Transition period   With regard to the application of the agreement, developed countries had a period of 1 year to bring their legislation and practices into line with the agreement. This period was extended to 5 years for developing countries and countries which were changing from a centrally-planned economy to a market economy, and to 11 years for the  least-developed countries  .   Institutional framework    The agreement created a  Council for Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  (the Council for TRIPS). It is responsible for monitoring the operation of the agreement, ensuring that members comply with their obligations and affording opportunities for consultations between members.   The settlement of disputes over intellectual property is governed by the  dispute settlement procedures  adopted following the  Uruguay Round  negotiations   from when do the decision and the agreement apply   The decision has applied since 22 December 1994.   The agreement has applied since 1 January 1995.   background   For more information, see:  ‘EU and WTO’  (  European Commission  ).   main documents   Council Decision  94/800/EC  of 22 December 1994 concerning the conclusion on behalf of the European Community, with regard to matters within its competence, of the agreements reached in the Uruguay Round multilateral negotiations (1986-1994) (OJ L 336, 23.12.1994, pp. 1–2)   Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations (1986-1994)  — Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO)
act    Article 2 TEU    Article 7 TEU   Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union - Respect for and promotion of the values on which the Union is based (  COM/2003/0606 final  of 15 October 2003).   summary   The EU is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities (  Article 2  of the Treaty on European Union (TEU)).  Only European States which respect the values referred to in Article 2 and are committed to promoting them may apply to become a member of the EU  (Article 49 TEU  ).   Ensuring compliance with the fundamental values of the EU   Within the EU, the rule of law is of particular importance. Respect for the rule of law is a prerequisite for the protection of all the fundamental values listed in Article 2 TEU. It is also a prerequisite for upholding all rights and obligations deriving from the treaties and from international law.   the eu rule of law framework   In March 2014, the European Commission adopted a new framework for addressing systemic threats to the rule of law in any of the EU’s 28 countries. The new rule of law framework is complementary to infringement procedures - when EU law has been breached - and to the so-called ’Article 7 TEU procedure’ which, at its most severe, allows for the suspension of voting rights in case of a ’serious and persistent breach’ of EU values by an EU country.  The framework allows the European Commission to enter into a dialogue with the EU country concerned to prevent the escalation of systemic threats to the rule of law. In preparing its assessment, the Commission can draw on the expertise of other EU institutions and international organisations (notably, the  European Parliament  , the  Council  , the  Fundamental Rights Agency  , the  Council of Europe  , the  Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe  (OSCE), etc.).  If no solution is found within the Framework, Article 7 TEU will always remain the last resort to resolve a crisis and ensure compliance with EU values.   Article 7 TEU   Article 7 TEU aims at ensuring that all EU countries respect the common values of the EU, including the rule of law. The preventive mechanism of Article 7(1) TEU can be activated only in case of a ’clear risk of a serious breach’ and the sanctioning mechanism of Article 7(2) TEU only in case of a ’serious and persistent breach by a Member State’ of the values set out in Article 2.  The  preventive mechanism  allows the Council to give the EU country concerned a warning before a ’serious breach’ has actually materialised.  The  sanctioning mechanism  allows the Council to suspend certain rights deriving from the application of the treaties to the EU country in question, including the voting rights of that country in the Council. In that case the ’serious breach’ must have persisted for some time.   application   Since 2009, the Commission has been confronted on several occasions with crisis events in some EU countries, which revealed specific rule of law problems. The Commission has addressed these events by  exerting political pressure  , as well as by launching  infringement proceedings  in case of violations of EU law.  The preventive and sanctioning mechanisms of Article 7 TEU have so far not been applied.   Initiatives of other EU institutions   All EU institutions have a complementary role to play in promoting and maintaining the rule of law in the EU.  In December 2014, the Council and the EU countries committed themselves to establishing an annual dialogue among all EU countries within the Council to promote and safeguard the rule of law in the framework of the treaties.  The European Parliament has also at several occasions called for EU countries to be regularly assessed on their continued compliance with the fundamental values of the EU and the requirement of democracy and the rule of law.

summary of   Directive (EU) 2019/633 on unfair trading practices in business-to-business relationships in the agricultural and food supply chain   what is the aim of the directive   It sets out a minimum list of  prohibited unfair trading practices  between buyers and suppliers in the agricultural and food supply chain and lays down minimum enforcement rules.   It aims to stop larger businesses exploiting small and medium-sized suppliers because of their weaker bargaining position, and to avoid the costs of such practices being passed on to primary producers.   key points   The rules protect small and medium-sized suppliers, as well as larger suppliers with an annual turnover not exceeding €350 million. The protection depends on the relative size of the supplier and the buyer in terms of annual turnover. These suppliers are divided into 5 sub-categories by turnover:   up to €2 million;   €2-10 million;   €10-50 million;   €50-150 million; and   €150-350 million.    Prohibition of unfair trading practices   The directive prohibits the following  unfair trading practices  in any circumstances:    payment  later than 30 days for perishable agricultural and food products;   payment later than 60 days for other agricultural and food products;   short-notice cancellations of perishable agricultural and food products;   unilateral changes to the terms of the supply agreement by the buyer;   payments requested by the buyer that are not related to the sale of an agricultural and food product;   payments requested by the buyer for the deterioration or loss of agricultural and food products where such deterioration or loss is not caused by the negligence or fault of the supplier;   refusal by the buyer to provide a written confirmation of a supply agreement, despite the supplier’s request;   misuse of the supplier’s trade secrets by the buyer;   commercial retaliation actions by the buyer against the supplier if the supplier exercises their contractual or legal rights;   transferring costs for examining customer complaints to the supplier’s products despite the absence of negligence or fault on the part of the supplier.   The directive prohibits the following  unfair trading practices  unless the supplier and the buyer  have agreed to it  in clear and unambiguous terms:   the buyer returns unsold agricultural and food products to the supplier without paying for those unsold products or without paying for the disposal of those products, or both;   the supplier is charged payment as a condition for stocking, displaying or listing its agricultural and food products, or of making such products available on the market;   the buyer asks the supplier to pay for discounts on agricultural and food products sold by the buyer as part of a promotion;   the buyer asks the supplier to pay for the advertising or marketing by the buyer of agricultural and food products;   the buyer charges the supplier for staff for fitting out premises used for the sale of the supplier’s products.    Complaints and confidentiality   EU countries designate  national enforcement authorities  . Suppliers can complain to the enforcement authority of their own country or the country of the buyer suspected of a prohibited trading practice.  If asked, the enforcement authority must take the necessary measures to protect the identity of the complainant and of any other information considered harmful to the interests of the complainant or suppliers.   Powers of the competent authorities   Enforcement authorities must have the powers and expertise to:   initiate and carry out investigations;   require information from buyers and suppliers;   carry out unannounced on-site inspections;   order that a prohibited practice cease, where appropriate;   impose or initiate proceedings for the imposition of fines and other penalties and interim measures against the business which committed the infringement;   publish decisions.   EU countries may promote effective alternative voluntary dispute resolution mechanisms.  EU countries must ensure that enforcement authorities cooperate effectively with each other and with the Commission and assist each other in cases with a cross-border dimension.  The  European Commission  is assisted by the  Committee for the Common Organisation of the Agricultural Markets  set up under Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 (see summary  The common organisation of agricultural markets in the EU  ).   from when does the directive apply  It has to become law in the EU countries by 1 May 2021. EU countries have to apply the measures by 1 November 2021.   background   See also:    The Directive on unfair trading practices in the agricultural and food supply chain  (  European Commission  ).
   Fewer administrative formalities for more growth     Fewer administrative formalities for more growth     The Commission proposes associating the improvement and simplification of regulations with the achievement of the Lisbon objectives. The Commission draws a link between better regulation and stronger growth, which in turn leads to the provision of more and better jobs. Cutting down on administrative formalities will allow businesses to stimulate growth and create more jobs in the European Union. In order to achieve this objective, the Commission presents tools for better regulation and wishes to strengthen dialogue between the regulatory services of the EU and those of the Member States.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 16 March 2005, entitled "Better Regulation for Growth and Jobs in the European Union" [       COM(2005) 97      - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The aim of this Communication is to stimulate growth and employment by promoting the improvement and simplification of regulations in areas affecting European competitiveness. The Commission considers that this process of regulatory simplification helps to make Europe a more attractive place for investors and workers.     The complexity of Community legislation is counterproductive for the public authorities, businesses, citizens and social partners. The legislative and administrative burdens are particularly onerous for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which account for two thirds of employment in the European Union (EU).      Simplification of existing legislation      Action must be taken at all levels. Cooperation with the Parliament and the Council is therefore essential, as is the Member States' commitment to guaranteeing that the principles of better regulation are respected.     The strategy for regulatory simplification is one of the cornerstones of the Better Regulation initiative. This simplification goes further than simply rewriting the existing legislative texts, requiring efforts to create more effective, more flexible and more proportionate rules for those who must respect and apply them.     With a view to increasing the impact on growth and competitiveness of the legislative simplification initiative, the Commission proposes taking the following measures:       identifying the legislation in need of simplification        in cases where legislative complexity proves to be disproportionate. The Commission proposes using websites on better regulation to let businesses, NGOs and citizens air their views and give specific examples of the administrative costs arising from the legislation to which they are subject;        devising integrated sectoral action plans        to simplify essential technical measures which concern a number of sectors, such as manufacturing industry, the car industry, the fisheries sector or the telecommunications sector;        promoting the use of European standards        as technical back-up for European legislation or as an alternative to legislation.      The Commission drew up an initial simplification programme as early as 2003 with a view to reducing the volume of the Community acquis. It proposed taking a more systematic approach to consolidation and codification once a legislative instrument had been amended and deleting obsolete legislation from the acquis. The Commission calls upon the stakeholders concerned at Community and national level to continue their efforts in this direction.     As regards existing legislation, the Council drew up a list in 2004 of legislative instruments divided into fifteen priority groups for potential simplification. At the start of 2005, following impact analyses on the scope of the simplification process for this list of instruments, an extensive consultation of the Member States and the business community supplemented by an on-line public consultation pushed the Commission to focus primarily on certain key areas, in line with the objectives of competitiveness and economic revival, such as company law, financial services, transport and consumer protection.      Impact assessment      The Commission undertakes to carry out impact assessments with a view to meticulously analysing the economic, social and environmental consequences of the new legislation. These assessments go hand-in-hand with a wide-scale consultation in order to gather the opinions of all stakeholders wishing to contribute to the drafting of the new rules.     In accordance with the new guidelines for impact assessments, emphasis is laid on economic aspects. The main objective is to support competitiveness, including effective competition, while still assessing the social and environmental consequences of the proposed measures. A complex network of various rules at national and regional level will only undermine competition, whereas the application of a single rule in all the Member States is simpler and more effective.      Better regulation at Member State level      Better regulation is not solely a Community concern based on close interinstitutional cooperation: the Member States can also help to reduce bureaucracy. The Commission wants better regulation to become an integral part of the Lisbon National Action Plans. With this aim in mind, it recommends that the Member States:       take national measures        to promote better regulation, which should include impact analysis systems and simplification programmes;        engage in preventive dialogu        e with the Commission services in order to avoid introducing procedures which are not automatically required by a directive at the time of its transposition for harmonised areas reserved for texts deemed to be essential;        use infringement proceedings        and preventive controls to improve the quality of regulations in terms of transparency, legibility and efficiency in non-harmonised areas such as the free movement of goods.      In 2005, the Commission set up advisory monitoring bodies involving:      national experts on the issue of better regulation. This group advises the Commission, particularly as regards simplification and impact analyses. It strengthens cooperation between the Commission and the Member States, thereby improving the quality of the implementation of Community legislation;       independent experts on better regulation, who can intervene at the request of the Commission. These experts are responsible for giving an external opinion on the scientific rigour of the methodology used for specific impact analyses.      The Commission will continue to publish assessment reports with a view to monitoring the implementation of the simplification strategy.     RELATED ACTS      First progress report on the strategy for the simplification of the regulatory environment, 14 November 2006 [         COM(2006) 690        - Not published in the Official Journal].      This Commission working document complements the Communication on the Strategic Review of Better Regulation in the European Union. The Commission takes stock of the progress achieved in the implementation of the simplification strategy. It adds 43 initiatives to those identified in October 2005 with a view to enhancing the simplification process in the period 2006-2009. These new initiatives range from administrative simplification in agriculture and the revision of the eco-label award scheme to the simplification of existing legislation on toys.      Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 14 November 2005, entitled "A strategic review of Better Regulation in the European Union" [         COM(2006) 689        - Not published in the Official Journal].      This strategic review analyses the progress achieved and maps out the main challenges ahead. The Commission considers that great effort has gone into achieving better regulation in the EU, but that the programme must continue to be followed with determination. The Commission, the Parliament, the Council and the Member States can do even more. The Commission insists on the need to further simplify the legislation in force, reduce administrative burdens and codify and repeal obsolete legislation. As regards cooperation with the Member States, the most visible progress can be observed in the measurement of administrative costs and the reduction of burdens. Although only relatively few countries systematically use integrated impact assessments for all new legislative proposals, and the results often cannot be subjected to an external audit, many ad hoc initiatives are taken at national level to lighten the administrative burden, such as on-line administration, one-stop shops and national registration offices.      Communication from the Commission of 21 October 2005 on an EU common methodology for assessing administrative costs imposed by legislation [         COM(2005) 518        - Not published in the Official Journal].      This Communication outlines an EU common methodology and proposes the next steps for its introduction. The EU common methodology for assessing administrative costs must be applied in a proportionate manner, in other words only when the scale of the administrative obligations imposed by an EU act justifies it. However, some efforts to minimise the administrative burden have not involved quantification. In those cases, complaints and suggestions from targeted groups are gathered through public consultation. A group of experts then examines the regulatory framework and makes recommendations for simplification. The Commission considers that an EU common methodology provides net added value, provided that it is not applied at the expense of analysis of other impacts.      Communication from the Commission of 27 September 2005, entitled "Outcome of the screening of legislative proposals pending before the Legislator" [         COM(2005) 462        - Not published in the Official Journal].      This Communication relates to the screening by the Commission of all proposals pending before the Council and the Parliament. One of the factors contributing to the success of the simplification objectives is interinstitutional cooperation. These impact assessments, defined in the Communication of March 2005, relate to pending proposals. When the screening process was launched in April 2005, the total number of pending proposals was 489. The Commission provides for two types of action: the withdrawal of proposals and the continuation of the legislative process with an in-depth economic analysis. Following screening by the Commission, action will be taken as regards the 73 pending proposals which were considered not to be consistent with the Lisbon objectives.     Last updated: 28.02.2007  
summary   Many of the systems and services that are today essential for Europeans' well-being and security depend directly or indirectly on space. They rely on space technologies when using their mobile phones, making financial transactions, taking a plane, watching the weather forecast or looking for the nearest restaurant using car navigation system. Space has become part of their daily lives. The Commission therefore proposes  a new space policy  to meet the challenges of today's world.  Europe's space industry is a driver for growth and innovation and a highly strategic sector, helping citizens face both societal challenges and create innovative technologies and services.   Commercial and innovation challenges:    Across the world, the space industry is highly subsidized through institutional programmes which translate into financing of research and development (R&D) programmes and purchasing of space products and services. Total European R&D is roughly estimated to account for 10% of unconsolidated sales turnover of the EU space sector. In an international context, the funding of European R&D is relatively small. The European institutional market is relatively small - in 2009, the US budget was almost 10 times higher than the European budget - and very fragmented, due to the diversity of public stakeholders and their different and not always coordinated industrial policies.   The satellite communications (SatCom) industry is instrumental in sustaining the entire European space industry. This segment's sales account for more than 60% of the European space manufacturing industry over the last ten years. Although Europe can count on a world-class SatCom industry, this sector faces not only increasing global competition but also technical and political challenges due to the scarcity of the radio spectrum.   Europe needs to position itself in the emerging markets for navigation (SatNav) and Earth observation applications (SatEO), services and products. These service industries have a high potential for growth and job creation. However, the development of the European satellite-based services industry is currently challenged by the existing regulatory framework and insufficient support to start-up companies which are at the heart of services and applications development.   To address these challenges, Europe should achieve  technological non-dependence, security of supply  and maintain  independent access to space  .  The new space communication identifies the main challenges the European space industry faces and proposes a series of measures to help it become more competitive at global level.  A  press release  summarises the key points of the communication.

act   Directive  2014/33/EU  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to lifts and safety components for lifts   summary   European Union (EU) law on the sale and putting into service of lifts and safety components for lifts has two key aims: i) to allow lifts and their safety components to be sold throughout the EU market; and ii) to ensure a high level of safety for lift users and maintenance staff.   what does this directive do  The directive lays down uniform rules on the sale and putting into service of lifts and safety components for lifts. It applies to lifts that permanently serve buildings and constructions and that are intended for the transport of persons and goods. It does not apply to funicular railways, hoists and escalators or walkways.   key points   The directive defines the responsibilities of manufacturers, importers and distributors in the context of the sale of lifts and safety components for lifts:   all lifts and safety components on sale in the EU must bear the  CE conformity marking  to show that they meet all the essential safety requirements of EU legislation;   before obtaining the CE marking, the manufacturer must conduct a safety and conformity assessment and establish technical documentation for its lifts and components;   importers must check whether manufacturers have carried out conformity assessments correctly and inform the authority monitoring the safety if they consider that the lifts or components do not conform with the essential safety requirements;   all necessary documentation must be recorded and kept for 10 years;   documentation and safety information must be written in a language easily understood by end -users;   manufacturers and importers must indicate their postal address on their safety components and lifts;   manufacturers may use electronic means to demonstrate conformity.   In addition, the directive specifies how national authorities who monitor safety must identify and prevent the import of dangerous safety components or lifts from non-EU countries.   when does the directive apply  This directive applies from 18 April 2014. It repeals  Directive 95/16/EC  with effect from 20 April 2016.   background   The directive updates EU rules for the sale of lifts and safety components for lifts. This is part of the effort to modernise European law in a wide variety of industrial sectors, which aims to simplify the rules, reduce administrative burdens and establish clearer and more consistent rules.

summary of   Regulation (EU) No 995/2010 on the obligations of operators who place timber and timber products on the market   what is the aim of the regulation  It prohibits illegally harvested timber from being placed on the EU market, and sets out preconditions for the marketing of timber and timber products in the EU.   key points    The regulation requires ‘operators’ who place timber products on the EU market for the first time to exercise ‘due diligence’  *  to ensure they supply products made of legally harvested timber. To this end, operators must use a due diligence system.   Operators may set up their own due diligence systems or use one created by a monitoring organisation.   Monitoring organisations are recognised as such by the European Commission. Their role is to assist operators comply with the requirements of the regulation.   To facilitate the traceability of timber products, all traders who buy and sell timber on the market must keep records of their suppliers and customers.   The regulation, which applies both to EU-harvested and imported timber, covers a wide range of timber products that are listed in the annex and are in accordance with the  Union Customs Code  .   The regulation considers timber/timber products to be legally harvested if they have a  Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade  (FLEGT) licence (established with Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005), or a  CITES  permit (Regulation (EC) No 338/97).    Monitoring of implementation and access to information   At the latest by 30 April of each year, countries covered by the regulation must make available to the public and the  European Commission  information on the application of this regulation during the previous calendar year. The Commission will also make available to the public a EU-wide overview on the basis of the data submitted by all EU countries.  By 3 December 2021 and every 5 years thereafter, the Commission must review the functioning and effectiveness of this regulation on the basis of the information received each year and the experience with its application.   background   Illegal logging  *  is a pervasive environmental, economic and social problem that contributes to climate change, the loss of biodiversity, lost revenue, conflicts (sometimes armed) over land and resources, and corruption.  For more information, see:    Illegal logging  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Due diligence:  a  risk management exercise  to minimise the risk of illegally harvested timber (or products containing it) being offered for sale on the EU market.   Illegal logging:  the harvesting of timber in violation of the laws of the country of harvest.
   Cotton     Cotton     Extensive changes have been made to the aid arrangements for cotton, with part of the Community support paid to ginners (65%) being converted into a single farm payment. In order to safeguard production in certain areas, area aid will continue to make up 35% of total aid. The new arrangements will apply from 1 January 2006. Cotton is not covered by any of the common market organisations (CMOs).     ACT     Council Regulation (EC) No       864/2004      of 29 April 2004 amending Regulation (EC) No       1782/2003      establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers, and adapting it by reason of the accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia to the European Union.     SUMMARY      Decoupling      Extensive changes have been made to the aid arrangements for cotton, with a partial move to a system of single farm payments. The move is only partial in that 35% of aid will continue to be provided in the form of an area payment (direct aid), with the remaining 65% being provided as a single farm payment.     There has been only a partial move to the new aid arrangements so as to protect certain areas in which production would cease if the new arrangements were fully applied.     Under the previous arrangements, growers did not benefit from direct aid for cotton but rather from indirect aid paid to ginners. The total aid available per hectare in each Member State is fixed at 35% of the national allocation that producers received indirectly.      Direct aid      As in the case of other direct aid to producers, farmers must fulfil certain obligations:       cross-compliance, modulation and financial discipline      .      National base area           Maximum area (total)440 000 ha              Greece             Spain             Portugal             National base area             370 000 ha             70 000 ha             360 ha             Aid in euros per eligible hectare             300 000 ha > 594/ha70 000 ha > 342.85/ha             1 039/ha             556/ha          Additional support: restructuring      Reforming this sector requires financial assistance of EUR 22 million for adjustments. This expenditure will be entered in the 2007 budget.     This assistance, for restructuring programmes in production regions, will be financed by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), Guarantee Section as part of rural development policy.      Background      The reform of agricultural aid for cotton,       tobacco      ,       hops      and       olive oil and table olives      was negotiated together and included in the same Regulation in what was know as the "Mediterranean package".     All these products were subsequently included (April 2004) in the comprehensive reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP) of June 2003, with the approval of the move from direct aid (aid paid by hectare, unit of output or livestock unit) to a       system of single farm payments      .     Cotton,       tobacco      , yeast, olive oil and table oils are grown in certain regions whose development is lagging behind. The reform aims to safeguard production in those regions by according priority to farmers' incomes rather than to providing aid for production. Coupled aid is to be provided for tobacco and cotton to permit adjustment to the new arrangements. Coupled aid may be paid for hops to take account of particular market situations or structural situations within a region.     The current reform affecting "Mediterranean products" is based on the Commission communication to the Council and to the European Parliament "Accomplishing a sustainable agricultural model for Europe through the reformed CAP - the       tobacco, olive oil, cotton and sugar sectors      ".     The current forms of aid for cotton will be abolished from 1 January 2006.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007 on public passenger transport services by rail and by road   what is the aim of the regulation   Known as the  public service obligation (PSO) regulation  , it sets out conditions under which transport operators can be  compensated  or given  exclusive rights  by public authorities to provide public transport services which are in the general interest but would otherwise not be commercially viable. By establishing public service obligations, authorities aim to ensure that passengers can access safe, efficient, attractive and high-quality public passenger transport services.   It repeals Council Regulations (EEC) No  1191/69  and (EEC) No  1107/70  . It was last modified by Regulation (EU)  2016/2338  .   key points   The PSO regulation sets out:   an  obligation  for authorities to conclude  public service  contracts when they   give  exclusive rights  which entitle a public transport operator to provide certain public passenger transport services on a particular route or network or in a particular area, excluding all other operators and/or   give  compensation  to public transport operators to cover the costs incurred in providing public service obligations;      rules  on how public service contracts must be awarded;    rules  on how to calculate the amount of compensation.    Scope   The regulation applies to public passenger transport services by bus and by rail. However, EU countries can also apply it to public passenger transport by  inland waterways  and  national sea waters  .   Public service contracts and general rules    The authority which is competent for a given area must conclude a public service contract granting an operator an  exclusive right  and/or  compensation  in exchange for providing PSOs.   Obligations to apply  maximum tariffs  for all or certain categories of passengers may also be imposed via general rules, which apply to all operators without discrimination.   The authority grants compensation to offset the impact of the public service obligations on the operator’s costs and revenues.   The public service contracts (and general rules) define:   the public service obligations to be discharged;   the rules for calculating compensation and the nature and the scope of any exclusive rights;   overcompensation must be avoided;   how the costs linked to service supply (staff costs, energy, infrastructure, rolling stock, maintenance, etc.) should be allocated;   how revenue from the sale of tickets is to be allocated (whether it is kept by the operator, repaid to the authority, or shared).     The  duration of public service contracts  must  not exceed 10 years for bus and coach services  , and  15 years for rail or other track-based forms of transport  .    Awarding public service contracts    Public service contracts must be awarded according to the rules of this regulation. However, for awarding certain passenger transport services by  bus or tram  , the  public procurement  procedures of Directives 2014/25/EC (see summary  Public purchasing — rules for water, energy, transport and postal sectors  ) and 2014/24/EC apply (see summary  Public contracts — setting out clear ground rules  ).   As a general rule, competent authorities must award public service contracts by  transparent and non-discriminatory competitive procedures  .   However, the obligation to award contracts by a competitive procedure does not apply:   where a local authority provides public transport services itself or assigns them to an  internal transport operator  (a separate body, which the local authority controls in a similar way to one of its own departments);   where the  volume of the contract is modest    estimated average annual value of less than €1 million or   less than 300,000 kilometres of public passenger transport services;     where  emergency measures  are taken or contracts are imposed in response to actual or potential service interruptions.      Public service contracts in the rail sector   Regulation (EU) 2016/2338 has amended this regulation by introducing the principle of competitive award also for public service contracts in the railway sector, which was previously excluded. Long transition periods were allowed, to enable authorities and operators to adapt to the new rules.  Direct award of rail contracts remains possible in exceptional and well-defined circumstances, notably where:   it is justified by  structural and geographical characteristics  of the market and network (size, demand characteristics, network complexity, technical and geographical isolation, type of services); and   it would result in an  improvement in quality of services or cost-efficiency  , or both, compared to the previous contract;   the  volume of the contract is modest    estimated average annual value less than € 7.5 million per year or   fewer than 500,000 kilometres.      Transition period   Unconditional, direct awards of rail public service contracts will no longer be possible as of 25 December 2023.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 3 December 2009, except for Article 5 on awarding of public service contracts, which applies from 3 December 2019.   background   For more information, see:    Public service obligations and competition rules  (  European Commission  )    Land transport  (  European Commission  )    EU competition policy in the transport sector  (  European Commission  ).
   Security Research     Security Research     Recent events have placed security at the forefront of political concerns in Europe and throughout the world. Political, social and technological changes have created a fluid security environment, where the risks and vulnerabilities are more diverse and less visible. The new threats which have appeared ignore state borders and target European interests both within and outside the territory of the European Union (EU). The recent terrorist attacks in Europe underline the need to improve security for people throughout Europe. Technology plays a key role in addressing the new security challenges in this field.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - Security Research: The Next Steps [       COM(2004) 590      final - not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     A coherent security research programme at EU level can add significant value to the optimal use of a highly competent industry. Such research should be targeted at the development of interoperable systems, products and services useful for the protection of European citizens, territory and critical infrastructures as well as for peacekeeping activities.     The high-level Group of Personalities set up to advise on a long-term strategy for security research in the EU has given rise to a report which contains the following recommendations:      the establishment of a European Security Research Programme (ESRP), focusing in particular on issues of internal security from 2007 onwards, with funding of at least EUR 1 billion per year. This programme should aim to boost the competitiveness of the European security industries and stimulate the development of the (public and private) market for security products and systems;       the creation of a European Security Research Advisory Board to define strategic lines of action. The Board should consist of high-level experts representing public and private customers, the industry, research organizations and any other relevant stakeholders;       the need for cooperation between European institutions as well as all other stakeholders involved.       THE NEXT STEPS      This Communication sets out the next steps to be taken in terms of security research, namely:      Developing a European security research programme under the EU's 7th Research Framework Programme (2007-2010)      The Commission will initiate an inter-institutional debate for consensus on the ESRP building on the work of the Preparatory Action on security research, which will continue until the end of 2006. This programme should complement both Community programmes and security and defence research activities conducted at national or intergovernmental level.      Consultation and cooperation with stakeholders      The Commission will establish a European Security Research Advisory Board to advise on the content of the ESRP and its implementation. The Commission will ensure the ESRP is coordinated effectively with international organisations such as the United Nations (UN), the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and NATO, and with European organisations such as the European Space Agency (ESA).      Creating an effective institutional framework      The Commission will ensure that the requirements of the European Security Strategy, the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) are fully taken into account in the development of security research. At the same time it will develop cooperation with the European Defence Agency (EDA) and other important Commission policies relating to internal security will be fully taken into account when developing security research.      Awarding contracts and funding relating to security research      The Commission must put in place effective and flexible mechanisms governing contracts, participation and funding, for example to allow co-funding of new technologies by public authorities so as to ensure a high degree of synergy.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 2533/98 – collection of statistical information by the European Central Bank   summary   The  European Central Bank  (ECB) collects a comprehensive range of data on economic and monetary developments in the European Union (EU). It is assisted in this task by the national central banks of the EU countries.   what does the regulation do  It empowers the ECB to collect statistical information that is necessary to carry out the tasks of the  European System of Central Banks  (ESCB). The ECB’s right to collect statistical information is limited to the reference reporting population*.  It sets out the ECB’s powers to define the statistical reporting requirements of the reference reporting population.  In 2015, the regulation was amended to enable the transmission of confidential statistical information between the ESCB and other authorities of the EU or its countries which are responsible for the supervision of financial institutions, markets, infrastructures or the stability of the financial system. In addition, the ESCB may transmit confidential statistical information to the  European Stability Mechanism  . However, any transmission of data under the 2015 amendment is limited to what is necessary for the receiving authority or body to perform its tasks.   key points   The ECB seeks to minimise the reporting burden by using existing resources as much as possible. It also takes into account the relevant EU and international statistical standards.  The ECB works closely with the  European statistical system  (ESS), which comprises the statistical office of the EU (  Eurostat  ) and the national statistical institutes of the EU countries.   Principles   When developing, producing and disseminating statistics, the ESCB is governed by the principles of:   impartiality (neutral and equally accessible to all users);   objectivity (systematic, reliable and unbiased);   professional independence (no political interference);   cost-effectiveness;   statistical confidentiality (respect for confidential information that relates to single statistical units);   minimisation of the reporting burden; and   high output quality.    EU countries’ obligations   EU countries are responsible for organising themselves in the field of statistics in order to cooperate with the ESCB.   Types of information collected   Data collected cover, in particular:   monetary and financial statistics;   banknote statistics (e.g. stocks and flows of notes in circulation);   payments and payment systems statistics;   financial stability statistics;   balance of payments statistics (i.e. the euro’s share as a settlement/invoicing currency in international trade);   international investment position statistics.    Right of verification   If a reporting agent* in a eurozone country is suspected of infringing its reporting requirements, the ECB and the national central bank can verify the accuracy of the statistical information or carry out its compulsory collection.  The ECB or the national central bank of the country concerned must notify the reporting agent of its decision to check the statistics that they provide or to carry out its compulsory collection. If an agent opposes the verification process, the country in which they are located must give the necessary assistance, including ensuring access to the premises by the ECB or the national central bank. These provisions only apply to eurozone countries.   Sanctions   Reporting agents who fail to comply with their statistical reporting requirements may be subject to fines imposed by the ECB. Penalties range from a daily payment not exceeding €10 000 up to fines of €200 000. The ECB is required to act in accordance with the principles and procedures set out in Regulation (EC) No 2532/98 on the  powers of the ECB to impose sanctions  .   Confidentiality   Statistical information is considered confidential when it is sufficiently granular for reporting agents and any other legal or natural persons or bodies to be identified, either directly (e.g. from their name, address or officially allocated identification code) or indirectly by way of inference.  Reporting agents must be informed of the statistical and administrative uses to which data provided by them may be put. Where relevant, they can obtain information on the legal basis for transmission and on the adopted protection measures.  The ESCB must use confidential statistical information exclusively for carrying out its tasks except:   where the reporting agent, or the other person or body which can be identified, has explicitly given their consent to the use of the confidential statistical information for other purposes;   for the transmission of confidential statistical information to other ESS members;   when granting scientific research bodies access to confidential statistical information which does not allow direct identification (this access must be with the prior explicit consent of the authority which provided the information);   as regards the ECB and the national central banks, where the confidential statistical information is used in the field of  prudential supervision  ;   as regards the national central banks, for the exercise of functions other than those specified in the  protocol on the statute of the ESCB and of the ECB  .   The ECB, the national central banks and EU countries must take all the necessary measures to ensure the protection of confidential statistical information.   key terms    * Reference reporting population:  this mainly comprises central banks, other financial institutions in EU countries (except insurance companies and pension funds), post office giro institutions* and legal and natural persons residing in a eurozone country and who have carried out cross-border transactions or issued securities* or electronic money*. All of these may be reporting agents under the ECB’s statistical reporting requirements.   * Reporting agents:  under the ECB’s reporting requirements, any or all of this reference reporting population can be reporting agents (i.e. they are required to report) depending on the circumstances.   * Post office giro institutions:  these belong to the ‘non-financial corporations’ sector and, in addition to providing postal services, receive deposits from non-monetary financial institutions euro area residents with a view to providing money transfer services for their depositors.   * Securities:  financial instruments, such as companies’ shares and government bonds, usually issued to raise funds for the issuer.   * Electronic money:  money that is in the banking system but does not exist in a physical form. Only a fraction of the total money supply consists of notes and coins.   act   Council Regulation (EC) No  2533/98  of 23 November 1998 concerning the collection of statistical information by the European Central Bank (OJ L 318 of 27.11.1998, pp. 8-19)
   The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia – Taxation     The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia – Taxation     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report – [       COM(2011) 666      final – SEC(2011) 1203 – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia received the status of candidate country for accession to the European Union (EU) in 2005. The Accession Partnership, adopted by the Council in 2008, supports the country’s preparations for its future accession and the aligning of its legislation with the Community       acquis      . In 2008, negotiations for accession had not yet started since some progress still needed to be made with regard to the objectives and conditions defined within the framework of the Partnership.     The       2011 Report      notes improvements concerning the operational capacities of the tax authority. However, improvements to combat tax fraud are required.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission's words)      The       acquis      on taxation essentially covers the area of       indirect taxation      , which comprises VAT (value-added tax) and excise duties. It lays down scope, definitions and principles for VAT. Excise duties on energy products, tobacco products and alcoholic beverages are regulated by EU legislation. With regard to       direct taxation      , the       acquis      covers some aspects of the taxation of individuals’ savings and corporate taxes. Furthermore, Member States are required to comply with the principles of the code of conduct relating to       corporate taxes      , which seeks to abolish harmful tax measures. Administrative cooperation and mutual assistance between Member States aims at ensuring the smooth running of the internal market in the field of taxation and provides instruments for preventing intra-Community       fraud and tax evasion      . Member States must ensure that they have the necessary implementation capacities, specifically connectivity with the EU’s IT taxation systems.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      Limited progress can be reported in the field of harmonisation of       taxation legislation      with the       acquis      . Operational capacity for the administration of taxes continued to improve. Effective means to combat tax fraud have yet to be introduced and a code of conduct for business taxation is not yet in place.     RELATED ACTS      Commission Report [         COM(2010) 660        final –SEC(2010) 1327 – Not published in the Official Journal].      In its       2010 Report      , the Commission regrets the low level of harmonisation made with regard to direct and indirect taxation. However, the operational capacities of the tax authority have been strengthened.

   State aid for public service broadcasting     State aid for public service broadcasting     1) OBJECTIVE     To lay down the criteria for applying the competition rules to public service broadcasting.     2) ACT     Commission communication on the application of state aid rules to public service broadcasting (Text with EEA relevance) [Official Journal C 320 of 15.11.2001].     3) SUMMARY      Background      Since its inception, television broadcasting has been provided mostly by public undertakings under a monopoly regime, mainly as a consequence of the limited availability of broadcasting frequencies and the high barriers to entry. In the 1970s, however, economic and technological developments made it increasingly possible for Member States to allow other operators to broadcast. Whilst opening the market to competition, Member States considered that public service broadcasting ought to be maintained as a way to ensure the coverage of a number of areas and the satisfaction of needs that private operators would not necessarily fulfil to the optimal extent.     This increased competition, together with the presence of state-funded operators, has led to growing concerns about a level playing field, which had been brought to the Commission's attention by private operators. The vast majority of the complaints allege infringements of       Article 87      of the EC Treaty in relation to the public funding schemes established in favour of public service broadcasters.     The EC Treaty includes Articles 87 and 88 on state aid and Article 86(2) on the application of the rules of the Treaty and the competition rules in particular to services of general economic interest. The Maastricht Treaty had already introduced an article which defines the role of the Community in the field of culture (       Article 151      ) and a possible compatibility clause for state aid aimed at promoting culture (Article 87(3)(d)).     At the level of secondary legislation, the present communication is to be seen in the context of the "       Television without frontiers      " Directive, which aims to coordinate certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities, and in the context of Directive       80/723/EEC      on the transparency of financial relations between Member States and public undertakings as well as on financial transparency within certain undertakings.      Applicability of Article 87(1) of the Treaty      State financing of public service broadcasters is normally to be regarded as state aid. However, the existence of state aid will have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis and depends also on the specific nature of the funding. The funding schemes currently in place in most of the Member States were introduced a long time ago. As a first step, therefore, the Commission must determine whether these schemes may be regarded as "existing aid" within the meaning of Article 88(1).      Assessment of the compatibility of state aid under Article 87(2) and (3) of the Treaty      State aid to public broadcasters must be examined by the Commission in order to determine whether or not it can be found compatible with the common market. The derogations listed in Article 87(2) and (3) can be applied, where appropriate. In accordance with Article 151 of the Treaty, the Community is to take cultural aspects into account in its action under other provisions of the Treaty, in particular in order to respect and to promote the diversity of its cultures.      Assessment of the compatibility of state aid under Article 86(2) of the Treaty      The role of       services of general economic interest      in attaining the fundamental objectives of the European Union has been fully acknowledged by the Commission in its communication on services of general economic interest. For Article 86(2) to apply, it is necessary to establish an official definition of the public service mandate. This definition falls within the competence of the Member States, which must take account of the Community concept of "services of general economic interest", as defined by the communication. As regards the definition of the public service in the broadcasting sector, the role of the Commission is limited to checking for manifest error.     Given the specific nature of the broadcasting sector, a "wide" definition of services of general economic interest is acceptable. Such a definition may result in a given broadcaster being entrusted with the task of providing balanced and varied programming while fulfilling the democratic, social and cultural needs of a particular society and guaranteeing pluralism, including cultural and linguistic diversity.     The Commission's task is to verify whether or not Member States respect the Treaty provisions. In order to benefit from the exemption under Article 86(2), the public service remit should be entrusted to one or more undertakings by means of an official act.     While Member States are free to choose the means of financing public service broadcasting, the Commission has to verify that the derogation from the normal application of the competition rules for the performance of the service of general economic interest does not affect competition in the common market in a disproportionate manner. The test is of a "negative" nature: if examines whether the measure adopted is not disproportionate. The aid should not affect the development of trade to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Community.     The above-described assessment by the Commission requires a clear and precise definition of the public service remit and a clear and appropriate separation between public service activities and non-public service activities. Separation of accounts between these two spheres is normally already required at national level to ensure transparency and accountability when using public funds. The transparency requirements in the financial relations between public authorities and public undertakings and within undertakings granted special or exclusive rights or entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest are indicated in Directive       80/723/EEC      .     While state funding is normally necessary for the undertaking to carry out its public service tasks, the state aid must not exceed the net costs of the public service mission, taking into account other direct or indirect revenues derived from the public service mission. For this reason, the net benefit that commercial activities derive from the public service activity will be taken into account in assessing the proportionality of the aid. Accordingly, the Commission will consider whether or not any distortion of competition arising from the aid can be justified in terms of the need to perform the public service as defined by the Member State and to provide for its funding. In its assessment, it will take into account the fact that, to the extent that state aid is necessary to carry out the public service obligation, the system as a whole might also have the positive effect of maintaining an alternative source of supply in some       relevant markets      .      4) implementing measures       5) follow-up work      Last updated: 03.09.2003  
   The prevention of and fight against organised crime in the financial sector     The prevention of and fight against organised crime in the financial sector     This Communication aims to identify those areas where new initiatives may be needed to strengthen the fight against organised financial crime. This covers a range of illegal activities, including money laundering, financial fraud and counterfeiting of the Euro when committed by criminal organisations. Organised financial crime undermines legitimate economic actors and strengthens the shadow economy, thus diminishing economic growth and public resources. The fight against organised financial crime is important since reducing such crime has a broader impact on the fight against organised crime generally. Given that money is the lifeblood of organised crime, removing access by organised crime groups to money is bound to erode their power base.     PROPOSAL     Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the prevention of and fight against organised crime in the financial sector [       COM(2004) 262      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The European Commission intends to develop and enhance a series of measures to prevent and fight either organised financial crime or general organised crime which influences organised financial crime.      Money laundering      The fight against money laundering has been a top political priority of the European Union (EU) for a number of years. The need to protect the financial system from misuse and the fear that the application of radically different measures in this area could prejudice the proper functioning of the Internal Market provided the European Commission with the legal basis under the Treaty for proposing Community legislation. Current legislation is basically composed of two Community Directives adopted in 1991 and 2001.     The Commission has announced its intention of tabling a proposal for a third Directive determining the changes to be made to the 1991 and 2001 Directives needed to take account of the revised 40 FATF Recommendations.     The Commission has already presented a proposal for a Regulation on the prevention of money laundering by means of customs cooperation. The proposal aims to set up a uniform approach to cash control based on a declaration system for amounts greater than EUR 15 000. It supplements the money-laundering Directives which govern,       inter alia      , the control of financial resources moving via financial institutions. There is indeed a risk that this control mechanism could be undermined by large-scale movements of cash which are not uniformly subject to control in the Community.     The Commission also proposes:      case tracking: Member States are encouraged to develop systems capable of tracking data provided by entities subject to reporting requirements;       the establishment of asset recovery bodies at national level: the Commission supports Europol's efforts to set up an "Asset Seizure Knowledge Centre" to facilitate the identification of criminal assets in the course of major criminal investigations conducted by Member States;       criminalising gross negligence resulting in a failure to comply with reporting obligations;       a study on the feasibility of Member States' establishing a database of currency exchange transactions which could be accessed by police and judicial authorities in money-laundering investigations;       giving consideration to an appropriate mechanism to facilitate an EU-wide response where financial havens are considered to represent a significant money laundering threat;       promoting rapid information exchange between law enforcement, FIUs and other organisations concerned with a view to detecting underground bank transactions, which generally leave no paper trail;       reinforcing Europol's anti-money-laundering efforts by implementing the computerised evaluation of the Suspicious Transaction Reports sent to their analysis system (SUSTRANS);       pursuing the FIU-NET project, which aims to link up financial intelligence units.       Fraud      Non-cash means of payment represent an important source of illicit revenue for organised crime groups through fraud and counterfeiting.     The Commission will:      publish in 2004 a report on progress achieved under the three-year Action Plan to prevent fraud. This plan was adopted in 2001 and aims to foster a more coherent approach to prevention in this field;       propose further initiatives. In particular, it will explore the possibility of drafting clear guidelines as to how public and private agencies may work together to combat fraud more effectively.      In addition to what has recently been achieved in this field, there is a need to explore the establishment of a common and comprehensive EC concept of fiscal fraud and the harmonisation of penal sanctions. The Commission intends to launch a comparative study of the respective definitions of fiscal fraud and their penal consequences.     Fraud affecting the financial interests of the Community also represents an important source of illicit revenue. The Community's own resources suffer huge losses as a result. To combat this problem, the Commission recommends:      enhanced cooperation between Member States, the Commission (         OLAF        ),         Eurojust        and possibly         Europol        ;       the creation of an independent European Public Prosecutor responsible for detecting and prosecuting offences directed against the Community's financial interests.       Transparency of certain legal entities      There is a general need to enhance transparency and integrity standards in public administrations and private entities to prevent and discourage financial crime in general and thus contribute to the more effective tracing of organised financial crime.     The Commission proposes:      speeding up work on the role of independent non-executive or supervisory directors;       carrying out cost benefit analyses in connection with the enhancement of transparency measures to help combat organised financial crime;       exploring new ways of preventing and combating financial malpractice, with a particular focus,         inter alia        , on companies' use of complex and opaque structures, subsidiaries and other special-purpose vehicles to commit and to conceal malpractices in the financial and taxation fields. One of the objectives could be to recommend a comprehensive and consistent EU approach for tackling such malpractices.      The Commission also intends to promote:      the development of cooperation between the private and public sectors, not only via the EU Forum for the Prevention of Organised Crime but also by encouraging greater research work in this area. It will also explore the scope for coordination between law enforcement/government officials and representatives of the financial and other business communities affected by organised financial crime.       the elaboration of a common policy on the development and implementation of financial investigations as an investigative technique. Standard rules for financial investigation bodies throughout the EU should also be considered, notably in connection with funding, training requirements and cooperation mechanisms of such bodies;       the setting of minimum standards for national criminal intelligence systems, in order to facilitate effective strategic and tactical analysis, forward planning and operations. To this end, the Commission proposes setting up a working group of representatives of the European Commission (including OLAF), Europol and Eurojust;       relevant data collection and statistical mechanisms with particular regard to organised financial crime;       further work on a mechanism to facilitate identification of legislative proposals which may inadvertently create opportunities for crime. At a subsequent stage, the Commission may if need be extend this form of crime risk assessment to areas beyond the legislative process. This could include procedures and processes surrounding such areas as insurance claim forms or credit card applications with a view to reducing opportunities for fraud;       a full evaluation of the effectiveness and impact of policy and measures in the fight against organised financial crime in the EU in 2005. The purpose of these evaluation missions will be to identify best practice and areas where additional measures in the fight against organised financial crime could be taken;       continued seminars, workshops and studies under its         AGIS        funding programme;       enhancing external action in the fight against organised financial crime, via technical assistance programmes for third countries and by entering into agreements with them (such as the agreement on mutual legal assistance in criminal justice concluded with the United States on 25 June 2003).       Background      This Communication addresses the problem of organised crime in the financial sector. The focus is therefore on non-violent crime generally involving abuse of financial and/or payment systems and resulting in illicit financial gain.     The European Commission sees the fight against organised financial crime as a core priority over the coming years, as financial crime is often wrongly perceived as a "victimless" crime. While organised financial crime may not always impact directly on individuals, the reality is that its broader social impact is considerable in terms of lost revenues, loss of reputation and the fall in public standards.

act   Communication from the Commission on a simplified business environment for companies in the areas of company law, accounting and auditing (  COM(2007) 394  final - not published in the Official Journal).   summary   Member States need to be able to respond flexibly to the business environment, benefiting from the EU legislative framework, but without restraint on innovation and high administrative costs restricting competitiveness. The Commission is re-examining EU directives and consulting with stakeholders on ways to bring legislation in line with a leaner and more effective  business environment  .   Company law   There are two options: complete or partial repeal of directives, where they are irrelevant to cross-border issues. This affects the following:   domestic  mergers  and  divisions  (third and sixth directives);   rules on the  capital of public limited liability companies  (second directive);   Rules on  single-member private limited liability companies  (twelfth directive)  simplifying  legislation and other measures seek to give Member States a wider flexibility in mergers and divisions by:   simplifying directors’ responsibilities on the provision of specific financial data;   removing the need for general meeting approval while still protecting creditors; Directive  2006/68/EC  amends legislation in this area.   The duty to publish certain information in the national gazettes in compliance with the first company law directive may be replaced by a simple registration service using the  European business register  (EBR), while rules on certified translation will similarly be simplified. Rules about a company’s registered office are also to be revised under the  European company statute  .   Accounting and auditing for SMEs   The European directives on accounting were revised in 2013 in order to limit unnecessary and disproportionate costs in the preparation of financial information. The result is a new accounting Directive  2013/34/EU  , to be implemented by mid-2015, which introduces criteria for defining micro, small, medium-sized and large businesses, and reduces the amount of information to be provided by micro and small undertakings to satisfy requirements.   Background   Initiated by the Commission in 2006, the  updated simplification programme  , and its  action programme  , following the  European Council  of 8 and 9 March 2007 identified company law, accounting and auditing as three priority areas.
   General arrangements for, and the holding and movement of, products subject to excise duty     General arrangements for, and the holding and movement of, products subject to excise duty     To ensure the free movement of excisable products, the present directive harmonises the general arrangements for such products at EU level.     ACT     Council Directive       92/12/EEC      of 25 February 1992 on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty and on the holding, movement and monitoring of such products [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     The present directive contains a consolidation of the directives on the arrangements for products subject to excise duty and other indirect taxes except for VAT and taxes established by the Community.     The directive defines the territory within which the directive in question and the specific Directives on the rates and structures of duty on products subject to excise duties are applicable.     The products covered by the directives are mineral oils, alcohol and alcoholic beverages, and manufactured tobacco. They may be subject to other indirect taxes levied for specific purposes.     Member States retain the right to introduce or maintain indirect taxes levied on products other than those mentioned above provided that those taxes do not give rise to border-crossing formalities.     Country in which the excise duty is chargeable:      products released for consumption in one Member State and held for commercial purposes in another Member State are subject to excise duty in the Member State in which they are held;       products acquired by private individuals for their own use and transported by them are taxed in the Member State in which they are acquired; various criteria have been established to enable individuals to prove that their purchases are for personal use;       products purchased by persons who are not authorised warehousekeepers or registered or non-registered traders and dispatched or transported directly or indirectly by the vendor or on his behalf are subject to excise duty in the Member State of destination.      Each Member State determines its rules concerning the production, processing and holding of products subject to excise duty, subject to the provisions of the Directives in question. Where excise duty has not been paid, the production, processing and holding of products are monitored under the tax warehousing arrangements.     The present directive establishes a procedure for the movement of products referred to by the Directive in question under suspension arrangements: the tax authorities in the Member States are informed by traders that carry out or receive supplies on the basis of an administrative or commercial accompanying document.     Where products subject to excise duty are released for consumption in a Member State and are intended to be moved to that same Member State via the territory of another Member State, the accompanying document must be used.     Information shown on the copies of the accompanying document intended for the competent authorities of the Member States of departure and destination may be transmitted by computerised means.     Internal transit documents and       TIR or ATA      Convention documents serve as the accompanying document for excise-duty purposes.     The lodging of a guarantee is compulsory to cover the risks inherent in the movement of goods. Member States may introduce provisions to guarantee the risks inherent in the production and storage of such goods.     The consignor may, subject to certain conditions, change the name and address of the consignee on the accompanying document.     In the case of frequent and regular movements of products subject to excise duty under suspension arrangements, the Member States may permit a reduction of discharge procedures.     Armed forces and international organisations are authorised to receive products under excise-duty suspension arrangements provided that an exemption certificate is attached to the accompanying document.     Small wine producers may be exempted from certain requirements under the general arrangements for excise duty.

   Global climate change alliance     Global climate change alliance     The European Union (EU) is proposing to launch a global alliance with the developing countries that are most vulnerable to climate change in order to help prepare them for confronting this challenge. By focusing on the least developed countries and small island States, the alliance will offer a structured dialogue and concrete cooperation on actions funded by the EU’s development policy.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 18 September 2007 – Building a global climate change alliance between the European Union and poor developing countries most vulnerable to climate change [       COM(2007) 540 final      – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Developing countries will be affected most by climate change, the poorest least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing States (SIDS) in particular, as these do not have sufficient resources to prepare for and adapt to current changes. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Africa is particularly vulnerable to this challenge. Specifically, Africa will be exposed to water stress, extreme weather events and food insecurity associated with drought and desertification.     The Global Climate Change Alliance (GCCA) aims at supporting the poorest and most vulnerable countries with respect to their capacity to adapt to the effects of climate change. It will provide a       platform for dialogue      and regular exchange between the EU and these countries, aiming at the integration of climate change in national development strategies and in development cooperation. This dialogue will also be conducted at regional level, for instance with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States , the African Union (AU), SIDS and also within the framework of the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM). The GCCA will also provide       financial and technical support      for adaptation measures and the integration of climate change into development strategies.     This exchange of views and experience outside the negotiating context will help to support the ongoing process under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), contribute to the convergence of visions between Europe and developing countries and feed into the development of a post-2012 climate agreement.     The Commission is proposing       five priority areas      , to be discussed and refined in the GCCA dialogue, namely:       Implementation of measures to adapt to climate change        , by supporting the development of national adaptation action plans in vulnerable countries other than LDCs and the implementation of these plans in LDCs and SIDS that have finalised them. Other measures proposed include financing pilot adaptation projects and supporting research into the impact of climate change in developing countries. The design of innovative adaptation solutions within the EU’s         7th research framework programme        and the         food security thematic programme        is also proposed.        Reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries        , by strengthening national capacities to monitor deforestation and developing national strategies to combat the phenomenon. Moreover, the EU is proposing the introduction of financial incentives and expansion of the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (         FLEGT        ) initiative.        Enhancement of participation in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM),        thanks to the strengthening of capacities and technical support for cost-effective project development, as well as showcasing projects that are better suited to the specific conditions in LDCs and SIDS.        Promotion of disaster risk reduction (DRR),        by improving climate forecasting and information systems, and the translation of collected data into effective preparedness measures. Moreover, the Commission is proposing to support the strengthening of regional capacities for confronting the risk of climate-related disasters and the design of measures aimed at assisting developing countries in the implementation of the         Hyogo framework        .        Integration of climate change into poverty reduction strategies and programmes.        This involves promoting the inclusion of adaptation plans in development strategies and strengthening the institutional capacity of LDCs and SIDS so that they take climate change into account when preparing national policies. Moreover, the Commission is proposing to undertake environmental assessments for EU-funded development projects and programmes. Specifically, the Commission intends to systematically address the climate change issue on the occasion of the mid-term review of country and regional strategy papers.       Financing      The GCCA will be financed chiefly through the “Environment       and sustainable management of natural resources, including energy      ” thematic programme, for which an additional €50 million have been allocated for the 2008-2010 period. Moreover, resources earmarked under the 10th European Development Fund (       EDF      ), i.e. the national and regional envelopes that can contribute to the GCCA, and about €200 million under the intra-ACP programme in the area of climate change, the environment and disaster risk prevention will be available.     The Commission is also calling on Member States to contribute to the financing of the GCCA, by allocating part of the increase in public development aid that they have committed themselves to achieving before 2010. A joint GCCA financing mechanism managed by the Commission is being explored.      Context      The strong link between climate change and poverty was highlighted by the EU in       2003      . The idea of establishing a Global Alliance for confronting climate change was proposed in June 2007 in the       Green Paper on adapting to climate change in Europe      , which contains a pillar on integrating adaptation into EU external actions. As a follow-up to the       European Council conclusions of March 2007      , the Green Paper called for enhanced dialogue and cooperation between the EU and developing countries in this area.

act   Directive  2000/25/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2000 on action to be taken against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants by engines intended to power agricultural or forestry tractors and amending Council Directive 74/150/EEC [  See amending acts  ].   summary   This Directive details the action to be taken against air pollution by agricultural or forestry tractors. It therefore aims to reduce the level of pollutants emitted while ensuring the smooth functioning of the internal market.   Vehicles involved   This Directive deals with the requirements concerning emissions by agricultural and forestry tractors . They concern, in particular, the definition of the component type-approval procedures applying to engines intended to be fitted to tractors and thus also the definition of the type-approval procedures for such vehicles in terms of their pollutant emissions.   Obligations to be complied with   The manufacturer of the vehicle shall submit an application for type-approval concerning the pollutants emitted. They must provide certain information relating to the vehicle, such as the type of motor.  The manufacturer shall also comply with certain specifications concerning tests, engine marking and the conformity of production.  Replacement motors shall comply with the limit values which were applicable to the motor to be replaced at the time when the later was placed on the market.   Flexibility mechanism   A limited number of tractors may be placed in service on the condition that they are equipped with a motor approved in accordance with the requirements relating to the emissions limits of the phase immediately prior to that which is applicable.  The number of these tractors placed on the market under the framework of the flexibility mechanism shall not exceed 40 % of the annual number of tractors placed on the market by the manufacturer.   Limit values   The Directive has the same test requirements as have been adopted for  off-road mobile machinery  and the corresponding limit values for levels of emissions.  At the same time, the Directive comes within the field of the type-approval procedure for agricultural or forestry tractors put in place by  Directive 2003/37/EC  .  As it draws a distinction between four chemical pollutants - carbon monoxide (CO), unburned hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxide (NOx) and particulates (PT) - the Directive supplements Directive  77/537/EEC  on action to be taken against pollutants emitted by diesel engines intended to power tractors.  This directive is repealed by Regulation (EU) No  167/2013  with effect from 1 January 2016.

summary of   Regulation (EU) 2019/712 — on safeguarding competition in air transport   what is the aim of the regulation   It aims to ensure fair competition between EU air carriers and air carriers located in non-EU countries by providing the  European Commission  with powers to investigate and take measures against non-EU air carriers engaged in unfair commercial practices.   It repeals Regulation (EC) No  868/2004  whilst strengthening the rules that regulation had set out.   key points    Scope   The regulation provides for rules relating to practices distorting competition between EU air carriers and non-EU air carriers and causing, or threatening to cause, injury  *  to EU air carriers.   Launching an investigation   Following a  written complaint  by an  EU country or an association of EU air carriers  or on its own initiative, the Commission will carry an investigation if there is clear (  prima facie  ) evidence of the following circumstances:    1.    a practice distorting competition, adopted by a non-EU country or a non-EU entity;      2.    injury or threat of injury to one or more EU air carriers; and      3.    a causal link between the alleged practice and the alleged injury or threat of injury.      The investigation    If necessary, the Commission may investigate in the territory of a non-EU country.   The investigation can be suspended if it appears more appropriate to address the unfair practice distorting competition under the  dispute settlement procedures  established by an applicable air transport or air services agreement;   the investigation can be resumed if corrective action has not been promptly taken or   the practice distorting competition has not been eliminated within 12 months from the date the investigation was suspended.     The Commission must inform the non-EU country, entity or air carrier concerned as well as the complainant, the interested parties, the EU countries and the EU air carriers concerned of its reasons for taking or not taking measures to redress the issue raised.   The investigation must be concluded within  12 months  and the proceedings within  20 months  of its launch. Both can be prolonged in justified cases.    Injury or risk of injury   The investigation of  injury  is based on evidence and takes into account the following factors:   the  situation of the EU air carriers concerned  , notably in terms of aspects such as frequency of services, utilisation of capacity, network effect, sales, market share, profits, return on capital, investment and employment;   the  general situation on the affected air-transport services markets  , notably in terms of level of fares or rates, capacity and frequency of air-transport services or use of the network.   A determination of a  threat of injury  is based on clear evidence and not merely on allegation, conjecture or remote possibility.   Redressive measures   If the investigation determines that a practice distorting competition adopted by a non-EU country or entity has caused injury to an EU air carrier, the Commission can impose redressive measures through  implementing acts  . These measures can be either:   financial duties;   any operational measure of equivalent or lesser value, such as the suspension of concessions  *  , of services owed or of other rights of the non-EU air carrier.   The Commission will not impose redressive measures if:   any of the 3 initial conditions is not fulfilled;   it is against the EU interest;   the non-EU country or entity has eliminated either the practice distorting competition or the injury or threat of injury to EU air carriers.    EU interest    A determination of the EU interest is made by the Commission on the basis of an appreciation of all the various interests, which are relevant to the situation;   priority is given to protecting consumer interests and maintaining a high level of connectivity for passengers and for the EU;   the need to eliminate the practice distorting competition, to restore effective and fair competition, and to avoid any distortion to the internal market is also taken into account.     The EU interest is determined on the basis of an economic analysis by the Commission.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 30 May 2019.   background     Air transport  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Injury:  in this context, injury to an air carrier could involve harm arising from unfair competition leading, for example, to a loss in market share.   Concession:  in this context, the right granted to an airline to fly a given route.

The         implementing decisions        mostly concern          harmonisation         , while others deal with         specific frequency bands for specific purposes        , in addition to limits on signal strength and harmful interference where applicable. EU countries are responsible for         radio spectrum management        , and the amendments reflect how European and international harmonisation and technical agreements have evolved.       The ‘DECT’ directive designates the 1 880-1 900 MHz frequency band for digital cordless communications by 1 January 1992 and obliges EU countries to bring into force the necessary national laws, regulations and administrative rules.      KEY POINTS      The decisions      The implementing decisions cover radio equipment devices that are operated through general authorisation or on an unlicensed or shared basis by end-users. This includes radio local access network devices (wi-fi) devices which have shown massive growth in demand for radio spectrum, as acknowledged in the       2018 European Electronic Communications Code      .     Many of these acts are harmonisation decisions. Others deal with frequency bands for different purposes, such as a huge variety of       short range devices      ,       Internet of Things      (IoT) equipment, ultra-wide band equipment, alarms, door openers, medical implants, intelligent transport systems, radio frequency identification devices (RFID), radio determination, ground probing, and new types of machine-to-machine devices, as well as equipment for programme making and special events (PMSE) such as wireless video links or microphones and digital cordless telephones.     A further general authorisation band relates to       vehicle safety      , in particular to the operation of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS).     The various implementing decisions cover the following radio spectrum, in addition to limits on signal strength and harmful interference where applicable:      the         5 GHz frequency band        (5 150-5 350 MHz and 5 470-5 725 MHz) for         wireless access systems        , including radio local area networks (WAS/RLANs — wi-fi broadband);       the         3 400-3 800 MHz frequency band        for         terrestrial systems        for ‘fixed, nomadic and mobile electronic communications networks’;       the         5 875-5 935 MHz frequency band        for safety-related applications of         Intelligent Transport Systems        ;       the radio spectrum for use by         short-range devices        ;       the         24 GHz range radio spectrum band        for the time-limited use by         automotive short-range radar equipment        ;       radio spectrum use by         wireless audio programme-making and special events equipment        ;       the         2 010-2 025 MHz frequency band        for         portable or mobile wireless video links and cordless cameras        used for programme making and special events;       the         900 MHz and 1 800 MHz frequency bands        for terrestrial systems capable of providing electronic communications services in relation to the         Internet of Things        ;       radio spectrum for use by short-range devices within the         874-876 and 915-921 MHz frequency bands        ;       radio spectrum for equipment using         ultra-wideband technology        , such as vehicle and aircraft location tracking.

summary of   Directive 2006/116/EC on the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights   what is the aim of the directive  It seeks to harmonise the term of protection of  copyright   *  and certain  related rights   *  .  It  codifies  and repeals Directive  93/98/EEC  which harmonised the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights.   key points   The term of protection of copyright for a  literary or artistic work  is set at  70 years  from:   the death of the author of the work, or the death of the last surviving author in the case of a work of joint ownership;   the date on which the work was lawfully made available to the public if it is anonymous or was produced under a pseudonym.   The term of protection for a  film or audiovisual work  is set at  70 years  after the death of the last survivor among the following:   the principal director;   the author of the screenplay;   the author of the dialogue; and   the composer of music specifically created for use in the film or audiovisual work.   The directive was amended by Directive  2011/77/EU  which extended the length of protection for  music recordings  . This was because performers often start their careers early, and the term of 50 years for  fixations of performances  , such as recordings, did not protect their performances for the full extent of their lifetime. Thus it extends the rights of performers and phonogram producers on music recordings from  50 to 70 years  .  Directive 2011/77/EU also harmonises the way of calculating the term of protection for songs, and other musical compositions with words, created by several authors. The term of protection expires  70 years  after the death of the  last person to survive  (i.e. of the author of the lyrics or the composer of the music).   Related rights   The term of protection of related rights (film producers and broadcasting organisations) is  50 years  . This is calculated on a case-by-case basis from the date of the performance, the publication or communication of its fixation. The term of protection of performers and phonogram producers was extended to 70 years by Directive 2011/77/EU.   Calculating terms   The term of protection begins simultaneously in all EU countries. It is calculated from 1 January of the year following the event giving rise to it.   Protection of works originating in non-EU countries   If the work originates in a non-EU country and the author is not an EU national, the protection granted in the EU ends at the final date of protection in the country of origin, but must not exceed the term set in the EU.   Notification   EU countries must communicate to the  European Commission  immediately any plans for new related rights.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 16 January 2007.  The Directive 2006/116/EC  codifies  and replaces Council Directive  93/98/EEC  which had to become law in the EU countries by 1995.   background   For more information, see:    EU copyright legislation  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Copyright:  protects the interests of creators by giving them property rights over their creations or works.   Related rights:  these protect the legal interests of persons and bodies who either:   contribute to making works available to the public; or   produce subject matter which, although it does not qualify as ‘works’ under the copyright systems of all countries, expresses creativity or technical and organisational skill sufficient to justify recognition of a copyright-like property right.
act   Commission recommendation  2012/417/EU  of 17 July 2012 on access to and preservation of scientific information (2012/417/EU)   summary   In July 2012, the European Commission proposed ways for EU countries to improve access to scientific information produced in Europe.  Broader and more rapid access  to scientific papers and data will make it easier for researchers and businesses to build on the findings of publicly funded research. The idea here is that this will  boost Europe’s innovation capacity  and give citizens  quicker access to the benefits of scientific discoveries  .   Open access policies  aim to provide readers with access to peer-reviewed scientific publications and research data free of charge as early as possible in the dissemination process and enable the use and reuse of scientific research results.   Open access to publications   The Commission recommends that EU Member States define clear policies to ensure the dissemination of and open access to scientific publications resulting from publicly funded research.   Aims of these policies include:    open access to publications resulting from publicly funded research as soon as possible, preferably immediately and in any case no later than 6 months after the date of publication (and 12 months for social sciences and humanities);   licensing systems that contribute to open access to scientific publications resulting from publicly funded research;   an academic career system that supports and rewards researchers who participate in a culture of sharing the results of their research;   more transparency, in particular by informing the public about agreements between public institutions or groups of public institutions and publishers for the supply of scientific information;   small and medium-sized enterprises and unaffiliated researchers having the widest and cheapest possible access to scientific publications of the results of research that receives public funding.    Preservation and reuse of scientific information   The Commission also has a range of proposals relating to the preservation and reuse of scientific information. These include ensuring the long-term preservation of research results, ensuring that an effective system of deposit for electronic scientific information is in place and preserving the hardware and software needed to read the information in future or by migrating the information to new software and hardware environments on a regular basis.   E-infrastructures   The Commission has also come up with a set of recommendations for the further development of e-infrastructures to facilitate the flow of scientific information. One of these is to support the development and training of new cohorts of data-intensive computational science experts, including data specialists, technicians and data managers.  The Commission also suggests that EU Member States appoint a  national point of reference  to:   coordinate the measures in this recommendation;   act as an interlocutor with the Commission on questions relating to access to and preservation of scientific information;   report on the follow-up to this recommendation.

summary of   Communication (COM(2011) 12 final) — Developing the European Dimension in Sport    Article 6 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)   what is the aim of the communication and the treaty article  Building on the 2007  White Paper on sport  , it sets out a list of initiatives that can be taken at EU level to further strengthen sport’s  role in society  , its  economic dimension  and its  organisation  .  Article 6 TFEU gives the EU powers to carry out actions to support, coordinate or supplement EU countries’ action in areas such as sport, education and culture.   Key points   The communication presents the issues to be addressed at EU level under  3 broad themes  . The initiatives to be taken are intended to provide added value by  supporting and complementing  EU countries’ own actions in the field of sport.    Sport’s role in society     Sport can make a  positive contribution  to growth, citizens’ employability and social cohesion, while helping to reduce health spending. However, it continues to face threats related to doping, violence and intolerance, against which action must be taken to  protect athletes and citizens  .   The  use of doping substances  poses serious public health hazards, so it is necessary to step up the  fight against doping  . The key parties involved in the sports sector called for the EU to join the Council of Europe’s Anti-Doping Convention, so the  European Commission  is to propose a draft mandate for negotiating the EU’s accession. It is also essential to reinforce measures preventing organised networks’ trade in doping substances. The Commission is to examine ways to do this, including through the introduction of criminal law. The Commission already supports several organisations that play an important role in the fight against doping, such as the  World Anti-Doping Agency  . It will continue supporting  transnational anti-doping networks  .   The  quality of sports programmes in educational institutions  is not satisfactory in several EU countries. The quality of sport training centres and their staff should be high enough to safeguard athletes’ moral, educational and professional interests. To support education, training and qualifications in sport, the Commission and EU countries are to:   draw up  EU guidelines on dual careers  for athletes to ensure that quality education is provided alongside sport training;   support the  referencing of sport-related qualifications  to the  European Qualifications Framework  ;   promote the recognition and validation of non-formal  *  and informal  *  learning gained through sport-related activities.     A European approach is needed to  prevent and fight against violence and intolerance  , which continue to pose problems to European sport. The Commission and EU countries therefore are to develop and implement security arrangements and safety requirements covering a wide range of sport disciplines (currently only  international football events  are covered). Furthermore, the Commission is to support the fight against intolerance in sport and encourage EU countries to fully and effectively enforce the Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA on  combating racism and xenophobia  .   Sport is fundamental for improving physical activity, which is an essential health determinant in today’s society. To enhance health through sport, the Commission and EU countries are working on national guidelines to encourage people to  include physical activity in their daily lives  , based on the 2008 EU Physical Activity Guidelines. There are great differences between EU countries regarding the concept of  health-enhancing physical activity  . To overcome these differences, the Commission is to support  transnational projects and networks  in this area.   Social inclusion can be improved in and through sport. The Commission and EU countries are to:   draw up accessibility standards for sport through the  European Disability Strategy  ;   further promote the participation of persons with disabilities in sporting activities;   support transnational projects that promote women’s access to sport and disadvantaged groups’ social integration through sport.       Sport’s economic dimension     Sport is an ever-growing sector of the economy that contributes to growth and jobs. There is a need for comparable data to form the basis of evidence-based policymaking and for sustaining sport financing, in particular non-profit sport.    Evidence-based policymaking  is essential for implementing EU sport rules. The Commission and EU countries are to produce  satellite accounts for sport  to measure its economic importance. The Commission is also to provide support to a network of universities to promote innovative sport policies, as well as study the possibility of setting up an EU sport monitoring function.   The sustainable financing of sport must be ensured.  Intellectual property rights (IPRs)  are an important source of revenue in the professional sports field; consequently, the Commission is to:   consider IPRs from the coverage of sporting events in the implementation of the Digital Agenda initiative (and the subsequent  digital single market strategy  );   study the funding of grass roots sport, which will inform future action in this field.     Together with EU countries, the Commission is to examine how the  financial solidarity mechanisms in the sports sector  may be strengthened.   So far, there have only been a few decisions on the application of EU  state aid  rules to sport. The Commission is to monitor state aid law in the area of sport and to consider providing guidance if the number of state aid cases increases.   Sport is a valuable tool for  regional development  and  employability  . To take advantage of this, the Commission and the EU countries will make full use of the  European Structural and Investment Funds  to support  sustainable sports structures  .     Sports organisation     The  autonomy and self-regulation of sport organisations  is underpinned by  good governance  in the sector. To promote good governance in sport at the European level, the Commission and EU countries are to endorse common standards through the exchange of good practice and by providing targeted support to specific initiatives.   To ensure the concept of the  specific nature of sport  is applied correctly, the Commission is to provide guidance:    theme-by-theme  on the relationship between EU law and sporting rules;   on EU rules relating to the  free movement and nationality of sportspeople  , with a view to the organisation of  non-discriminatory competitions  in individual sports on a national basis;   on transfer rules, as player transfers often raise questions about their legality and the financing involved. The Commission was to assess both the  economic  and  legal aspects  relating to such transfers.     The  activities of sport agents  also raise ethical questions; consequently, the Commission organised a  conference  to examine ways in which agents’ activities may be improved.   Within the  professional football sector  , a  European social dialogue committee  was launched in 2008. Several organisations have called for the creation of a European  social dialogue  for the  whole sport sector  , which the Commission is backing. To facilitate this process, the Commission is to propose a test phase for the relevant  social partners  .   background   For more information, see:    Sport  (  European Commission  )    2008 EU physical activity guidelines  (  European Commission  )    Anti-Doping Convention  (  Council of Europe)     Sport — health and participation  (  European Commission  )    Sport — social inclusion  (  European Commission  )    Sport — sport statistics  (  European Commission  )    Sport — sustainable financing  (  European Commission  )    Study on grassroots sports funding  (  European Commission  )   key terms    Non-formal learning:  organised learning, building on an individual’s skills and capacities and often led by a teacher, but which does not result in a formal diploma.

summary of   European Commission communication (COM(2016) 110 final) — the implications of the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Convention on Climate Change   what is the aim of the communication   It sets out the key features of the  Paris Agreement  and how the European Union (EU) is implementing them.   Leading by example, it aims to encourage its international partners in their efforts in making the switchover to a low carbon economy.   key points    The Paris Agreement provides a global action plan to tackle climate change. This includes:   limiting global warming to well below 2  o  C above pre-industrial levels and efforts to keep temperature increase to 1.5  o  C;   holding a ‘global stocktake’ every 5 years, starting in 2023, to analyse the progress made;   ensuring a legal obligation on signatories to take domestic mitigation  *  measures;   introducing stronger transparency and accountability measures with, for example, publication of greenhouse gas inventories every 2 years;   providing financial and other support to help less wealthy countries take the necessary adaptation  *  measures.     The agreement was opened for signature on 22 April 2016 and entered into force on 4 November 2016.   The  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  will report in 2018 on the policy implications of the 1.5  o  C goal.   To implement the Paris Agreement, the EU will:   implement its  ‘Energy union’ project  , moving away from a fossil fuel economy;   support research and development for  low-carbon innovation  ;   use EU finance, such as the  European Fund for Strategic Investments  , and policies, notably the  Capital Markets Union  , to encourage greater private investment;   use its own experience of  carbon emissions pricing  to encourage other countries to take similar measures;   encourage  civil society  at large — the public, industry and trade unions, and companies large and small — to contribute towards the goals;   emphasise the importance of  climate action  in its wide-ranging policy agenda with international partners, including special help for developing countries;   present various proposals, in areas such as  energy efficiency  and  renewable energy  , to meet its own 2030 climate and energy targets. Domestically, the EU aims to reduce its own greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030.     background   At the Paris climate conference (COP21) in December 2015, 195 countries adopted the Paris Agreement, the first-ever universal, legally binding global climate deal.  The agreement entered into force after at least 55 countries, accounting for at least 55% of global emissions, ratified the agreement.  For more information, see:    ‘Paris Agreement’  on the European Commission's website    ‘Paris Agreement’  on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change website.   * key terms     Mitigation:  action, such as switching to renewable and nuclear energy, to address the root causes of climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.     Adaptation:  action, such as defences against rising sea levels, to lower the risks from the consequences of climate change.
summary of    Regulation (EEC) No 4055/86 applying the principle of freedom to provide services to maritime transport between EU countries and with non-EU countries     Regulation (EEC) No 4057/86 on unfair pricing practices in maritime transport     Regulation (EEC) No 4058/86 on coordinated action to safeguard free access to cargoes in ocean trades     Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 on the implementation of the rules on competition laid down in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty     Regulation (EC) No 246/2009 on the application of Article 81(3) of the Treaty to certain categories of agreements, decisions and concerted practices between liner shipping companies (consortia)     Regulation (EC) No 906/2009 on the application of Article 81(3) of the Treaty to certain categories of agreements, decisions and concerted practices between liner shipping companies (consortia)    what is the aim of the regulations  They aim to organise maritime transport in accordance with the basic principles of EU law to  provide services  ,  competition  , and  free access to the market  in sea transport.   key points    Freedom to provide services    Regulation No 4055/86:    grants EU-country nationals (and non-EU shipping companies using ships registered in an EU country and controlled by EU nationals) the  right to carry passengers or goods by sea  between any port of an EU country and any port or offshore installation of another EU country or of a non-EU country;   requires any  national restrictions  which reserve the carriage of goods to vessels flying the national flag  to be phased out or adjusted  , and prevents the introduction of new restrictions;   sets out a  procedure  for cases where EU-country shipping companies have no effective opportunity to carry goods to and from a particular non-EU country;    extends the benefits  of the regulation to  non-EU nationals established in the EU  .   Regulation No  3577/92/EEC  deals specifically with freedom to provide services in sea transport within EU countries (‘maritime cabotage’  *  ).   Unfair pricing in maritime transport    Regulation No 4057/86:    authorises the EU to apply  redressive duties  in order to protect shipowners in EU countries from unfair pricing practices on the part of non-EU shipowners. These redressive duties can be imposed after an investigation which demonstrates that injury has been caused by unfair pricing and that the interests of the EU make intervention necessary;   concerning the  examination of injury  , lays down the appropriate factors or indicators to be taken into consideration, e.g. a reduction in the shipowner’s market share or profits, or the effect on employment;   lays down a  procedure  for complaints, consultations and subsequent investigations.    Free access to ocean trades    Regulation No 4058/86:    applies when action by a non-EU country or by its agents  restricts free access  to the transport of liner cargoes, bulk cargoes or other cargoes by shipping companies of EU countries or by ships registered in an EU country (except where such action is taken in conformity with the  United Nations liner code  );   allows for  coordinated action by the EU  following a request made by an EU country to the  European Commission  . Such action might include diplomatic representation to non-EU countries and countermeasures directed at the shipping companies concerned;   permits similar coordinated action to be taken at the request of another country belonging to the  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  with which a  reciprocal arrangement  has been concluded.    Competition rules   General EU competition laws laid down in  Regulation (EC) No 1/2003  also apply to the EU maritime transport sector. However, in accordance with  Council Regulation (EC) No 246/2009  , the Commission may make exceptions for certain types of cooperation between liner shipping  *  companies (consortia  *  ). The Commission accordingly adopted  Regulation (EC) No 906/2009  , which allows these exceptions, and extended it until 25 April 2020 by Regulation (EU) No  697/2014  .   from when do the regulations apply   Council Regulation (EEC) No 4055/86 has applied since 1 January 1987.   Council Regulations (EEC) No 4057/86 and 4058/86 have applied since 1 July 1987.   Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 has applied since 1 May 2004.   Council Regulation (EC) No 246/2009 has applied since 14 April 2009.

summary of   Regulation (EU) 2019/1700 establishing a common framework for European statistics relating to persons and households, based on data at individual level collected from samples   what is the aim of the regulation   It sets up a common system for European statistics relating to  persons and households   *  based on data at  individual level  collected from samples.   It  amends  Regulations (EC) No  808/2004  on  statistics on the information society  , (EC) No  452/2008  on  statistics on education and lifelong learning  , and (EC) No  1338/2008  on  statistics on public health/health and safety at work  , and  repeals  Regulation (EC) No  1177/2003  of the European Parliament and of the Council, and Council Regulation (EC) No  577/98  , from 1 January 2021.   key points   The  statistical population  consists of all persons having their usual residence in private households  *  in each EU country.  The data collection must be carried out in each EU country for a  sample of observation units  constituted by private households or by persons belonging to private households who have their usual residence in that EU country.   Domains and topics   The regulation covers statistics that are organised into the  domains and topics  detailed in its Annex I. The  data collection  must be organised into the following  domains  :   labour market;   income and living conditions;   health;   education and training;   use of information and communication technologies;   time use; and   consumption.   For  all domains  , the data sets must cover the following  common topics  :   technical items;   person and household characteristics;   labour market participation;   educational attainment and background;   health: status and disability, access to, availability and use of health care and health determinants.   Besides the topics common to all domains, the data sets must cover the following  topics  :   job tenure, work biography and previous work experience;   working conditions including working hours and working time arrangements;   participation in education and training;   income, consumption and elements of wealth (e.g. house ownership), including debts;   living conditions, including material deprivation, housing, living environment and access to services;   quality of life, including social, civil, economic and cultural participation, inclusion and well-being;   participation in the information society, and   allocation of time (optional).     Delegated  and  implementing acts    The  European Commission  may adopt delegated acts to:   amend the detailed themes listed in Annex I to take into account relevant developments and to respond to new user needs;   put in place and adapt a multiannual rolling plan covering 8 years; and   define the number and title of variables to be collected.   The Commission may adopt implementing acts on the  technical specifications  of:   data sets;   technical formats for the transmission of information;   characteristics of sampling frames;   quality reports; and   technical characteristics for items common to several datasets.   EU countries must start transmitting the data to the Commission (  Eurostat  ) in line with this regulation from 2021.  Five  annexes  provide detailed information on:   topics to be covered;   accuracy requirements;   sample characteristics;   frequency; and   deadlines for data transmission.    Pilot and feasibility studies   The Commission will launch feasibility and pilot studies with a view to improving the quality of the data sets and social indicators. These studies, funded by the Commission, would cover:   data comparability,   developing new methodologies,   modernising data collection, and   users’ new demands, especially addressing populations that are difficult to reach, data on specific sub‐populations, in particular those that are the most vulnerable, making available statistics at  NUTS 2 territorial level  , and producing data at detailed local level in a cost‐effective and responsive manner.   In accordance with the EU’s  Financial Regulation  (Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046), where appropriate, the EU can provide grants to EU countries, in particular for capacity‐building.   from when does the regulation apply  It applies from 1 January 2021. However, in respect of the domains of time use and of consumption, it applies from 1 January 2025.   background   For more information, see:    People in the EU — statistics on household and family structures  (  Eurostat  ).   key terms    Household:  a social unit:   having common arrangements;   sharing household expenses or daily needs;   in a shared common residence.    A household includes either one person living alone or a group of people, not necessarily related, living at the same address with common housekeeping, i.e. sharing at least one meal per day or sharing a living or sitting room.    Private household:  a social unit that is not a collective/institutional household such as a military barracks or a residential home for older people.
summary of   Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 – common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Aviation Safety Agency   summary    what does this regulation do  Its main aim is to set out the main rules and principles to establish and maintain a high uniform level of civil aviation safety in Europe, including the creation of a  European Aviation Safety Agency  (EASA).  Common safety rules offer a uniform level of requirements for operators*, manufacturers and aviation personnel. This in turn enables the free movement of products, persons and services in the EU market and allows for mutual recognition by EU countries of certificates*. This reduces the administrative burden and workload for the national authorities and the industry.  The regulation also seeks to:   ensure a high level of  environmental protection,    facilitate  free movement  of goods, persons and services,   promote  cost-efficiency  in the regulatory and certification* processes.   key points   This EU law applies to the design, production, maintenance and operation of aeronautical product parts and equipment, as well as to personnel and organisations involved in these activities.  One of the main means of achieving the above objectives is through the establishment of  EASA  . The law sets out the tasks, internal structure, working methods and final requirements of the Agency.  The main  tasks  of EASA include:   adopting opinions on civil aviation safety in Europe,   supporting the  European Commission  on measures to implement the law including those relating to technical matters such as construction and design,   conducting inspections and investigations necessary for it to fulfil its tasks.   Regarding  internal structure  , the law sets out the main rules of the agency including legal status, the powers and composition of the Management Board, and the powers and functions of the Executive Director.  In addition to EASA, the law sets out common rules for aviation safety including:    airworthiness:  requiring aircraft to have a valid airworthiness certificate including specific certificates for products, parts and aircraft design,    environmental protection:  requiring compliance of aircraft products, parts and appliances with relevant EU and global environmental protection provisions,    flight crew certification:  requiring pilots to hold an appropriate licence and medical certificate and training organisations to hold appropriate certificates,    aerodromes and air traffic control:  requiring certificates guaranteeing the safety of aerodromes* and the holding of appropriate certificates by air traffic controllers.   A range of related matters are also addressed by the law. They include  oversight and enforcement, recognition of certificates  and  acceptance of non-EU certificates  .   from when does the regulation apply  It entered into force on 8 April 2008.   background    the  European Aviation Safety Policy pages on the European Commission’s website    the  Regulations pages on the European Aviation Safety Agency’s website    key terms    * Operator  : any legal or natural person, operating or proposing to operate 1 or more aircraft.   * Certificate  : any approval, licence or other document issued as the result of certification.   * Certification  : any form of recognition that a product, part or appliance, organisation or person complies with the applicable requirements. It also covers the issuing of the relevant certificate attesting that compliance.   * Aerodrome  : any place where flight operations can take place ranging from landing strips to large international airports.   act   Regulation (EC) No  216/2008  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 February 2008 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Aviation Safety Agency, and repealing Council Directive 91/670/EEC, Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 and Directive 2004/36/EC (OJ L 79, 19.3.2008, pp. 1–49)  Successive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 have been incorporated into the basic text.

   Strategic Partnership with South Africa     Strategic Partnership with South Africa     This communication proposes that a strategic partnership be established between the European Union (EU) and South Africa, building on existing relations between the two parties and a strengthened political dialogue. The aim of the partnership is to promote peace, security and stability in Africa and allow closer cooperation between the two parties at regional, continental and world level. It also sets out to enhance existing cooperation on development and trade and to extend cooperation to other fields.     ACT     Communication of 28 June 2006 from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament - Towards an EU-South Africa Strategic Partnership [       COM(2006) 347      final - not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Since the first elections by universal suffrage which consolidated the end of apartheid in 1994, South Africa has made remarkable progress in a number of areas. It has created a democratic society based on equity, non-racialism and respect for the rights of religious, cultural, linguistic and indigenous communities, and has brought about internal and external macroeconomic stability. However, there are still wide social and economic disparities affecting the whole of South African society. Also, the prevalence of HIV/AIDS has reached an alarmingly high rate and the Government's efforts to stem crime have not yet borne fruit.     South Africa plays an important role at regional and global level. It is part of the Southern African Customs Union and accounts for 75% of the total GDP of the Southern African Development Community (SADC). It is also one of the founding countries of the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) and plays a key role in the African Union (AU). On the international scene it is one of the leading members of the Non-Aligned Movement and a very active member of the group of 20 emerging countries (also as part of the BRICS group, alongside Brazil, Russia, India and China). South Africa is also a member of the WTO and the Commonwealth.      South Africa and the EU      South Africa and the EU share common values such as democracy, human rights, respect for the rule of law and good governance, tolerance, equality, a commitment to fight poverty and social exclusion, and the promotion of sustainable development. The legal basis for relations between South Africa and the EU is the Trade Development and Cooperation Agreement (       TDCA      ). In particular, all relations between the parties are overseen by the "Cooperation Council", a joint ministerial body that maintains political dialogue.     The EU is South Africa's main trade partner, and South Africa is the EU's main African partner.     In terms of development cooperation, the EU is the leading donor, providing around 70% of total aid. The two partners have also concluded agreements in other fields, for example       scientific and technological cooperation      and trade in       wines      and       spirits      .      A strategic partnership between the EU and South Africa      This communication follows up the conclusions of the Joint Cooperation Council in November 2004 and 2005, which acknowledged the need to establish a more coherent strategic framework between the EU and South Africa. The purpose of the proposed partnership is to pursue strategic political cooperation and shared objectives with regard to regional, African and global issues. It also seeks to enhance existing cooperation and to extend it to other fields.     The essential component of the partnership is active political cooperation, which enables the two parties to find common ground on issues of mutual interest, to support each other's political agendas and to take joint political action. As regards the development of trade relations, it is proposed that the free-trade agreement provided for in the TDCA be replaced by a harmonised regional trade regime under the economic partnership agreement for Southern Africa, incorporating new commitments on matters such as services, government procurement and investment. The strategic partnership also seeks to extend cooperation to regional policy and social cohesion and to step up economic cooperation.     The 2007-2013 development cooperation programme, signed in Pretoria on 10 October 2007, takes into account the country's specific context and needs. For example, it must ensure the protection of natural resources and the environment, address the bottlenecks in the delivery of social services and take account of the South African government's economic policy.     Because of its key position in the SADC, South Africa plays a crucial role in implementing the SADC's Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan and hence in the regional integration of Southern Africa.     For the continent as a whole, South Africa is one of the driving forces of the AU and NEPAD, an important investor and an active player in conflict prevention. It is therefore important that a closer partnership between South Africa and the EU should encompass political and diplomatic cooperation on African issues, in particular security and peacekeeping.     Finally, the partnership envisages cooperation on the global scene and in international organisations, with the aim of defining a common position and defending the mutual interests of the two parties on global issues, for example countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, abolishing the death penalty and combating terrorism.     RELATED ACTS     The partnership proposed in the Commission communication was endorsed       in General Affairs Council Conclusions      of 17 October 2006 and the joint declaration by the EU-South Africa Cooperation Council of 14 November 2006.      EU-South Africa strategic partnership - joint action plan       adopted on 14 May 2007      The joint action plan for implementing the strategic partnership between the EU and South Africa establishes the Mogôbagôba dialogue, which will cover existing areas of cooperation (development, trade, science and technology) and promote cooperation in other fields such as the environment, climate change, regional policy, information and communication technologies, social affairs, education and training, culture and the crackdown on international crime. The cornerstone of the strategic partnership is strengthened political dialogue. In particular, the two parties have now agreed to meet twice a year: once at ministerial and once at the level of Heads of State and Government.     Last updated: 19.12.2007  
   Agricultural commodities, dependence and poverty     Agricultural commodities, dependence and poverty     The Commission has drawn up an action plan to help developing countries dependent on commodities such as coffee, sugar, cotton and cocoa, and the producers of those commodities. It sets two overall objectives: raising the earnings of producers of traditional and other commodities and reducing the vulnerability of earnings at both producer and macroeconomic levels.     ACT     Communication of 12 February 2004 from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament: Agricultural commodity chains, dependence and poverty - a proposal for an EU Action Plan [       COM(2004) 89      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The Communication establishes policy priorities for addressing the six main challenges facing commodity dependent developing countries (CDDCs):      treating commodity chains and dependence as priority issues in combating poverty;       remedying the long-term decline in prices;       managing commodity risks and providing access to financing;       diversifying production to include non-traditional commodities;       promoting integration in the international trading system;       encouraging the use of viable business and investment practices in the CDDCs.      The Communication focuses on agricultural (not mineral) commodities traded and marketed internationally, since these products are directly linked to poverty.     It does not cover timber as the Commission has already drawn up a strategy and provided a specific budget line for this product. The Commission has also implemented an       action plan to combat illegal logging      .      Treating commodity chains and dependence as priority issues in combating poverty      Commodity chains have a major impact on the poorest sections of the population and should be treated as a priority in development strategies and combating poverty.     To this end, the Commission proposes:      helping the CDDCs develop national commodity strategies as part of the fight against poverty;       enhancing the strategies developed in international commodity bodies for each commodity category.       Remedying the long-term decline in prices      As demand for commodities has been outstripped by the increase in supply on the world market, there has been a long-term decline in commodity prices.     To address this problem, the Commission proposes:      encouraging implementation of commodity chain strategies in the CDDCs, particularly in terms of improving capacity and support services at producer level, establishing basic infrastructure in production regions and pursuing policy reforms at macroeconomic level;       setting up support services at regional level to promote regional cooperation among farmers' networks, regulatory bodies, research institutions, the services responsible for infrastructure, etc.;       supporting regional integration by concluding economic partnership agreements with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries.       Managing commodity risks and providing access to financing      There is high price volatility on the agricultural commodities markets, and this creates uncertainty and affects the willingness and capacity of farmers to invest.     To address this phenomenon the Commission proposes:      improving producer access to commodity risk insurance and trade finance;       encouraging the development of shock management tools for the macroeconomic level;       improving the CDDCs' access to the Flex compensatory mechanism. Flex is an EU instrument that allows the countries concerned to compensate for sudden declines in export earnings.       Support for diversification      Expanding the markets for both inputs and output products would reduce investment risks.     To achieve this the Commission proposes:      offering CDDC governments technical assistance with policy choices concerning diversification;       providing more support for implementation of diversification and growth strategies;       supporting the preparation and implementation of a growth-focused strategy allowing products traded at national level to be developed; such a strategy would include abandoning unprofitable commodities;       increasing aid to the private sector, drawing on the available instruments for private sector development in non-traditional sectors.       Promoting integration in the international trading system      International trade rules are important for the CDDCs and commodity producers. Rules on domestic support, export competition and market access all shape commodity producers' opportunities, as do measures and standards and other technical regulations.     The Commission therefore proposes:      working to achieve a substantial and development-friendly outcome from the current negotiations under the         Doha Development Agenda        ;       pursuing reform of its agricultural polices so as to reduce trade distortions as much as possible and monitoring the impact of national aid policies;       facilitating CDDC access to the EU market, in particular by revising the generalised preference system;       supporting CDDC efforts to profit from their market access, in particular by enhancing helpdesk services.       Encouraging the use of viable business and investment practices in the CDDCs.      The international commodity companies and retailers play a central role in framing the future of the commodity sectors since local entrepreneurs are often unable to compete effectively with these large consolidated corporations whilst remaining independent. Their dependence on the corporate policies of multinational enterprises means that they need to improve their social and environmental practice.     The Commission therefore proposes:      fostering social responsibility at international level by promoting the application of viable codes of conduct, supporting the pooling of experience and studying criteria for the establishment of voluntary fair and ethical trading schemes at Community level;       supporting CDDCs' efforts to benefit from companies' social responsibility and setting up public-private partnerships in some countries to evaluate the experience gained;       promoting competition by drawing up common guidelines within the WTO, in particular in the context of regional cooperation.       Background      The prices of some important agricultural commodities (for example, sugar, cotton, coffee and cocoa) fell by 30 to 60% between 1970 and 2000. This has led to macroeconomic imbalances in the developing countries concerned, reducing export earnings, debt repayment capacity, imports, credit availability, government revenue and the provision of basic services (health care and education).     There are about fifty highly commodity dependent developing countries (with export revenues based on a maximum of three commodities). They are located mainly in Sub-Saharan Africa, but also in the Caribbean and Central America. They are mainly least developed countries (LDCs), landlocked countries or islands.     Many of these countries are caught in a trap of declining income and investment, stagnating competitiveness, endemic poverty and dependence. A lack of resources means that their commodities sectors are finding it ever harder to take on international competition, handle change and deal with the situation facing them.     RELATED ACTS      Commission communication of 12 February 2004 to the Council and Parliament: Proposal for an EU-Africa partnership in support of cotton-sector development [         COM(2004) 87        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      Concerned about the crisis in the cotton sector in African ACP countries - as highlighted at the WTO ministerial conference in Cancún - the Commission proposes, as part of its action plan for agricultural commodities, a partnership in the cotton sector centred on two series of measures. The first set of measures is designed to achieve more equitable commercial conditions on international cotton markets by giving priority to market access, the reduction of internal support, support for exports and trade-related technical assistance. The second concerns support for African regions and countries producing cotton, and comprise measures intended to consolidate the competitiveness of the African cotton sector, help the regions dependent on this product to diversify, and mitigate the effects of price volatility. The Commission stresses the importance of dialogue with the African countries concerned and identifies the financial instruments that can be used to support this partnership.

Ecodesign requirements   This regulation defines  ecodesign  requirements in 6 progressive stages (the last remaining stage will apply from 2018) each representing a gradual increase in the targets and/or extending the scope of the requirements to new sub-categories of products. These requirements concern:    lamps  — they must meet efficacy, performance and information requirements. Different types of lamps must reach a certain luminous efficacy in each wattage category, and meet lamp life and lamp lumen maintenance requirements. Manufacturers must also provide information on number of elements including:   the wattage (the amount of energy required to light a bulb);   lamp lumen (the amount of light produced by a bulb);   efficacy;   maintenance factor;   mercury content; and   colour temperature of the lamps.      ballasts  — they must meet energy performance and information requirements. When the lamps are switched on, the ballasts must comply with minimum efficacy thresholds. Manufacturers of ballasts must provide information on the energy efficiency index of products.    luminaires  — they must meet energy performance, compatibility and information requirements. The power consumption of luminaires must not exceed that of the incorporated ballasts when they do not emit any light. Manufacturers of luminaires must provide information on the efficiency of all ballasts and lamps sold with a luminaire, as well as maintenance and disassembly instructions.    Conformity   Manufacturers or their representatives are required to carry out a conformity assessment before placing an energy-using product on the market.   Verification procedures for market surveillance purposes   National authorities of EU countries must apply market surveillance procedures regarding:    lamps  — tests are carried out on a sample batch of a minimum of 20 lamps of the same model from the same manufacturer. The average results must not vary from the limit, threshold or declared values by more than 10 %;    ballasts and luminaires  — tests are carried on 1 single unit. The results obtained must not exceed the limit values. Otherwise, 3 more units must be tested.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 13 April 2009.   background   For more information, see:    ‘Lighting’  on the European Commission's website.   * key terms     Fluorescent lamps without integrated ballast:  discharge lamps of the low-pressure mercury type in which most of the light is emitted through the excitement of the molecules of one or more layers of phosphors by ultraviolet radiation from the discharge. They may be single- or double-capped and are without integrated ballast.     High intensity discharge lamps:  lamps in which the light is produced, directly or indirectly, by an electric discharge through a gas, a metal vapour or a mixture of several gases and vapours, and in which the light-producing arc is stabilised by wall temperature and the arc has a bulb wall loading in excess of 3 watts per square centimetre.     Ballasts:  devices which serve mainly to limit the current of the lamp(s) to the required value.     Luminaires:  pieces of apparatus which distribute, filter or transform the light transmitted from one or more light sources and which include all the parts necessary for supporting, fixing and protecting the light sources.
act    Directive 2014/34/EU  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres (recast).   summary    what does this directive do  The ATEX directive lays down uniform, EU-wide rules on the sale and putting into service of equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres. It seeks to ensure that products fulfil certain requirements to ensure a high level of protection of the health and safety of persons, especially workers, and, where appropriate, the protection of domestic animals and property. It applies to a wide range of products, including equipment used on fixed offshore oil and gas platforms, in petrochemical plants, mines, flour mills (airborne flour particles are highly flammable) and other areas where a potentially explosive atmosphere may be present.   key points   The directive defines the responsibilities of manufacturers, importers and distributors in the context of the sale of equipment and protective systems for use in potentially explosive atmospheres.   All products on sale in the EU must bear the  CE conformity marking  to show that they meet all the essential safety requirements of EU legislation.   Before obtaining the CE marking, the manufacturer must conduct a safety and conformity assessment and establish technical documentation for products.   Importers must check that manufacturers have carried out conformity assessments correctly. Where this is not the case, they must inform the safety monitoring authority.   All necessary documentation must be recorded and kept for 10 years.   Documentation and safety information must be written in a language easily understood by end -users.   Manufacturers and importers must indicate their postal address on their products.   Manufacturers may use electronic means to provide the safety monitoring authorities with the information that is necessary to demonstrate a product’s conformity.   In addition, the directive specifies the steps to be taken by national authorities that monitor safety to identify and prevent the import of dangerous products from non-EU countries.   when does the directive apply  From 20 April 2016. It repeals Directive  94/9/EC  with effect from 20 April 2016.   background   The directive updates EU rules on the sale of equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres. This is part of the effort to modernise European law in a wide variety of industrial sectors so as to simplify the rules, reduce administrative burdens and establish clearer and more consistent rules.

   Towards a new financial framework 2007-2013     Towards a new financial framework 2007-2013     The European Commission is presenting its proposals for the next financial framework of the European Union, which will set out the objectives and budgetary resources for the European Union for the period 2007-2013. According to this framework, EU activity should be concentrated primarily on the objectives of competitiveness and cohesion, sustainable development, European citizenship and the EU's external policy. Other topics that feature in the two communications of 10 February and 14 July 2004 include matching resources to objectives, instruments and good governance, and the financing system.     ACTS     Commission communication of 10 February 2004 "Building our common future - Policy challenges and budgetary means of the enlarged Union 2007-2013" [       COM(2004) 101      final - Not published in the Official Journal]     Commission communication of 14 July 2004 to the Council and the European Parliament "Financial Perspectives 2007 - 2013" [       COM(2004) 487      - Not published in the Official Journal]     SUMMARY     The first Commission communication launches the debate on the objectives and budgetary resources for the European Union for the period 2007-2013. This is the fourth       financial perspective      , following Delors I (1988-1992), Delors II (1993-1999) and       Agenda 2000      (2000-2006), as part of which a new       interinstitutional agreement      was adopted in 1999.     The second communication proposes a set of detailed measures and is accompanied by relevant legislative proposals that are to be negotiated by the Council and the European Parliament. The Commission welcomes the political consensus on the areas of action set out in February's communication, such as employment, sustainable development, security and an effective world role for the EU, and calls for funding the actions in order to realise these goals. At the request of the European Council in June 2004, the Commission has analysed the added value of its proposals and considered that it is demonstrated on the basis of three criteria:      effectiveness: in certain cases, EU action is the only way to get results;       efficiency: the EU offers better value for money;       synergy: EU action stimulates, complements and launches measures.      The document then goes on to develop proposals under each heading.     The number of headings in the financial perspective (i.e. major categories of expenditure) has been reduced from eight to five. This should make the system less rigid and allow resources to be used more efficiently. These headings, for which EUR 1 025 billion will be provided in commitment appropriations between 2007 and 2013, are as follows:      Sustainable development. This is divided into two components:- competitiveness for growth and employment;- cohesion for growth and employment;       Sustainable management and protection of natural resources;       Citizenship, freedom, security and justice;       The European Union as a global partner: this heading covers all external action, including the pre-accession instruments, the incorporation of the European Development Fund (EDF) in the EU budget, and the current reserves earmarked for emergency aid and loan guarantees;       Administration: this covers the expenditure of institutions other than the Commission, pensions and the European Schools. A new feature is that the Commission's administrative expenditure is included directly under the corresponding operational headings and not under this one.      Payment appropriations in the same period will amount to approximately EUR 929 billion.     The Commission also suggests that from 2013 onwards the financial perspective should be established for a period of five years, which would fit in better with the institutional timetable (both the Commission and the Parliament have a five-year term).     The Commission also calls for the       Solidarity Fund      to be integrated into the financial framework (under Heading 3: citizenship, freedom, security and justice).     There is an emphasis on flexibility, to be promoted via three specific mechanisms:     - the procedure for revising expenditure ceilings (which already exists in the current framework);     - a new reallocation flexibility to enable the budgetary authority to reallocate appropriations, within certain limits, between expenditure headings;     - a growth adjustment fund (to be included under the heading for sustainable development) which would make it possible to adjust expenditure more quickly to any changes in the implementation of the roadmap for sustainable development. A sum of EUR 1 billion would be allocated to this fund, which could be supplemented by any funds from the two cohesion instruments that remained unused after two years, up to a maximum of a further EUR 1 billion.      Priorities for the financial framework 2007-2013      In view of the mediocre performance of Europe's economies in recent years, the Commission proposes that the European Union concentrate its efforts on three main priorities:      Promoting sustainable development. This means completing the internal market and mobilising the various policies (economic, social and environmental) to that end. The objectives of competitiveness, cohesion and the protection and management of natural resources also fall under this heading;       Giving meaning to the concept of European citizenship by completing the area of freedom, justice and security and ensuring access to basic public goods and services;       Promoting a coherent role for Europe as a global partner.      On the subject of       sustainable development      , the Commission points out that competitiveness and cohesion are mutually reinforcing. To achieve such development, the European Union must become a dynamic, knowledge-based, growth-oriented economy. There must be greater cohesion, a more competitive agricultural sector, stronger rural development, more sustainable use of fish stocks and environmental protection.     The       competitiveness for growth and employment      component, with a budget of EUR 133 billion, comprises the following objectives:      Promoting the competitiveness of firms within a fully integrated single market, and particularly industrial competitiveness, entrepreneurship, the growth of small businesses, the innovative potential, innovation, investment in information technology for public services, eco-efficient technologies;       Stepping up and improving European research and technological development in order to create a European research area and to achieve the target of bringing public investment in research up to 1% of GDP: Financial aid for independent researchers, partnerships, networking between laboratories and the coordination of programmes and policies are all essential elements. Priority sectors are space and security;       Connecting Europe through EU networks: The cost of congestion is put at 1% of GDP, and improved connections could potentially add 0.23% to GDP. The cost of the whole trans-European network is estimated at EUR 600 billion. A list of 26 priority projects has been drawn up for the period up to 2020, at a cost of EUR 220 billion. Funding will peak in the period 2007-2013;       Improving the standard of education and training, particularly by placing the emphasis on mobility: The aim is for 3 million university students to benefit from this up to 2010, for 150 000 vocational trainees to take part in mobility schemes each year by 2013, for 10% of the school population to be involved in mobility schemes over the course of the programme and for 50 000 adults to take part in lifelong learning schemes;       Achieving the social policy agenda: This agenda, an integral part of the Lisbon strategy, combines legislation, the open method of coordination and social dialogue.      In order to achieve these objectives, the Commission proposes the creation of a single framework programme for competitiveness and innovation in the single market. The areas of research and technological development on the one hand, and sustainable development of the trans-European transport and energy networks on the other, will both be subject to separate instruments. In the field of education and training, a single programme will replace the current ones, with the emphasis on mobility. Other suggestions put forward by the Commission are managing changes with social consequences through the "Progress" programme.      Greater cohesion for growth and employment      , the second component of Heading 1, with a budget of approximately EUR 339 billion between 2007 and 2013, focuses on three priorities:      convergence: efforts must be concentrated on the least-developed Member States and regions;       regional competitiveness and employment: this objective mainly targets the Member States and regions not affected by convergence, given that there will continue to be significant needs;       European territorial cooperation through cross-border and transnational programmes.      The Commission also suggests reinforcing the elements that contribute to the added value of cohesion policy: concentrating resources on investment, complying with the rules on the single market, placing the emphasis on job creation in new areas, contributing to partnership and good governance, and the leverage effect (as a result of co-financing rules that mobilise additional resources for new investment from national public and private resources).     The heading       sustainable management and protection of natural resources      is to receive a total of EUR 405 billion for the period 2007-2013, of which 72% for agriculture (EUR 301 billion). Most of the expenditure for this heading stems from the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), rural development policy after 2006 and from the new common fisheries policy (January 2003) for which the Commission proposes a simplification of the financial arrangements and structures. Environmental matters are also of great importance and the Commission suggests increasing funding in this area and developing an instrument which would allow strictly environmental measures to be taken ("Life+").     In Heading 2,       Conservation and Management of Natural Resources      , the key actions are the common agricultural policy (CAP), rural development policy and fisheries policy. The Commission proposes simplifying the financing arrangements and structures of these policies. The environment is also a key concern and the Commission suggests providing more funding of environmental action and establishing a single instrument to unify strictly environmental measures ("Life+").     The share of the heading       citizenship, freedom, security and justice      in the financial perspective will increase over the years and amount to EUR 25 billion over the period as a whole.     This heading proposes reinforcing the EU as an area of freedom, security and justice through a simplified structure based on three framework programmes ("Freedom of movement and solidarity in the area of external borders, asylum and immigration", "Security" and "Justice and fundamental rights") which would replace all the existing instruments. Management of the funds would be largely shared with the Member States. In the first framework programme, the Commission proposes the creation of an Agency for External Borders and expects Europol, Eurojust and the European Police College to become EU bodies.     This heading also proposes actions and programmes to ensure access to basic goods and services and to foster European culture and diversity, and the creation of a solidarity and rapid reaction instrument.     For the area of freedom, security and justice, the Commission proposes the creation of a European Border Agency and a European Border Guard Corps, a common asylum policy and a common immigration policy. In the interests of security, the priority will be to strengthen Europol and the European Police College. Measures are needed to ensure access to justice and close cooperation between the judicial authorities, as well as common approaches to fighting crime.     Under the heading       the European Union as a global partner      , the emphasis will be placed on the need for the EU to achieve a level of political influence commensurate with its economic influence, so that, in its region and beyond, the EU can be active not only in economic and political areas but also in promoting stability, conflict prevention and crisis management. As a partner in sustainable development, the EU must fight poverty, pursue the millennium development goals set by the United Nations and promote common positions that will give coherence to multilateral negotiations. As a global player, it must work for effective multilateralism and contribute to security in the region. There must also be greater coherence in bilateral relations and international institutions by establishing a single policy framework and unique programming for each partner country and each thematic policy, as well as a common development policy. A total of EUR 95 billion is allocated to this heading.     For this heading, the Commission proposes a drastic simplification of instruments, based on coherence and the importance of the results in relation to the attribution of resources. In the new architecture proposed, three instruments directly support European external policies: the Pre-Accession Policy (IPA), the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument and the Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation Instrument, which will be the main means of cooperation with other non-EU countries not covered by the first two instruments.     With a view to responding to crises and to certain regional or international problems, the Commission proposes three further instruments: the Humanitarian Aid Instrument, the Macro-Financial Assistance (MFA) Instrument and the Instrument for Stability. The Instrument for Stability would also be used to address trans-border challenges such as the fight against terrorism and trafficking, to promote nuclear safety, to provide electoral assistance and to develop the peace-keeping capacity.

The amounts in headings 3 and 4 include expenditure for the Solidarity Fund (EUR 961 million at 2004 prices) and the EDF (estimated as EUR 3 billion) respectively.     (a) Including expenditure for the Solidarity Fund (EUR 961 million at 2004 prices) from 2006. However, the corresponding payments are calculated only from 2007.     (b) The integration of the EDF in the EU budget should take effect in 2008. The commitments for 2006 and 2007 are included for the sake of comparison only. Payments for commitments before 2008 are not taken into account in the payment amounts.     (c) Including the administrative expenditure of institutions other than the Commission, pensions and the European Schools. The Commission's administrative expenditure is included in the first four expenditure headings.     (d) Amounts provided for in the European Union's common position with a view to the Accession Conference with Bulgaria (CONF-BG-27/04).      Matching resources to objectives      The communication also explains the budgetary constraints, and in particular the commitments already entered into which cannot be ignored, such as direct aid to agriculture (fixed until 2013), cohesion policy for the enlarged EU, future enlargement to include Romania and Bulgaria, and the Lisbon and Göteborg strategies. It will be impossible to meet all these commitments if the budgetary resources are less than in the current period. The commitment appropriations ceiling will account for 1.11% of the EU's gross national income (GNI) in 2006. Including the commitments under the 9th EDF would add, on average, another 0.03 % of GNI, but a ceiling of around 1% of GNI would not be sufficient and would require compromises to be made.     The Commission believes that the significance of the challenges identified justifies an increase in the budget but that a credible plan to meet the Union's needs can be drawn up within an overall own resources ceiling of 1.24% of GNI.     Financial transfers will continue to be capped at 4% of GNI of the State concerned for cohesion policy, and the amounts transferred to the new rural development and fisheries instruments are still included in the calculation.      Instruments and governance      The success of policies relies on the efficiency of delivery instruments. The Commission accordingly reiterates the guiding principles of the proper apportionment of tasks: concentration of resources, consistency between goals, and partnership with all the actors involved.     A crucial feature of the communication is the simplification of instruments by means of a roadmap that brings together goals, objectives, instruments, indicators and a stringent timetable. Simplification will take account of consistency, the political dimension of the project and the principle of proportionality. The Commission thus proposes applying a single instrument per policy area (a single fund per programme) and examining alternatives to in-house direct management. Annex 1 to the document contains an overall approach to administrative governance.      The financing system      The structure of own resources and the correction of budgetary imbalances are dealt with in this section.     As regards the system of own resources, the Commission acknowledges the criticism about its complexity and lack of transparency, but stresses its successful performance in financial terms, given that the system has achieved its primary aim of ensuring the stability of resources. In its view, a visible tax resource payable by EU citizens and/or economic operators could partly replace the GNI contributions. It sets out three possibilities for the future, even though the Commission was not supposed to propose a new own resource as part of the financial perspective for 2007-2013:      a tax on corporate income;       a genuine VAT resource;       an energy tax.      The Commission also makes it clear that the tax burden for citizens would not increase.     To correct budgetary imbalances, the Commission suggests a generalised correction mechanism to correct net contributions in excess of a certain pre-defined threshold of adequate "financial solidarity", defined as a percentage of gross national income, in line with the relative prosperity of the Member States.     RELATED ACTS      Commission working document of 14 July 2004, "Proposal for renewal of the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure" [         COM(2004) 498        final - Not published in the Official Journal]      This working document is intended to serve as a basis for the negotiations between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission aimed at drawing up common rules for the management of the multiannual financial framework and the annual budgetary procedure. It proposes that the existing basic principles of budgetary discipline be retained, in particular the structure of the financial framework divided into broad categories of expenditure ("headings"), the definition of maximum amounts ("ceilings") for commitment appropriations in each heading and the setting of an annual ceiling on payment appropriations.     Drawing on the experience acquired with previous financial frameworks, the Commission is also suggesting adjustments regarding flexibility, transparency and interinstitutional collaboration, e.g. the integration into the financial framework of the European Development Fund and the Solidarity and Rapid Reaction Fund, two instruments which, although managed at European Union level, currently fall outside Agenda 2000.

   Croatia – Research and new technologies     Croatia – Research and new technologies     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM (2010) 660      final – SEC(2010) 1326 - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Although the country has made progress, the       2010 Report      highlights the delays caused by the economic and financial crisis. However, the significance of the research and development of new technologies remains a major challenge. Administrative capacity and investment must also be increased, in particular with support for enterprises.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission's words)      Due to its specificity, the       acquis      in the field of       science and research      does not require any transposition in the national legal order. Implementation capacity does not relate to the application and enforcement of legal provisions but rather to the existence of the necessary conditions for effective participation in framework programmes. In order to ensure the successful implementation of the       acquis      in this domain, notably successful association to the Framework Programmes, Croatia will need to create the necessary implementing capacities in the field of research and technological development including an increase of the personnel related to Framework Programme activities.     The       acquis      in the field of       telecommunications      is aimed at the elimination of obstacles to the effective operation of the single market in telecommunications services and networks, and the deployment of universally-available modern services. A new regulatory framework on electronic communications was adopted by the European Union (EU) in 2002. As regards postal services, the objective is to implement the single market by opening up the sector to competition in a gradual and controlled way, within a regulatory framework which assures a universal service.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission's words)      Progress in       science and research      has continued, but has slowed down as a result of the economic and financial crisis.     Efforts are needed to further strengthen research capacity, provide training, and increase       investment      in research by industry and small and medium enterprises.     RELATED ACTS      Commission Report [         COM(2009) 533        final – SEC(2009) 1333 final – Not published in the Official Journal].       Commission Report [         COM(2008) 674        final – SEC(2008) 2694 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2008 report noted satisfactory progress made in the field of science and research. However, research capacity had to be reinforced at national level. As regards the information society, alignment of legislation had made significant progress.      Commission Report [         COM(2007) 663        final – SEC(2007) 1431 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2007 report emphasised the encouraging efforts made in the field of science and research. In general, a good level of alignment had been achieved. However, greater attention had to be paid to the implementation of research policy and the action and plans envisaged in this area. The system for the allocation of national funds for research grants was to be improved in order to guarantee scientific excellence and participation in Community framework programmes on a competitive basis.     In the field of the information society and media, despite the progress achieved in aligning with the       acquis      , the 2007 report emphasised the need to go further in terms of the liberalisation of the telecommunications market. In this respect, it recommended a renewal of primary legislation and the strengthening of the Croatian Telecommunications Agency.      Commission Report [         COM(2006) 649        final – SEC(2006) 1385 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2006 report confirmed the advances outlined in October 2005. Progress had been made in the two areas of transposing the       acquis      and identifying gaps still to be bridged.     As regards the information society and media, increased efforts were needed to achieve effective liberalisation of the electronic communications market both in terms of legislation and strengthening of the Telecommunications Agency.     As regards science and research, major advances had been made on participation in EU programmes and the allocation of appropriations. Nevertheless, continued efforts were required on budgetary provisions, research facilities, capacity building of human resources, and public funding.      Commission Report [         COM(2005) 561        final – SEC(2005) 1424 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The October 2005 Report noted that Croatia had made good progress in aligning its national legislation with the       acquis      in the field of electronic communications. However, implementation of this legislation was only in the very early stages and had to be accelerated in view of the low level of competition on the market. In the area of research, progress had been made in preparing for participation in the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP6).      Commission Opinion [         COM(2004) 257        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      In its Opinion of April 2004, the Commission stressed that Croatia must continue to make sustained efforts to align its legislation with the       acquis      on telecommunications. The report showed in particular that in order to implement the       acquis      in this area, the Croatian Government would have to give considerable political support to the liberalisation policies. On the subject of research, the report emphasised that continued efforts should be made to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of research in Croatia and to prepare for the country’s participation in Community framework programmes.

   Joint report on social inclusion     Joint report on social inclusion     As part of the Lisbon objective, which is to facilitate the eradication of poverty by 2010, the implementation of ambitious and effective policies on social inclusion is a priority for the European Union. The Member States firmly believe that economic modernisation must go hand in hand with promoting social cohesion and, in particular, with an open method of coordination designed to prevent and eradicate poverty and social exclusion. To this end, the new generation of national action plans for social inclusion aims to examine and strengthen the policies and strategies put in place at national level to promote the fight against poverty and social exclusion.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 12 December 2003 concerning the joint report on social inclusion summarising the results of the examination of the National Action Plans for Social Inclusion (2003-2005) [       COM(2003)773      - Not published in the official journal].     SUMMARY     In order to encourage more ambitious and effective strategies to promote social inclusion, the report sets out the main trends and challenges associated with policies to combat poverty and social inclusion within the European Union. It also highlights the progress achieved in implementing the open method of coordination between the Member States and outlines the main priorities for action. This report served as the basis for the joint report by the Council and the Commission, which was adopted in March 2004.      SOCIAL INCLUSION - SITUATION IN THE EUROPEAN UNION       Overview      The action taken by the European Union to promote social inclusion must be examined in light of the overall economic downturn which Europe has suffered for the past few years. This development, which has been associated with a slowdown in employment growth and an increase in unemployment, has hampered, but not stopped, the European Union in its efforts to achieve       the employment objectives set out in Lisbon and Stockholm      .     The years immediately preceding the introduction of the new social inclusion strategy have seen a reduction in relative poverty, which fell from 17% in 1995 to 15% in 2001. In all countries, the poverty threshold has risen faster than the rate of inflation, implying an increase in the overall level of prosperity. Between 1998 and 2001, the risk of poverty also fell across the board.     The present report nevertheless points out that, in 2001, more than 55 million people were still facing the risk of poverty, i.e. 15% of the European population. The groups most at risk were the unemployed, single parents, elderly people living alone and families with a large number of children.     The risk of poverty varies widely from one country to another, from 10% in Sweden to 21% in Ireland. In the countries in the south, and in the United Kingdom and Ireland, vulnerable members of the population generally benefit less from prosperity and are also more at risk from the most persistent forms of poverty and privation.     Moreover, long-term unemployment, which is closely linked to social exclusion, has a significant role to play. In 2002, it affected almost 3% of the working population (or 39% of the unemployed). With a few exceptions (Finland, Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom), it affects women more than men. Nevertheless, long-term unemployment has fallen steadily since 1995, when it reached its peak of 4.9%.     Although these statistics give cause for concern, significant progress has been made in the labour market. In 2002, the average employment rate within the European Union rose from 63.4% to 64.3%. Women benefited the most, with female employment increasing by more than 1% between 2001 and 2003 (from 54.1% to 55.6%). Moreover, the employment rate of elderly people rose significantly within the EU as a whole, except for Austria, Germany and Italy.      The six major priorities associated with the Lisbon objective      In an attempt to achieve the Lisbon objective, it is necessary to ensure that those facing the risk of poverty and social exclusion do not suffer disproportionately from the effects of the economic slowdown and the resulting budget restrictions. The Member States are therefore asked to attach the greatest possible importance to the following six policy priorities:      promoting investment in and tailoring of active labour market measures to meet the needs of those who have the greatest difficulties in accessing employment;       ensuring that social protection schemes are adequate and accessible for all and that they provide effective work incentives for those who can work;       improving access by those most at risk of social exclusion to proper housing and healthcare, and to education and lifelong learning;       making a concerted effort to prevent dropping out of school and promoting a smooth transition from school to the workplace;       focusing on the eradication of child poverty;       developing a dynamic policy to reduce poverty and social exclusion among immigrants and ethnic minorities.       National action plans for social inclusion 2003      The second generation of national action plans for social inclusion are based on a less optimistic view of the economic situation than their predecessors. The current economic slowdown could place people at greater risk of poverty and social exclusion. Moreover, those who are already affected are bound to suffer as a result of the overall increase in long-term unemployment and the fact that it is now more difficult to find work.     If the fight against poverty and social exclusion is to be properly coordinated and effective, the Member States must make it part of their economic, social and employment policies.     Against this background, the eight major challenges identified in the first joint report continue to be the following:      developing an inclusive labour market and promoting employment as a right and opportunity for all;       guaranteeing an adequate income and resources to live with dignity;       tackling educational disadvantage by prevention and lifelong learning opportunities;       preserving family solidarity while promoting gender equality and protecting the individual rights and benefits of family members and the rights of the child;       proper accommodation for all;       guaranteeing equal access to quality services;       improving public services so that they meet local and individual needs;       regenerating areas of multiple hardship.      Each national action plan for social inclusion is based on very different considerations, depending on the approach and priorities of the Member State which drew it up. However, irrespective of the country concerned, the national action plan for social inclusion has to meet three basic criteria:      exhaustive and multidimensional approachWherever possible, the national action plans for social inclusion must implement actions and policies in the different areas which affect the public. This multidimensional approach is evident in the national action plans drawn up by Belgium, France, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Portugal and Greece.       coherent and planned approachThe national action plans for social inclusion must be based on an in-depth analysis of the situation and must define clear and specific objectives. On the whole, the plans drawn up in 2003 were more coherent than their predecessors. A number of Member States, particularly the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries, stand out because of the strategic and logical vision reflected in their plans.       definition of objectivesThe plans must set precise targets for eradicating poverty and social exclusion by 2010. In general, three tendencies are evident from the plans drawn up by the Member States:      - direct outcome targets: aimed directly at reducing poverty and social exclusion in a key policy area;     - intermediate outcome targets: contribute indirectly to reducing poverty and social exclusion;     - input targets: improve policy effort in a particular area.     Greece, Spain, Ireland and Portugal are among the small number of Member States which have really established clear overall targets. In general, the approach is less systematic and focuses on problems of employment and unemployment. Few Member States take account of the male-female dimension.

Strategy based on:      - a strategy to combat poverty and social exclusion involving a large number of people;     - high quality public services;     - particularly disadvantaged groups;     - the eradication of child poverty by 2020;     - promoting access to the employment market and to skilled work;     - high and stable employment levels.      CONTEXT      The Lisbon European Council of March 2000 asked the Member States and the Commission to take ambitious and effective measures by 2010 to eradicate poverty. It was also suggested that they should coordinate their policies to combat poverty and social exclusion in order to pool their objectives, indicators and national action plans.     In December 2000, the Nice European Council decided to launch a new method of combating poverty and social exclusion, based on four objectives:      promoting participation in employment and access by all to resources, rights, goods and services;       preventing the risks of exclusion;       action to help the most vulnerable;       mobilising all relevant bodies.      In this context,       the national action plans for social inclusion      , which were submitted in June 2001, aimed to translate the common objectives into national policies, while taking account of the situation in each Member State, and the different national systems of social protection.     The national action plans for social inclusion were examined in depth by the European Commission and the Member States in the joint report on social inclusion approved by the Laeken European Council in December 2001.     In December 2002, the European Council asked the Member States to prepare a second set of national action plans for social inclusion for July 2003.     RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission of 10 October 2001 concerning the draft joint report on social inclusion (2000-2002) [         COM(2001) 565        - Not published in the Official Journal]       Commission staff working paper. Social inclusion in the new Member States. A synthesis of the joint memoranda on social inclusion [SEC(2004) 848].      The Gothenburg European Council asked the new Member States to transpose into their national policies the social, environmental and economic objectives of the European Union.     Against this background, the Joint Inclusion Memoranda (JIM) reflect the political commitment of the new Member States to attach greater importance to combating poverty and social exclusion.     Social exclusion is a thorny problem in most of the new Member States and is largely the result of their readjustment to a market economy. This profound change resulted in a severe fall in production and a significant increase in the unemployment rate, particularly in the Baltic States, Poland and Slovakia.     In absolute terms, the risk of poverty in the new Member States is comparable with that in the old Member States. However, salary levels in the new Member States are much lower and people living below the poverty level experience living conditions which are significantly worse than those in the other countries in the EU.     The worrying levels of poverty highlighted in the Joint Inclusion Memoranda prove that the need for action is urgent. In this regard, six main challenges have been identified:      expand employment market policies in order to improve the integration of those groups who are most at risk;       ensure that social security systems guarantee an adequate minimum wage which enables everyone to live with dignity;       increase the opportunities available in the fields of education and lifelong learning, particularly for those at risk of poverty and social exclusion;       improve the quality of public services;       step up efforts to combat very high levels of exclusion and discrimination against certain ethnic groups, such as the Roma, and other very vulnerable groups;       strengthen policies to support the family and social assistance networks and reinforce the protection of children's rights.

   Cooperation with industrialised countries (2001-2006)     Cooperation with industrialised countries (2001-2006)     The European Community pursues cooperation and trade relations with the industrialised countries       *      of North America, the Far East and Australasia.     ACT     Council Regulation (EC) No       382/2001      of 26 February 2001 concerning the implementation of projects promoting cooperation and commercial relations between the European Union and the industrialised countries of North America, the Far East and Australasia and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1035/1999 [       See amending acts      ].     Repealed by Council Regulation (EC) No       1934/2006      of 21 December 2006 establishing a financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high-income countries and territories [Official Journal L 405 of 30.12.2006].     SUMMARY     On the basis of Articles 133 and 308 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Community implements actions to promote cooperation and trade with the industrialised countries of North America, the Far East and Australasia.     This regulation provides a legal framework for engaging in such cooperative actions. It also comes under the bilateral relations already established with:       The United States of America        : these relations are based on the         1990 Transatlantic Declaration        , the         1995 New Transatlantic Agenda        , the         1998 Transatlantic Economic Partnership        and the 1999 Bonn Declaration;        Canada        : these relations are based on the 1976 Framework Agreement for commercial and economic cooperation, the 1990 Declaration on EC-Canada Relations, the 1996 Joint Action Plan and Joint Political Declaration, and the Ottawa Summit partnership agenda adopted on 18 March 2004;        Japan        : these relations are based on the 1991 Joint Declaration and the 2001 EU-Japan Action Plan;        The Republic of Korea        : these relations are based on the Framework Agreement on trade and cooperation, which entered into force in 2001;        Australia        : these relations are based on the 1997 Joint Declaration, revised in 2003;        New Zealand        : these relations are based on the 1999 Joint Declaration, revised in 2004.      This regulation aims to promote cooperation under the various bilateral instruments between the EU and the partner countries by creating a more favourable climate for the conduct and further development of these relations.     Financing will cover in particular the following activities:      education and information of the public about the bilateral relations;       strengthening cultural, academic and people-to-people links;       promotion of the dialogue between political, economic and social partners;       research work and studies destined to provide input to the Commission's work;       cooperative projects in science and technology, energy, transport and environmental matters;       enhancing customs cooperation;       enhancing the visibility of the EU in the partner countries;       pilot schemes, which could subsequently lead to new activities to be financed.      The financing of cooperation projects will be provided entirely from the Community budget or will take the form of cofinancing with other sources in the partner countries and/or the EU.     Some projects directly concern individuals, in the fields of education and training for instance. Grants and study awards may be paid to natural persons in such cases.     With Japan, and to a lesser extent Korea, the Community will implement a specific programme of measures and actions to improve the Member States' commercial presence on the Japanese and Korean markets. The regulation provides for support for various actions, namely:      the participation of European commercial executives in actions carried out in Japan and in Korea (         executive training programmes involving Japan and Korea        );       the collection of information and policy advice on trade-related issues with Japan;       conferences and seminars to promote trade and investment;       recruitment, training, preparation of missions to facilitate access to the Japanese market by Community companies (Gateway to Japan).      The Commission will be assisted by a committee in implementing actions in the trade field.     The Commission will submit a bi-annual report on the implementation of the regulation to Parliament and the Council. The Commission will also evaluate the actions and programmes concerned in order to determine whether they have achieved their objectives.     The regulation will expire on 31 December 2007. It has been extended pending a new legal framework.       Key terms used in the act         Industrialised countries: the United States, Canada, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Australia, New Zealand.

   Non-state Actors and Local Authorities     Non-state Actors and Local Authorities     Under this thematic programme, the Commission is supporting the right of initiative of non-state actors and local authorities by funding their initiatives when geographical programmes are not the appropriate instrument and by supplementing the support that other sectoral thematic programmes can provide. The three main areas of intervention are: actions in developing countries and regions, awareness raising and education in Europe on the subject of development, and measures facilitating the coordination between civil society networks and local authorities.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - The Thematic Programme "Non-state Actors and Local Authorities in Development" [       COM(2006) 19      - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This programme succeeds both the       NGO co-financing      programmes and the       decentralised cooperation      programmes. By supporting the right of initiative of non-state actors and local authorities, it supplements the support provided by geographical and other sectoral thematic programmes, in particular the programme on democracy and human rights.     Ownership and participation are core principles of the European Union (EU) development policy as stated in the       European consensus      . This approach is also reflected in partnership and cooperation agreements, e.g. between the ACP countries and the EU and with Asia, South America and "neighbouring" countries.     The added value of associating various non-state actors lies in their independence from the State, their proximity to and understanding of defined constituencies, their capacity to articulate their specific interests and their ability to bridge a critical gap between strategic goals and their practical realisation.     This programme primarily targets interventions in the field. It is chiefly implemented in countries and regions where geographical programmes do not provide for any financial support for non-state actors or local authorities owing to weak political commitment, in subregions out of reach of the country programme or in situations of difficult partnerships, fragile States, post-conflict, political instability, etc.     All non-profit state actors from the EU and from partner countries can be eligible for funding under this programme. In addition, local authorities may receive financial support for activities in specific contexts where their added value can be established and where these activities cannot be carried out under geographical programmes. This actor-oriented approach will be refined in the multiannual thematic strategy paper.     Three types of action may be funded:      actions which strengthen participatory development, support capacity development processes for the actors concerned at country or regional level, and promote mutual understanding processes;       awareness raising and education for development in the EU and acceding countries;       coordination and communication between civil society and local authority networks, within their organisations and between different types of stakeholders active in the European public debate on development.      Interventions in all developing countries, as defined in the list of Official Development Assistance (ODA) recipients, can be eligible for funding under this thematic programme. These countries are covered by the European neighbourhood and partnership policy (ENPI) and the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI). The multiannual thematic strategy paper will set the eligibility criteria.     As regards programming, a four-year (2007-2010) and, subsequently, a three-year (2011-2013) thematic strategy paper will be decided by the Commission. These will define in more detail the criteria for selecting priority countries and regions, together with priorities for action. On the basis of this multiannual programming, the Commission will produce annual action programmes that establish priority actions, specific objectives and indicative amounts.      Objectives and priorities      The primary objective of this programme is the eradication of poverty in the context of sustainable development, including pursuit of the       Millennium Development Goals      (MDG). Other major objectives include good governance and human rights, which are cross-cutting issues to be mainstreamed in interventions in partner countries.     Our priorities include supporting stakeholder participation in unfavourable contexts (e.g. difficult partnerships, instability, conflict), promoting cross-border and regional initiatives, fostering quality partnerships between different stakeholders from the EU and partner countries, strengthening the capacity of employer and worker organisations, and fostering coherence as regards development in the area of education by giving children and young people access to education for development.

   State aid in short-term export-credit insurance     State aid in short-term export-credit insurance     The Commission aims to remove distortions of competition due to state aid in the short-term export-credit insurance sector where there is competition between public or publicly supported export-credit insurers and private export-credit insurers. This communication states that, as a general rule, marketable risks cannot be covered by export-credit insurance with the support of European Union (EU) countries.     ACT     Commission communication to the Member States pursuant to Article 88(1) of the Treaty applying Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty to short-term export-credit insurance (Text with EEA relevance) [       Official Journal C 281 of 17.09.1997      ].     Amended by:     Communication of the Commission to Member States amending the communication pursuant to Article 93(1) of the EC Treaty applying Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty to short-term export-credit insurance [       Official Journal C 325 of 22.12.2005      ].     Communication of the Commission amending the period of application of Communication of the Commission to the Member States pursuant to Article 93(1) of the EC Treaty applying Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty to short-term export-credit insurance [       Official Journal C 329 of 7.12.2010      ].     SUMMARY     In some European Union (EU) countries public or publicly supported export-credit agencies insure short-term export risks for the account or with the guarantee of the state by financing transactions in the EU and with a large number of non-EU countries.     From a competition viewpoint, the fact that these credit-insurance agencies enjoy certain financial advantages granted by the state enables them to offer better credit-insurance terms, and this may distort competition in relation to private insurers. This communication aims to remove distortions of competition due to state aid in the export-credit insurance sector.     This communication applies to state aid in the short-term export-credit insurance sector. It does not, however, deal with the insurance of medium and long-term export-credit risks, which are largely non-marketable at the present time.      Definition of "marketable" risks      Marketable risks are risks for which in principle a market exists, i.e. there is a private insurance capacity available to cover these risks. The definition of which risks are marketable may evolve over time.     At present, marketable risks are defined as commercial and political risks on public and non-public debtors established within the European Union and in certain of the       Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development      (OECD) member countries. They are linked to short-term export credits with a maximum risk period of less than two years. All other risks are excluded from the definition of marketable risks and from the scope of this communication. Despite this definition of marketable risks, if and to the extent that no private insurance market exists in the EU country, commercial and political risks incurred on public and non-public debtors established in the countries listed in the annex to this communication are considered to be temporarily non-marketable if incurred by small and medium-sized enterprises with a total annual export turnover not exceeding EUR 2 million.      Factors distorting competition and measures to be taken to restore the free interplay of competition on the market      The communication identifies the factors that may distort competition in favour of public export-credit insurers, including:      state guarantees enabling insurers to borrow at rates lower than the normal market rates or making it possible for them to borrow money at all;       any difference in the obligations on public insurers and private insurers as regards the maintenance of adequate provisions;       relief or exemption from taxes normally payable;       grants of aid or provisions of capital by the state.      In order to remove distortions of competition in this sector, EU countries are called on to eliminate the following types of state aid:      state guarantees for borrowing or losses;       exemption from the requirement to constitute adequate reserves;       relief or exemption from taxes or other charges normally payable;       the granting of aid, the provision of capital or the granting of other forms of finance in circumstances or on terms that a private investor acting under normal market conditions would not accept;       provision by the state of services in kind (such as access to and use of state infrastructure, facilities or privileged information) on terms not reflecting their cost;       reinsurance by the state on terms more favourable than those available from the market.      Exceptionally, where export-credit insurers are temporarily unable to cover marketable risks because of insufficient insurance or reinsurance capacity, those temporarily non-marketable risks may be covered by a public or publicly supported export credit insurer with the support of the state. In such cases, the insurer shall, as far as possible, align its premium rates for such risks with the rates charged elsewhere by private export-credit insurers for the type of risk in question. Any EU countries intending to use the escape clause must notify this to the Commission and wait for a Commission approval.     The agencies will, in addition, have to keep a separate administration and separate accounts for their insurance of marketable risks and non-marketable risks for the account and with the guarantee of the state.      Monitoring by the Commission      The Commission will monitor at all times national reinsurance schemes on the basis of six-monthly reports presented by EU countries. The communication will remain in force until 31 December 2012.      Background      In December 2008, as a consequence of the financial crisis, the Commission adopted the Temporary framework for State aid measures to support access to finance in the current financial and economic crisis ('       the Temporary Framework'      ), which introduced a temporary procedural simplification to point 4.4 of the 1997 communication, regarding the demonstration of the unavailability of cover for short-term export-credit. This procedural simplification will be valid till 31 December 2011.     Last updated: 14.06.2011  
   Plant protection products prohibited (until June 2011)     Plant protection products prohibited (until June 2011)     The European Union regulates the placing on the market and use of plant protection products and lists the prohibited active substances.     ACT     Council Directive       79/117/EEC      of 21 December 1978 prohibiting the placing on the market and use of plant protection products containing certain active substances [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     The purpose of this Directive is to prohibit the placing on the market and use of plant protection products       *      containing certain active substances       *      .     This Directive, and its subsequent amendments, include an annexed list of the active substances that may be neither placed on the market nor used. However, temporary derogations may be granted at national level for specific uses.     Active substances are included in the Annex if their use gives rise, or is likely to give rise, to harmful effects on human or animal health or to unacceptable adverse effects on the environment.     Where an unforeseeable danger threatens plant production and cannot be contained by other means, the Member State in question may permit the placing on the market and the use of the product for a maximum period of 120 days.     The Directive does not apply to plant protection products to be used for research or analysis, or exported to a third country.      Context      As of 14 June 2011, this Directive is repealed by Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 regarding the       placing of plant protection products on the market      .       Key terms used in the act         Plant protection products: active substances and preparations containing one or more active substances which do one or more of the following:         Active substances: substances or micro-organisms including viruses having general or specific action against harmful organisms or on plants, parts of plants or plant products.

summary of   Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1715 — rules for the functioning of the information management system for official controls and its system components (the IMSOC Regulation)   what is the aim of the regulation   The legal basis of the IMSOC Implementing Regulation derives from the  general food law  (Regulation (EC) No  178/2002  ), the  animal health law  (Regulation (EU)  2016/429  ), the  plant health law  (Regulation (EU)  2016/2031  ), and the  official controls regulation  (Regulation (EU)  2017/625  ).   The official controls regulation requires the  European Commission  , in collaboration with EU countries, to set up and manage a computerised information system for official controls (IMSOC)  *  to manage, handle and automatically exchange data, information and documents in relation to official controls.    The IMSOC is to integrate the 4 existing information systems managed by the Commission, namely:   the  rapid alert system for food and feed  (  RASFF  ) established by General Food law;   the animal diseases information system (  ADIS  )  *  to be established by the Animal Health Law;   the system for notifying and reporting the presence of pests (  EUROPHYT  )  *  to be established by the Plant Health Law; and   the  TRACES   *  system (referred to in the Official Controls Regulation).     The purpose of the IMSOC Regulation is:   to set out in the same act all rules on the functioning of the IMSOC and its 4components; and   to set out rules for the exchange of data, information and documents between IMSOC’s components and in certain cases, with other systems such as EU countries’ national systems, information systems of non-EU countries and international organisations.     key points   The regulation lays down the rules for the functioning of the IMSOC and its system components in relation to the computerised handling and exchange of information, data and documents necessary for the performance of official controls.   IMSOC components    the rapid alert system for food and feed (RASFF);   the computerised information system for the notification and reporting of animal diseases (ADIS);   the electronic system (EUROPHYT) for notifying outbreaks such as the presence of quarantine pests;   the computerised system for data, information and document exchange (TRACES).    Scope   The regulation’s scope covers official controls to verify compliance with food and feed law, animal health and welfare, plant health and animal-by products rules. It specifically covers:   procedures for notifications and additional information for the RASFF set up by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002;   procedures for the EU’s computerised system for reporting diseases under Regulation (EU) 2016/429;   rules for submitting notifications under Regulation (EU) 2016/2031;   rules for computerised data and document handling in the IMSOC necessary under Regulation (EU) 2017/625, concerning:   the common health entry document (  CHED  )  *  and instructions for its use;   cooperation between customs and other authorities;   electronic certificates and electronic signatures for official certificates;   standard formats for information exchange concerning requests for assistance and recurrent notifications;   technical tools and procedures for communication between the designated liaison bodies;   the proper functioning of the IMSOC.     Each component of the IMSOC has its own network of which the Commission is a part, with each network member being responsible for the data, information and documents it inserts or produces in the relevant component.   Database linkage   The following links between components aim to complement data, providing relevant and up-to-date information to each network member for the performance of its tasks:    iRASFF   *  and TRACES, allowing data sharing about border rejection notifications and common health entry documents;   EUROPHYT and TRACES, allowing data sharing about EUROPHYT outbreak and interception notifications;   iRASFF, EUROPHYT and TRACES, allowing data sharing about operators’ past records of compliance with the rules.    International standard file formats   Data exchanges between the IMSOC and other electronic systems, including the EU national systems, are based on international standards and use XML, CMS or PDF formats.   iRASFF   EU countries designate a liaison body responsible for exchanging information on food fraud notifications and appoint a single contact point for RASFF and Administrative Assistance and Cooperation (AAC) networks (that coordinates with the Food Fraud (FF) network).  RASFF, AAC and FF network contact points exchange notifications, requests and responses in iRASFF.  Single contact points submit in iRASFF alert notifications to the Commission contact point within 48 hours of the risk being reported to them or information notifications and news notifications without undue delay. They also submit border rejection notifications, non-compliance notifications and follow-up notifications to their counterparts in the network.  Food fraud notifications are exchanged using a dedicated IT tool by Food Fraud contact points, until they are integrated into iRASFF.   ADIS   Each ADIS network member can designate more than one contact point to submit notifications of outbreaks of disease and reports. Each ADIS network contact point is responsible for keeping the list of notification and reporting regions established by its EU country up to date in ADIS.   EUROPHYT network   Each EUROPHYT network member designates:   a contact point responsible for submitting outbreak notifications to the outbreak network; and   a contact point responsible for   supervising the submission of interception notifications for consignments of plants, plant products and other objects entering the EU   submitting interception notifications for those consignments traded in the EU, using TRACES, within 2 working days of the interception.      TRACES    Each TRACES network member designates at least one contact point for each functionality that is available in TRACES.   Each operator has access to the data, information or documents it handles, produces or transmits in TRACES, and each competent authority has similar access for those data, information or documents handled, produced or transmitted under its area of responsibility whether by its staff or by the operators it manages in TRACES.   EU countries’ customs authorities have access to data, information and documents relating to animals and goods entering the EU from non-EU countries and to any official control decisions, through either TRACES or EU countries’ national systems, or the EU Single Window environment for customs when interconnected with TRACES.   The regulation lists the requirements for issuing electronic official certificates for consignments of animals and goods entering the EU.   The TRACES network contact points need to maintain and keep up to date the lists of the designated border control posts, control points and approved or registered food business or animal by-products establishments.    Common Health Entry Document (CHED)   The regulation sets out the template of the CHED and instructions for its use and lays down the requirements for the use of an electronic CHED.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 14 December 2019, except for Section 2 of Chapter 3 on the ADIS network, which applies from 21 April 2021.   background   For more information, see:    Legislation on official controls  (  European Commission  )    RASFF — Food and Feed Safety Alerts  (  European Commission  )    Integrated Management System for Official Controls — IMSOC  (  European Commission  )    European Union Notification System for Plant Health Interceptions — EUROPHYT  (  European Commission  )    TRACES  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    IMSOC:  the information management system for official controls, set up to handle and automatically exchange data, information and documents related to the agri-food chain.   ADIS:  the computerised information system for notifying and reporting animal diseases, set up by Article 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/429.   EUROPHYT:  the EU notification system for submitting EUROPHYT outbreak notifications, in accordance with Article 103 of Regulation (EU) 2016/2031.   TRACES:  the computerised system for exchanging data, information and documents concerning official controls and other official activities.

   Environment and sustainable management of natural resources, including energy     Environment and sustainable management of natural resources, including energy     The Commission is proposing a programme of measures for the environment and the sustainable management of resources which could be financed by the Community and implemented as part of the European Union's external policy.     ACT     Commission Communication of 25 January 2006, entitled: "External action: Thematic programme for environment and sustainable management of natural resources including energy" [       COM(2006) 20      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The Commission is proposing a       thematic programme      for the environment and the sustainable management of natural resources, for which it defines the scope, objectives and priorities.     This thematic programme covers measures which concern mainly the ecological dimension of development policy and the other external policies, and which also seek to promote the environmental and energy policies of the European Union (EU) elsewhere in the world. These measures will be financed through the new instruments defined under the financial perspective 2007-13.     The programme is intended to supplement measures in the field of the environment and natural resources (including energy) under national and regional programmes. It includes the opportunity to give priority to measures regarded as world priorities, to cover all the partner countries (except the pre-accession and potentially candidate countries) and to retain some flexibility as regards programming and partnerships.     The programme priorities are:      working to achieve Millennium Development Goal 7 (Ensure Environmental Sustainability), principally by building capacity to integrate the environment in developing countries, support civil society actors, monitoring and evaluation and the preparation of innovative solutions;       promoting implementation of EU initiatives and commitments at international level, including in the areas of sustainable development, climate change, biodiversity, desertification, forests and their governance, marine resources, waste and chemical products, etc.;       improving the integration by the EU of environmental questions, particularly as regards combating poverty, by expanding the EU's responsibilities and through cooperation and specialist aid;       improving international governance as regards the environment and the EU's driving role, particularly by assisting regional and international environmental monitoring and assessment, aid for implementing multilateral agreements on the environment, and support for international organisations and processes concerned with the environment and energy;       promoting options for renewable energy, particularly through institutional support and technical assistance, the creation of a legislative and administrative framework propitious for investment and business and encouragement for regional cooperation.       Context      This programme is one of a series of seven thematic programmes in the areas of: human rights and democracy, investment in human resources, the environment and sustainable management of natural resources (including energy), food safety, the participation of non-State actors in the development process, migration and asylum, and cooperation with the industrialised countries.     Along with Community, national and regional programmes, these new programmes will constitute the backbone of the Commission's work on external cooperation after 2007.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007 on public passenger transport services by rail and by road   what is the aim of the regulation   Known as the  public service obligation (PSO) regulation  , it sets out conditions under which transport operators can be  compensated  or given  exclusive rights  by public authorities to provide public transport services which are in the general interest but would otherwise not be commercially viable. By establishing public service obligations, authorities aim to ensure that passengers can access safe, efficient, attractive and high-quality public passenger transport services.   It repeals Council Regulations (EEC) No  1191/69  and (EEC) No  1107/70  . It was last modified by Regulation (EU)  2016/2338  .   key points   The PSO regulation sets out:   an  obligation  for authorities to conclude  public service  contracts when they   give  exclusive rights  which entitle a public transport operator to provide certain public passenger transport services on a particular route or network or in a particular area, excluding all other operators and/or   give  compensation  to public transport operators to cover the costs incurred in providing public service obligations;      rules  on how public service contracts must be awarded;    rules  on how to calculate the amount of compensation.    Scope   The regulation applies to public passenger transport services by bus and by rail. However, EU countries can also apply it to public passenger transport by  inland waterways  and  national sea waters  .   Public service contracts and general rules    The authority which is competent for a given area must conclude a public service contract granting an operator an  exclusive right  and/or  compensation  in exchange for providing PSOs.   Obligations to apply  maximum tariffs  for all or certain categories of passengers may also be imposed via general rules, which apply to all operators without discrimination.   The authority grants compensation to offset the impact of the public service obligations on the operator’s costs and revenues.   The public service contracts (and general rules) define:   the public service obligations to be discharged;   the rules for calculating compensation and the nature and the scope of any exclusive rights;   overcompensation must be avoided;   how the costs linked to service supply (staff costs, energy, infrastructure, rolling stock, maintenance, etc.) should be allocated;   how revenue from the sale of tickets is to be allocated (whether it is kept by the operator, repaid to the authority, or shared).     The  duration of public service contracts  must  not exceed 10 years for bus and coach services  , and  15 years for rail or other track-based forms of transport  .    Awarding public service contracts    Public service contracts must be awarded according to the rules of this regulation. However, for awarding certain passenger transport services by  bus or tram  , the  public procurement  procedures of Directives 2014/25/EC (see summary  Public purchasing — rules for water, energy, transport and postal sectors  ) and 2014/24/EC apply (see summary  Public contracts — setting out clear ground rules  ).   As a general rule, competent authorities must award public service contracts by  transparent and non-discriminatory competitive procedures  .   However, the obligation to award contracts by a competitive procedure does not apply:   where a local authority provides public transport services itself or assigns them to an  internal transport operator  (a separate body, which the local authority controls in a similar way to one of its own departments);   where the  volume of the contract is modest    estimated average annual value of less than €1 million or   less than 300,000 kilometres of public passenger transport services;     where  emergency measures  are taken or contracts are imposed in response to actual or potential service interruptions.      Public service contracts in the rail sector   Regulation (EU) 2016/2338 has amended this regulation by introducing the principle of competitive award also for public service contracts in the railway sector, which was previously excluded. Long transition periods were allowed, to enable authorities and operators to adapt to the new rules.  Direct award of rail contracts remains possible in exceptional and well-defined circumstances, notably where:   it is justified by  structural and geographical characteristics  of the market and network (size, demand characteristics, network complexity, technical and geographical isolation, type of services); and   it would result in an  improvement in quality of services or cost-efficiency  , or both, compared to the previous contract;   the  volume of the contract is modest    estimated average annual value less than € 7.5 million per year or   fewer than 500,000 kilometres.      Transition period   Unconditional, direct awards of rail public service contracts will no longer be possible as of 25 December 2023.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 3 December 2009, except for Article 5 on awarding of public service contracts, which applies from 3 December 2019.   background   For more information, see:    Public service obligations and competition rules  (  European Commission  )    Land transport  (  European Commission  )    EU competition policy in the transport sector  (  European Commission  ).
   ERDF: European Regional Development Fund     ERDF: European Regional Development Fund     This regulation defines the scope of assistance from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) during the period 2000-06. The Fund aims to promote economic and social cohesion by correcting the main regional imbalances and participating in the development and conversion of regions, while ensuring synergy with assistance from the other Structural Funds.     ACT     Council Regulation (EC) No       1783/1999      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 June 1999 on the European Regional Development Fund [Official Journal L 213 of 13.08.1999].     3) SUMMARY      Framework and tasks      Regulation (EC) No       1783/1999      comes under the overall framework established by Council Regulation (EC) No       1260/1999      laying down       general provisions on the Structural Funds      . It requires the ERDF to provide assistance under the new       Objectives 1      and       2      , the Community Initiatives for cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation (       Interreg III      ) and economic and social regeneration of cities and urban neighbourhoods in crisis (       Urban II      ), and innovative measures and technical assistance measures under the general Regulation.     In order to reduce the gap between the levels of development of the various regions and the extent to which the least-favoured regions and islands (including rural areas) are lagging behind, the ERDF contributes to the harmonious, balanced and sustainable development of economic activity, to a high degree of competitiveness, to high levels of employment and protection of the environment, and to equality between women and men.      Scope      As part of its task to promote regional development, the ERDF contributes towards financing the following measures:      Productive investment to create and safeguard sustainable jobs;       Investment in infrastructure which contributes, in regions covered by Objective 1, to development, structural adjustment and creation and maintenance of sustainable jobs, or, in all eligible regions, to diversification, revitalisation, improved access and regeneration of economic sites and industrial areas suffering from decline, depressed urban areas, rural areas and areas dependent on fisheries. Such investment may also target the development of trans-European networks in the areas of transport, telecommunications and energy in the regions covered by Objective 1;       Development of the endogenous potential by measures which support local development and employment initiatives and the activities of small and medium-sized enterprises; such assistance is aimed at services for enterprises, transfer of technology, development of financing instruments, direct aid to investment, provision of local infrastructure, and aid for structures providing neighbourhood services;       Investment in education and health (only in the context of Objective 1).      The areas in which these measures provide support include development of the productive environment, research and technological development, development of the information society, protection and improvement of the environment, equality between men and women in the field of employment, and cross-border transnational and inter-regional cooperation.     Pursuant to the general Regulation, the Community's Interreg III Initiative and innovative measures (studies, pilot projects, exchanges of experience) in the field of regional or local development are financed exclusively by the ERDF. However, the scope of the ERDF may be extended to overlap with the other Structural Funds in order to cover the necessary measures for the implementation of the Initiative programmes or pilot projects concerned.      Implementing rules      Implementing rules for the ERDF Regulation may be adopted on the basis of the opinion of the Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions.      Other provisions      This Regulation repeals Regulation (EEC) No       4254/88      with effect from 1 January 2000. It will, in turn, be reviewed by 31 December 2006 at the latest.          Act               Dateof entry into force               Final date for implementation in the Member States               Regulation (EC) No.                 1260/1999                16.08.1999               -          RELATED ACTS     Proposal of 14 July 2004 for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Regional Development Fund [       COM (2004) 495      final].     This document proposes the repeal of the present Regulation.     Proposal of 14 July 2004 for a Regulation of the Council laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund       COM (2004) 492      final.      ERDF INNOVATIVE MEASURES       Commission communication of 31.01.2001, "The regions in the new economy : Guidelines for innovative measures under the ERDF, 2000      -       06" [         COM(2001) 60        final      -       Not published in the Official Journal]      Based on Article 22 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, this       communication      lays down that the aim of the innovative measures (studies, pilot projects and exchanges of experience) to which the ERDF contributes is to reinforce competitiveness in Europe by reducing the gaps between regions and supporting innovation, RTD and the use of new information and communication technologies. It therefore forms part of the strategy approved at the European Council in Lisbon on 23/24 March 2000, which aims at boosting employment, economic competitiveness and social cohesion in the framework of a knowledge-based economy.     In the period 2000-2006 the innovative measures must therefore concentrate on three priorities:      regional economy based on knowledge and technological innovation : helping the less-favoured regions to raise the level of their technology;       the information society at the service of regional development (e Europe-regio);       regional identity and sustainable development : promoting regional cohesion and competitiveness through an approach which integrates economic, environmental and social activity.      Implementing the innovative measures should also make it possible to:      improve the quality of assistance under the Objective 1 and 2 programmes to which the ERDF contributes;       enhance and strengthen the public-private partnership;       exploit the synergies between regional policy and the other Community policies;       have exchanges between regions and collective learning by means of the comparison and spread of best practice.      The innovative measures form part of regional programmes of innovative measures whose strategy is determined, in line with the regional partnership principle, by a steering committee. Programme proposals must be submitted to the Commission by 31 May each year at the latest from 2001 to 2005 so that the Commission can select those to be part-financed by the ERDF.     The innovative measures have an annual allocation of EUR 400 million, or 0.4 of the ERDF's annual funding. Part-financing of their cost may amount to up to:      80 %, in Objective 1 regions;       50 %, or even 60 % where the Community relevance of the measures justifies it, in Objective 2 regions.      For reasons of consistency, it would be preferable if the bodies responsible for payment and monitoring were the same in the case of both the programmes of innovative measures and the Objective 1 and 2 programmes.     Programming in accordance with the       general Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999      .

   Dismantling the obstacles to EU citizens’ rights     Dismantling the obstacles to EU citizens’ rights     This report launches a debate on EU citizens’ rights by describing the main obstacles to the enjoyment of these rights across national borders and by proposing solutions for overcoming these obstacles.     ACT     EU citizenship report 2010 of 27 October 2010 – Dismantling the obstacles to EU citizens’ rights [       COM(2010) 603      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The report is a strategic initiative of the Commission and presents the main obstacles European Union (EU) citizens continue to face in their daily lives when exercising their EU rights across national borders. It also provides an overview of the measures the Commission intends to take to overcome these obstacles. In parallel with this report, the Commission also adopted the communication “       Towards a Single Market Act      ”, which focuses on the obstacles that consumers, entrepreneurs, workers, etc. face when acting within the single market.     The report identifies the main obstacles that EU citizens may still confront in their private, academic or professional life, when consuming goods and services or in their role as political actors. It proposes concrete solutions to be implemented by the Commission in the next years. A complete list of the 25 legislative actions and other measures aimed at facilitating EU citizens’ daily lives can be found at the end of the report.      Citizens as private individuals      To eliminate the main obstacles EU citizens face in cross-border situations in their private lives, the Commission will propose a series of measures aimed at:      making it easier for international couples to know which courts have jurisdiction and which law applies to their property rights;       facilitating the free circulation of civil status documents and enabling citizens to easily find multilingual information on justice via the European e-Justice web portal;       improving the protection of victims of crime and of persons suspected and accused in criminal proceedings;       simplifying the formalities and conditions for the registration of cars previously registered in another EU country and finding solutions to double registration taxes or discriminatory tax treatment of cars;       facilitating access to cross-border health care and to eHealth technologies;       ensuring that EU citizens whose country of origin does not have a consulate in a non-EU country are effectively assisted by the consulate of any other EU country.       Citizens as consumers      When buying holiday packages or when travelling within the EU as passengers or as tourists, citizens are often not aware of their rights or are confronted with situations where these rights are not sufficiently enforced. Persons with disabilities often face additional difficulties, notably in accessing transportation, information and other goods and services.     EU citizens are still hesitant to purchase goods and services across national borders, mainly because they lack confidence in consumer protection rules (currently, there is no single set of EU-wide consumer protection rules) or are insufficiently aware of the means of redress available to them.     To remove these barriers, the Commission will take a series of initiatives in order to:      modernise current rules for the protection of consumers buying package travel;       ensure a set of common rights for passengers travelling by any transport mode;       propose an EU Disability Strategy 2010-20;       increase consumer confidence in tourism products;       set out in an understandable way the rights of users of online services;       facilitate fast and inexpensive out-of-court resolution of consumer problems (such as Alternative Dispute Resolution mechanisms and mediation).       Citizens as residents, students and professionals      Due to some EU countries’ incorrect application of EU law on EU citizens’ right to free movement within the Union, as well as the cumbersome administrative procedures that they can sometimes impose, citizens are faced with particular difficulties with regard to entry, residence and access to various kinds of benefits. Further obstacles hindering work abroad relate, among others, to EU countries’ divergent social security systems and to complex cooperation between national social security institutions.     To tackle these problems, the Commission will:      strictly enforce EU rules on free movement and step up dissemination of information to EU citizens;       improve the provision of information to citizens on their social security rights, whilst developing a new system of electronic exchange of data to reduce delays and difficulties in the exchange of social security.       Citizens as political actors      EU citizens participate less and less in European Parliament elections, which is partly attributed to the lack of information on how the EU can impact their lives. Furthermore, the conditions that a few EU countries impose for nationals of other EU countries living in their territory to vote and stand as candidates in these elections or for founding or becoming members of political parties can pose an obstacle to the exercise of citizens’ voting rights.     To eliminate these obstacles, the Commission will ask EU countries to ensure that:      EU citizens’ voting rights in their EU country of residence are fully enforced;       EU citizens can be members of or found political parties in their EU country of residence;       EU citizens are duly informed of their electoral rights.       Information on EU citizens’ rights      Citizens are familiar with the term “citizen of the EU”, but are often not aware of the precise content of the rights that EU citizenship brings them, and are thus prevented from fully making use of these rights. Even though there is already a wealth of EU-level information and problem-solving networks on citizens’ rights, many citizens either are not aware of these networks or are frustrated because information is distributed among multiple sources and therefore hard to find.     To strengthen citizens' awareness of their rights as EU citizens and the meaning of these rights in their daily lives, the Commission is taking a series of measures with a view to:      further developing the Your Europe web portal into an easy to use one-stop-shop information point on the rights of citizens, accessible via the web and a free phone number;       streamlining its information networks in EU countries so that citizens easily find the right contact point at national, regional and local level;       designating 2013 as the European Year of Citizens;       making it simpler for citizens to use the financial support provided by EU level programmes such as “         Europe for Citizens (2007-13)        ” and “         Fundamental rights and citizenship (2007-13)        ”;       strengthening independent, professional and high-quality reporting on European affairs.

   Contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services     Contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services     SUMMARY OF:      Directive (EU) 2019/770 on certain aspects concerning contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services      WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?      It sets out rules concerning         contracts        for the supply of digital content or digital services, in particular:          rules on conformity with the contract; and           remedies where the digital content or digital service does not conform or if there is a failure to supply.         Digital content includes computer programmes and mobile applications, as well as video and audio files in digital form.       Digital services include, for instance, cloud computing services and social media.       The directive is part of the         digital single market strategy for Europe        .      KEY POINTS      Scope      The directive applies to any contract where a trader supplies digital content or digital services to the consumer and the consumer pays or undertakes to pay a price. It also applies when the consumer does not pay a price but provides or undertakes to provide personal data to the trader, unless the personal data provided are only processed for the purpose of supplying the digital content or digital service or for the trader to comply with legal requirements.     Exceptions include contracts regarding:      goods with digital elements (which are regulated in Directive (EU)         2019/771        );       internet access;       texting (such as SMS), with the exception of number-independent interpersonal communications;       healthcare;       gambling services;       financial services;       software offered under a free and open-source licence (where no price is paid and the personal data provided by the consumer is used only to improve the specific software);       digital content as part of a performance or event, such as digital cinematographic projection;       digital content provided by public sector bodies in accordance with Directive         2003/98/EC        .       Conformity      Digital content or digital services in general must:      fit the description, quantity and quality, and have other features such as functionality, compatibility, interoperability, as required by the contract;       be fit for the purpose agreed as part of the contract process;       be supplied with all accessories, instructions and assistance as required by the contract;       be updated as stipulated by the contract;       be fit for the purposes for which digital content or digital services of the same type would normally be used;       have the quality and performance features (including functionality, compatibility, accessibility, continuity and security), which the consumer could reasonably expect;       be supplied with any accessories and instructions which the consumer may reasonably expect to receive;       comply with any trial or preview version made available before the contract was concluded.      Traders must ensure that the consumer is informed of and supplied with updates, including security updates, necessary to keep the digital content or digital service in conformity. The directive also contains more detailed rules on the obligation to provide updates.      Trader's liability       The trader is liable for:          any             failure to supply            the digital content or digital service;           any             lack of conformity            of the digital content or digital service that exists at the time of supply and becomes apparent within a minimum of two years. If the lack of conformity becomes apparent during the first year, the consumer will not need to prove that it existed at the time of supply.         When the digital content or digital service is supplied continuously, the trader is liable for any lack of conformity that occurs and becomes apparent throughout the period of supply.       Remedies       Where the trader has         failed to supply        the digital content or digital service without undue delay or within an agreed time-frame, following a reminder, the consumer is entitled to terminate the contract.       In the case of a         lack of conformity        , the consumer is entitled to have the digital content or digital service brought into conformity (unless this is impossible or would impose disproportionate costs on the trader). If the trader fails to do so, the consumer is entitled to receive a proportionate reduction in the price or to terminate the contract.       When the contract is terminated, the trader must         fully reimburse        the consumer, except for periods when the continuously supplied digital content or digital service was in conformity.       Obligations and rights in the event of termination of the contract       Once the contract is terminated, traders must comply with the personal data obligations of Regulation (EU)         2016/679        (         General Data Protection Regulation        ). Under certain conditions, traders must:          also refrain from using content that is not personal data and was provided or created by the consumer when using the digital content or digital service;           also allow consumers to retrieve such content free of charge, without hindrance from the trader, within a reasonable time.         After the termination of the contract, consumers must refrain from using the digital content or digital service and from making it available to third parties.       EU countries must ensure that there are effective means to ensure compliance with this directive.      The directive complements Directive (EU) 2019/771 on       contracts for the sale of goods      .     FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?     It has to become law in the EU countries by 1 July 2021.

act   Directive  2014/33/EU  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to lifts and safety components for lifts   summary   European Union (EU) law on the sale and putting into service of lifts and safety components for lifts has two key aims: i) to allow lifts and their safety components to be sold throughout the EU market; and ii) to ensure a high level of safety for lift users and maintenance staff.   what does this directive do  The directive lays down uniform rules on the sale and putting into service of lifts and safety components for lifts. It applies to lifts that permanently serve buildings and constructions and that are intended for the transport of persons and goods. It does not apply to funicular railways, hoists and escalators or walkways.   key points   The directive defines the responsibilities of manufacturers, importers and distributors in the context of the sale of lifts and safety components for lifts:   all lifts and safety components on sale in the EU must bear the  CE conformity marking  to show that they meet all the essential safety requirements of EU legislation;   before obtaining the CE marking, the manufacturer must conduct a safety and conformity assessment and establish technical documentation for its lifts and components;   importers must check whether manufacturers have carried out conformity assessments correctly and inform the authority monitoring the safety if they consider that the lifts or components do not conform with the essential safety requirements;   all necessary documentation must be recorded and kept for 10 years;   documentation and safety information must be written in a language easily understood by end -users;   manufacturers and importers must indicate their postal address on their safety components and lifts;   manufacturers may use electronic means to demonstrate conformity.   In addition, the directive specifies how national authorities who monitor safety must identify and prevent the import of dangerous safety components or lifts from non-EU countries.   when does the directive apply  This directive applies from 18 April 2014. It repeals  Directive 95/16/EC  with effect from 20 April 2016.   background   The directive updates EU rules for the sale of lifts and safety components for lifts. This is part of the effort to modernise European law in a wide variety of industrial sectors, which aims to simplify the rules, reduce administrative burdens and establish clearer and more consistent rules.

   Internalisation of external transport costs     Internalisation of external transport costs     The internalisation of external costs forms part of a package of initiatives aimed at making transport more sustainable. It consists of including external transport costs (pollution, noise, congestion, etc.) in the price paid by the user, so as to encourage them to change their behaviour.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 8 July 2008 “Strategy for the internalisation of external costs” [       COM(2008) 435 final      – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Transport users have to pay the costs related to the use of their mode of transport (fuel, insurance, etc.). Such costs are considered private in the sense that they are paid directly by the user. Transport users also generate       external costs,      negative externalities (delays as a result of congestion, health problems caused by noise and air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, etc.), which they do not bear directly and which have a cost to society as a whole. The sum of the private and external costs of transport gives its       social       cost.      Internalisation involves reflecting the external costs in the price of transport. However, only a price based on the total social costs will take account of the services used and the consumption of resources. The aim is to make users more aware of the costs they generate and to encourage them to change their behaviour in order to reduce them.      Instruments      The main economic instruments for internalising external costs are taxation, tolls and       CO2 emissions trading      . However, each external cost has specific characteristics which require the use of appropriate instruments. Some external costs relate to the use of infrastructure, vary according to time and place and are highly localised (congestion, noise, accidents and pollution). This justifies the use of differentiated charging which takes these variations into account. Other external costs, such as climate change, are global and a result of energy consumption. It is therefore more appropriate to use an instrument directly linked to that consumption, such as a fuel tax.     The Commission points out that ensuring that the internal market continues to function properly, a basic principle of the European Union (EU), is essential. Consequently, it must avoid overcharging as this could hamper freedom of movement. Fragmentation of the market must also be avoided. Setting common principles for all Member States, together with a monitoring system, should prevent any discrimination and ensure market transparency.      General principles for internalisation      The accepted general principle for the internalisation of external transport costs is       “social marginal cost charging”      . According to this approach, transport prices should correspond to the additional short-term cost generated by one extra person using the infrastructure. Charging based on the additional costs imposed on society would help ensure fair treatment of both transport users and non-users and would create a direct link between the use of shared resources and payment on the basis of the “polluter pays” and “user pays” principles. The Commission proposes common principles and a common methodology for calculating the external costs of congestion, air pollution, noise and climate change.     As it would be difficult for one internalisation mechanism to be applicable to all forms of transport, the Commission anticipates that the same principle will be applied using different instruments.      Road haulage sector      The Commission proposes revising the “       Eurovignette      ” Directive (see related acts) in order to enable internalisation of external costs. Furthermore, the Commission will propose an Intelligent Transport System Action Plan aimed at increasing the use of technology. Finally, the Commission is to adopt Decisions to implement interoperability of electronic toll systems, as provided for in Directive       2004/52/EC      .      Urban mobility      Following the debate launched by the publication of the       Green Paper on urban transport      , the Commission will start to implement actions on sustainable urban mobility.      Passenger cars      A       proposal on passenger car related taxes      is under discussion. In particular, it provides for the restructuring of existing taxes in order to take CO2 emissions into account.      Rail transport      Directive       2001/14/EC      already allows internalisation of external costs, under certain conditions. Moreover, the Commission has published a Communication on noise reduction measures (see related acts).      Air transport      The Commission put forward a proposal to include CO2 emissions from the aviation sector in the European Emissions Trading System (       ETS      ) and is drawing up another proposal aimed at reducing nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. Finally, as part of the “       airport package      ”, the Commission put forward a Directive on airport charges, which could include differentiated charging on the basis of environmental damage.      Maritime transport and inland waterways      The Commission may put forward a proposal to include the maritime sector in the ETS. With regard to inland waterways, the Commission points out that the internalisation of external costs could revitalise       inland waterway transport      , given the energy efficiency of this mode of transport.      Use of revenue      The Commission points out that there is a considerable need for funding to make transport sustainable (research, innovation, infrastructure, development of public transport, etc.). It believes that revenue generated by internalisation should be earmarked for the transport sector and the reduction of external costs.     RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council of 8 July 2008 on “Greening Transport       ”       [         COM(2008) 433 final        – Not published in the Official Journal].       Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council of 8 July 2008 on “Rail noise abatement measures addressing the existing fleet”       [         COM(2008) 432 final        – Not published in the Official Journal].      As part of measures to tackle noise pollution, the Commission is putting forward a proposal to launch a programme to reduce noise pollution generated by freight trains. In order to encourage railway undertakings to proceed with retrofitting wagons, the Commission considers putting in place noise-differentiated track access charges, in particular. In the course of the recast of Directive 2001/14/EC, the Commission will propose legal requirements for the implementation of such charges, following the principle that infrastructure charges can take account of the cost of the environmental impact of train operations.      Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 July 2008 amending Directive 1999/62/EC on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures       [         COM(2008) 436 final        – Not published in the Official Journal].      The revision of the "Eurovignette" Directive should enable Member States to internalise costs related to pollution and congestion caused by heavy goods (external costs). They will also be able to integrate an amount which reflects the cost of air and noise pollution caused by traffic and the cost of congestion imposed upon other vehicles into tolls levied on heavy goods vehicles. The amounts will vary depending on the Euro emission category, the distance travelled, the location and time of use of roads. Member States must use the revenue gained in this way on projects related to developing sustainable transport. The charge must be collected through electronic systems which do not create hindrance to the free flow of traffic or local nuisance at tollbooths. Moreover, the scope of the Directive is intended to extend beyond the trans-European transport network.     Last updated: 23.10.2008  
   Defence procurement exemptions     Defence procurement exemptions     This Communication aims to prevent possible misinterpretation and misuse of exemptions to Article 296 EC in the field of defence procurement. To this end, the Commission has set out its views on the principles governing the application of Article 296 EC and explained its understanding of how this Article should be applied.     ACT     Commission interpretative communication of 7 December 2006 on the application of Article 296 of the Treaty in the field of defence procurement [       COM(2006) 779      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Internal market rules do not apply to defence acquisitions for trade in arms, munitions and war material; the legal basis for this exemption is Article 296. The scope of this exemption is, however, limited by the concept of "essential security interests" and by the list of military equipment mentioned in Article 296(2).     Any exemption authorised by Article 296 goes to the very heart of the fundamental principles and objectives of the internal market. Such exceptions should therefore be strictly confined to cases where Member States have no other choice than to protect their security interests nationally.     The list of military equipment mentioned in Article 296 was adapted in 1958 by Council Decision 255 / 58. The nature of the products on the 1958 list and the explicit reference in Article 296 to "specifically military purposes" confirm that only the procurement of equipment which is designed, developed and produced for specifically military purposes can be exempted from Community rules (Article 296(1)(b) EC).     Nevertheless, Article 296 can also cover the procurement of dual-use equipment for both military and non-military purposes, but only if the application of Community rules would oblige a Member State to disclose information prejudicial to its essential security interests (Article 296(1)(a)).     Military items included in the 1958 list are not automatically exempted from internal market rules. Any Member State seeking exemption under Article 296 must demonstrate that the exemption in question is necessary for the protection of its essential security interests, this being the only objective which may justify such an exemption. General references to the country's geographical and political situation, history and alliance commitments are not sufficient.     The concept of essential security interests gives Member States flexibility in the choice of measures to protect those interests. It is essential for contracting authorities to assess each procurement contract with great care.     As guardian of the Treaty, the Commission may verify - with due regard to the sensitive nature of the defence sector - whether the conditions for exempting procurement contracts on the basis of Article 296 are fulfilled.     The Commission may also bring the matter directly before the Court of Justice if it considers that a Member State is making improper use of the powers provided for in Article 296.      Background      The majority of defence contracts are exempted from internal market rules and awarded on the basis of widely differing national procurement rules. With a view to the establishment of a European defence equipment market, the 2004       Green Paper      on Defence Procurement (link) launches a debate on how to improve transparency and openness of defence markets between EU Member States. In December 2005 the Commission announced two separate initiatives (link to       COM(2005) 626      final): the adoption of an "Interpretative Communication on the application of Article 296 EC" (analysed above) and the preparation of a possible new directive on the procurement of defence equipment to which Article 296 exemptions do not apply.

   2007 Environment Policy Review     2007 Environment Policy Review     The 2007 Environment Policy Review reports on progress in European Union (EU) policy during 2007 and analyses coming challenges.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 2 July 2008 “2007 Environment policy review” [       COM(2008) 409 final      – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The Commission highlights that a certain number of decisive steps were taken in 2007 in European Union environmental policy, with in particular the endorsement by the European Council of the energy and climate change package. In January 2008, the Commission translated the commitments into concrete action by adopting a Climate Action and Renewable Energy implementation package which includes proposals on the improvement of the       greenhouse gas emission allowance trading scheme      , the participation of Member States in efforts to       reduce emissions from non-ETS sectors      , the       promotion of renewable energies      and the       geological storage of carbon      . The Commission also published       new guidelines on State aid for the protection of the environment      .     In other fields, the commitments under the       6th Environment Action Programme      have almost all been delivered. The Commission presented seven thematic strategies (       air      ,       waste prevention and recycling      ,       marine environment      ,       soil      ,       pesticides      ,       natural resources      and       urban environment      ) and the accompanying legislative proposals have been adopted or are being adopted. Moreover, an       Industrial Emissions      Directive has been adopted. The       REACH      Regulation, the       Environmental Liability      Directive and the Regulation on       hazardous waste shipment      came into force.      Financial instruments      New financial instruments for environmental policy became operational in 2007, including       LIFE+      , the       Thematic programme for the environment and the sustainable management of natural resources, including energy      , and the       financial instrument for civil protection      .      “Better Regulation”      The Commission has also continued to take action to simplify legislation and to improve its efficiency, in particular by presenting a Green Paper devoted to       market-based instruments      and guidelines to clarify standards for monitoring and declaring greenhouse gas emissions.      The environment in other policies      Integration of the environment into other policies progressed in 2007, particularly in transport with the entry into force of the Regulation on pollutant emissions from light vehicles (       Euro 5 and Euro 6 standards      ) and proposals on new norms for CO2 emissions from       new vehicles      and heavy-duty vehicles, and on       fuel quality      . This integration has also been continued in the fields of agriculture, cohesion policy, development, health, industrial policy, research and commercial policy.      International      Internationally, 2007 was marked in particular by the decision taken in Bali to work on a global agreement on the warming of the climate system after 2012, the decision of the 14th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species to declare a nine-year moratorium on ivory sales, and the launch of negotiations between the Commission, Indonesia, Ghana and Cameroon on logging.      Challenges in 2008 and beyond      Despite progress made in 2007, the Commission highlights that efforts must not be relaxed because there are still many challenges ahead. It also stresses the need to strengthen implementation of environmental policy, which is often slow or incomplete in Member States. To this end, the Commission will step up its efforts to support Member States through better information exchange, guidance and training.     In 2008, the Commission will present an       Action Plan on Sustainable Consumption and Production      , a revision of the Community Eco-Management and Audit System (EMAS) and the       Ecolabel scheme      , and will present a White Paper on adaptation to climate change.      Context      This annual activity report aims at ensuring that the 6th Environment Action Programme is monitored. It also aims to contribute to the Lisbon Process and the European Sustainable     Development Strategy.     Last updated: 09.10.2008  
   Civil Protection Mechanism     Civil Protection Mechanism     The Community Civil Protection Mechanism supports and facilitates the mobilisation of emergency services to meet the immediate needs of countries hit by disaster or at risk from one. It improves the coordination of assistance interventions by defining the obligations of European Union (EU) countries and the Commission and by establishing certain bodies and procedures, such as the Monitoring and Information Centre (MIC).     ACT     Council Decision       2007/779/EC, Euratom      of 8 November 2007 establishing a Community Civil Protection Mechanism (recast).     SUMMARY     A cooperation mechanism is set up to improve the coordination of civil protection assistance intervention in major emergencies. Such cases may arise from a natural, technological, radiological or environmental disaster, including accidental marine pollution, or from a terrorist act, occurring or threatening to occur inside or outside the European Union (EU).     The mechanism is based on a series of elements and actions, including:      compiling an inventory of assistance and intervention teams available in EU countries;       establishing a training programme for members of such teams;       launching workshops, seminars and pilot projects on the main aspects of interventions;       setting up assessment and coordination teams;       establishing a Monitoring and Information Centre (MIC) and a common communication and information system;       establishing a Common Emergency Communication and Information System (CECIS) between the MIC and EU countries’ contact points;       helping to develop detection and early warning systems;       facilitating access to equipment and transport by providing information on the resources available from EU countries and identifying resources available from other sources;       making additional transport resources available.       Preparing for emergencies      In order to establish this mechanism, EU countries must in particular:      identify the teams available for intervention within 12 hours following a request for assistance;       select experts who can be called upon to take part in an assessment or coordination team;       develop interoperable intervention modules employing the resources of one or more EU countries, which are able to carry out missions in case of emergencies;       examine the possibility of providing additional specialised assistance should a particular emergency occur;       provide all relevant information for setting up the mechanism, not later than six months after the adoption of this decision;       designate the competent authorities and contact points for implementing this decision.      Furthermore, if they so wish, EU countries may provide information on the availability of military resources in their response to requests for assistance.     For its part, the European Commission assumes responsibility for setting up and managing the MIC, the CECIS and the training programme for intervention teams. It will mobilise and send small teams of experts to the site of the emergency to assess the needs and, if necessary, to help coordinate operations there. It will also introduce a programme of lessons learned from interventions and disseminate these lessons throughout the information system, as well as collect and centralise information on national medical resource availability.     Information on the national civil protection capabilities available for assistance interventions is compiled in a database. This includes the contents of the military database, compiled by the EU Military Staff (EUMS), giving it a broad picture of all resources available to manage the consequences of disasters.      Responding to emergencies      The operational heart of the mechanism is the MIC, which is based at the European Commission in Brussels. Through the MIC, which is accessible 24 hours a day, the Commission can facilitate the mobilisation of civil protection resources from EU countries in the event of an emergency.     Any participating country affected by or at risk of being affected by a major disaster – inside or outside the EU – can request assistance from an EU country directly or through the MIC. The MIC then immediately forwards the request to the network of national contact points. They inform the MIC whether they are in a position to offer assistance. The MIC then compiles the responses and informs the requesting country of the available assistance. The affected country selects the assistance it needs and establishes contact with the assisting countries. The MIC can also offer technical support, including improved access to satellite images, and acts as an information centre, collecting data and distributing regular updates to all participating countries.     While the requesting country is responsible for supervising the assistance operations, it is up to the country offering the assistance to appoint someone responsible for the implementation details of the operation. The requesting country can delegate the supervision of the operations to the intervention teams who must then coordinate their actions, if necessary with the support of the experts from the assessment and/or coordination teams.     In the case of an assistance intervention in a non-EU country, the Council Presidency is responsible for the political and strategic coordination of the operations, while the Commission retains its role as operational coordinator. Operational coordination involves in particular the task of facilitating dialogue and contact with the national contact points, the non-EU country affected and other relevant actors such as the services of the United Nations (UN). In addition, the UN is responsible for overall coordination of the operations when it is providing services at the scene of the emergency.     Candidate countries for EU accession and non-EU countries can participate in the mechanism. Today, 30 countries – the EU-27, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway – participate in the mechanism, which is funded on a year-by-year basis.     The Commission submits a report on the implementation of this decision every three years.      Background      In January 2006, the Commission proposed to reinforce the existing European Civil Protection Mechanism on the basis of past experience and to provide a suitable legal basis for future action in this area. This reinforcement is designed to deal with the increase in frequency and seriousness of natural and man-made disasters.     This cooperation instrument, resulting from the above Commission proposal, replaces the mechanism for assistance interventions established by Council Decision       2001/792/EC, Euratom      , repealed by this decision.      References           Act               Entry into force               Deadline for transposition in the Member States               Official Journal               Decision                 2007/779/EC, Euratom                8.11.2007               -               OJ L 314 of 1.12.2007          RELATED ACTS       Council Decision 2007/162/EC, Euratom        of 5 March 2007 establishing a Civil Protection Financial Instrument [Official Journal L 71 of 10.3.2007].      The EU has an instrument that enables it to fund activities aimed at preventive action, preparedness and an effective response, particularly those carried out under the existing mechanism. This financial instrument covers the 2007-13 period and replaces the Community action programme in favour of civil protection, established by       Council Decision 1999/847/EC      .

Council Resolution of 22 December 2003 on strengthening Community cooperation in the field of         civil protection research        [Official Journal C 8 of 13.1.2004].      The Council encourages the development of research projects on the reduction of natural and technological risks and on mitigating their consequences. It also encourages research institutes and other relevant entities to establish common objectives for preventing and reacting to natural or technological risks.      Council Resolution of 19 December 2002 on         special civil protection assistance        to outermost and isolated regions, to insular regions, to regions which are not easily accessible, and to sparsely populated regions, in the European Union [Official Journal C 24 of 31.1.2003].      The Council considers that outermost, isolated, distant insular and sparsely populated regions should benefit from measures suited to their individual situations. In particular, it encourages joint projects between regions with similar characteristics and the taking into consideration of these characteristics when planning responses to emergency situations, setting up specialised intervention teams and developing effective, reliable and adapted communication systems.      Council Resolution of 28 January 2002 on reinforcing cooperation in the field of         civil protection training        [Official Journal C 43 of 16.2.2002].      The Council invites the Commission to look at any initiatives supporting the creation of a network of schools and training centres active in the field of civil protection and to give financial support to this initiative and involve the candidate countries in its work.

summary of   Decision No 553/2014/EU – EU participation in a research and development programme aimed at supporting research and development performing small and medium-sized enterprises   what is the aim of the decision  It sets up  Eurostars-2  , a joint programme designed for supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) performing research and development (R & D) and wishing to work together transnationally.   key points   Eurostars-2, which follows up on Eurostars-1, is co-funded by the European Union’s  Horizon 2020 programme  and the national budgets of more than 30 participating and partner countries of Eurostars-2. The partner countries are  EUREKA  members or countries associated with Eureka. The EU participates in this joint programme on the basis of Article 185 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (public-public partnership).   Objectives    Eurostars-2 aims to contribute to the further alignment and synchronisation of national R & D programmes. This is in order to achieve stronger scientific, management and financial integration of R & D across Europe.   It seeks to support research-performing SMEs (see below) to increase their knowledge and research intensity — and thus their innovative capacity — so as to expand their business activities into larger, often international, markets. This contributes to competitiveness, growth and job creation.    Definition   A ‘research and development-performing SME’ is defined as an SME which meets at least one of the following conditions:   it reinvests at least 10 % of its turnover in R & D activities;   it dedicates at least 10 % of its full-time equivalents (or the same number of hours worked by part-time staff) to R & D activities;   it has at least 5 full-time equivalents (for SMEs with fewer than 100 full-time equivalents) or 10 full-time equivalents (for SMEs with over 100 full-time equivalents) for R & D activities.    Participation and funding    Participation of legal entities under Eurostars-2 projects takes place in line with Horizon 2020 rules for participation and dissemination (  Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013  ) and the specific derogations contained in this Eurostars-2 decision. Other legal entities, such as universities and research institutes, may also participate in Eurostars-2 projects.   Legal entities from Eurostars-2 partner countries are not eligible for an EU financial contribution. The funding rules of the participating national programmes apply to Eurostars-2 grants which are channelled through National Funding Bodies (NFBs) to final beneficiaries. Further rules on eligibility for participation and funding are detailed in Eurostars-2 annual work plans.    Projects    Eurostars-2 projects are ‘bottom up’, transnational and focus on results that have  market potential  , i.e. within 2 years of the completion of an activity, the results of the projects are expected to be introduced on the market.    Implementation    ESE, the Eureka Secretariat, has been designated by the participating countries to implement Eurostars-2. ESE concludes bilateral agreements with NFBs which set out the responsibilities of the parties in relation to Eurostars-2 rules, objectives and implementation arrangements.   ESE organises the calls for proposals, the peer review (evaluation of work by one or more people of similar competence to the producers of the work (peers)), the selection and the monitoring of projects, as well as the allocation of the EU contribution.    Budget    The EU is contributing € 287 million to Eurostars-2 projects over the 2014–2024 period. This contribution is equivalent to at least one-third of the contribution provided by the national budgets of participating countries.   Some funding also comes from participating organisations.   The EU’s financial contribution is subject to formal commitments from the participating states. Financial support mainly takes the form of grants to selected projects.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 27 June 2014.   background   For more information, see:    ‘What is Eurostars’  on the Eureka website.
   EU rules on the authorisation, import and production of veterinary medicines     EU rules on the authorisation, import and production of veterinary medicines     SUMMARY OF:      Directive 2001/82/EC — the EU’s code relating to veterinary medicinal products      WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?     It sets out EU rules on the authorisation, manufacturing, supervision, sale, distribution and use of veterinary medicinal products       *      .     It will be repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU)       2019/6      as of 28 January 2022.     KEY POINTS       National authorities        must do the following:          Authorise veterinary medicines before they can be sold and used.           Establish a simplified registration procedure for             homeopathic veterinary medicines            .           Ensure manufacturers and distributors of veterinary medicines within their jurisdiction have the necessary authorisation. The former must also have the services of a suitably qualified expert.           Take appropriate measures to encourage the reporting of any             adverse reactions            to veterinary medicines.           Carry out             regular inspections            and tests to ensure manufacturers comply with the legislation.           Issue a             certificate of good manufacturing practice            if inspectors are satisfied standards are being respected. This is lodged in an EU database and must be done within 90 days.           Suspend, revoke or withdraw the marketing authorisation of a product considered dangerous or of no therapeutic benefit.         National authorities may, if there is a         serious outbreak of disease        , allow the use of products that have not received their authorisation. They must first inform the         European Commission        .        Market authorisation        :          is only granted to an applicant based in the EU;           is initially valid for 5 years;           may be renewed — either for a further 5 years or for an unlimited period of time.         The procedure for taking an authorisation decision must be completed within 210 days of the marketing authorisation holder’s request being received.       The applicant must provide all the administrative information and scientific documentation to prove the product’s         quality        ,         safety        and         efficacy        .       The marketing authorisation holder must take account of any scientific and technical progress made after receiving an authorisation and make the necessary changes in their manufacturing and control systems.       A coordination group examines the application if it is lodged in 2 or more EU countries.       Packages of veterinary medicines must contain         detailed information        , such as the manufacturer’s name and address, the strength of the product and its expiry date.        Imports        and         exports        of veterinary medicines also require the necessary authorisations.       The legislation does not apply to certain items such as medicinal products used in         research and development trials        or prepared by a pharmacist for one or a small group of animals.       National authorities may exempt medicinal products from the need for marketing authorisation for small pets, such as fish, birds, homing pigeons, terrarium animals (like lizards and crickets), small rodents, ferrets and rabbits.       Repeal      Directive 2001/82/EC will be repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU)       2019/6      as of 28 January 2022.     FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?     It has applied since 18 December 2001.     BACKGROUND     For more information, see:       Veterinary Medicines and Medicated Feed        (         European Commission        ).

   Media literacy in the digital environment     Media literacy in the digital environment     Media literacy represents a considerable challenge for the European Commission because it helps to provide European citizens with tools to better understand the digital environment, which is becoming more predominant in European society.     ACT     Commission Recommendation       2009/625/EC      of 20 August 2009 on media literacy in the digital environment for a more competitive audiovisual and content industry and an inclusive knowledge society.     SUMMARY     This Recommendation aims to increase media literacy in the digital environment in order to achieve a more competitive knowledge economy while contributing towards a more inclusive information society.      Definition      Media literacy is defined as the ability to access the media, and to understand and critically evaluate different aspects of the media and media content. Media literacy also includes the ability to communicate in a variety of contexts.      Barriers      There are still many barriers to the development of media literacy at European level. Member States still lack a shared vision in this area. In addition, the lack of visibility of national, regional and local initiatives in this area makes it more difficult to foster European networks. Consequently, for the moment, there is no coordination between stakeholders.      Challenges      Media literacy should enable European citizens to better understand and analyse the media messages and content they encounter and to acquire the skills which will enable them to play their role of citizen fully.     It may also contribute to safeguarding the pluralism and independence of the media. It permits the expression of diverse opinions from different social groups and promotes the development of the values of tolerance and dialogue.     Media literacy also plays an important role in enhancing awareness of the European audiovisual heritage and cultural identities. In fact, it helps to increase knowledge of and interest in recent European cultural works.     Faced with these challenges, the European Commission proposes encouraging research projects on media literacy in the framework of existing programmes.      Recommended action      Member States are invited to develop and implement co-regulatory initiatives leading to the adoption of codes of conduct relating to the European media.     It is important to promote and finance research, studies and projects covering the different aspects and dimensions of media literacy in the digital environment.     Member States are also encouraged to organise debates in conferences and public events with a view to the inclusion of media literacy in the education curriculum and as part of the provision of key competences for lifelong learning.     Member States should also implement national campaigns to raise public awareness of cultural heritage, as well as training to raise awareness of the risks involved in processing personal data through information and communication networks.     Moreover, the Media Industry is invited to suggest tools for improving the level of media literacy, such as:      information tools relating to digital content and search engines;       awareness-raising campaigns about techniques used for commercial communication purposes (product placement and online advertising);       information packs for young people on the processing of personal data;       information days on the creative economy and copyright.       Background      The Commission Communication of December 2007 on ‘       A European approach to media literacy in the digital environment      ’ emphasised the importance of media literacy in relation to commercial communication, audiovisual works and digital content. A better level of media literacy would contribute towards the objectives that the European Union set for itself in Lisbon and in the context of       the i2010 initiative      .

   Thematic strategy on the urban environment     Thematic strategy on the urban environment     The EU sets out cooperation measures and guidelines aimed at improving the urban environment. The measures essentially concern the exchange of experience and the circulation of information at the most appropriate levels in order to ensure that legislation is implemented effectively and that best practices are promoted within local authorities.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 11 January 2006 on a thematic strategy on the urban environment [       COM(2005) 718      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The EU sets out cooperation measures and guidelines aimed at the Member States and the local authorities in order to enable them to improve urban environmental management in Europe.     The aim of this strategy is to improve the quality of the urban environment by making cities more attractive and healthier places in which to live, work and invest, and by reducing their adverse environmental impact.     The main measures proposed in the strategy are as follows:      publication of guidelines for the integration of environmental issues into urban policies. The guidelines will be based on best practice and expert advice. Integrated environmental management will make it possible to improve planning and avoid conflicts between the different measures;       publication of guidelines for sustainable urban transport plans. The guidelines will be based on best practice and expert advice. Effective transport planning should embrace both passengers and goods and promote safe and efficient use of less polluting, high-quality modes;       support for the exchange of best practices, e.g. through the networking of information, the development of demonstration projects funded by         LIFE+        , and the establishment of a network of national focal points;       broadening the range of information for local authorities via the Internet and of training on urban management issues for people working in regional and local government;       drawing on the Community support programmes in the context of cohesion policy or research.      The cross-cutting nature of urban management issues means that any strategy for improving the urban environment needs to be coordinated with the other environmental policies concerned. including climate change policy (sustainable construction to improve energy efficiency, urban transport plans, etc.), protection of nature and biodiversity (reducing urban sprawl, converting industrial wastelands, etc.), quality of life and health (reducing air pollution and noise, etc.), sustainable use of natural resources and prevention and recycling of waste.      Context      Four out five Europeans live in urban areas. They share the same problems: poor air quality, high levels of traffic and congestion, very high levels of ambient noise, poor-quality built environment, derelict land, greenhouse gas emissions, urban sprawl, and waste and sewage disposal.     These are highly complex problems, and the causes are inter-related, which is why an integrated approach is needed. Given the wide variety of urban areas and existing obligations, which call for tailor-made solutions, together with the difficulties encountered in setting common urban environmental standards, guidelines and coordination measures are more appropriate instruments than legislation. This strategy is therefore based on subsidiarity, giving priority to local initiatives while promoting cooperation between the different levels of decision-making (Community, national and local) and interweaving the various strands of urban management.     The urban environment strategy is one of the seven thematic strategies mentioned in the       Sixth Environment Action Programme      .     RELATED ACTS      Commission Communication of 11 February 2004 "Towards a thematic strategy on the urban environment" [         COM(2004) 60 final        - Official Journal C 98, 23.04.2004].      By means of a European strategy for the urban environment, the EU intends to reinforce the contribution of environmental policy to the sustainable development of urban areas, notably by focusing measures around four themes: urban management, transport, construction and urban design.       Decision No 1411/2001/EC        of the European Parliament and of the Council on a Community framework for cooperation to promote sustainable urban development [Official Journal L 191 of 13.07.2001].

   Consumer access to basic payment accounts     Consumer access to basic payment accounts     Access to basic payment accounts by European consumers should be guaranteed in all European Union (EU) countries. To this end, the Commission presents the general principles which should guide the provision of this type of financial service.     ACT     Commission Recommendation       2011/442/EU      of 18 July 2011 on access to a basic payment account (Text with EEA relevance) [OJ L 190 of 21.7.2011].     SUMMARY     European consumers who do not have a payment account should be able to open and use a       basic payment account      , irrespective of their financial situation or their place of residence in the European Union (EU). The Commission therefore recommends that at least one payment service provider       *      offers this service in each Member State.      Characteristics of a basic payment account      The payment services offered must enable as a minimum:      all the operations required for the opening, operating and closing of a payment account to be carried out;       money to be placed on a payment account;       cash withdrawals from a payment account;       execution of payment transactions, by credit transfers or by transfers of funds, including through a payment card (however, without the possibility of becoming overdrawn).      Access to a basic payment account should not be made conditional on the purchase of additional services.      Charges associated with a basic payment account      Member States should ensure that the basic payment account is provided either free of charge or at a reasonable charge. Where the provision is not free of charge, the total amount of charges for using the minimum payment services should be reasonable.     In all cases, all other charges provided for in the account contract should be reasonable, including those applied where consumers do not meet their contractual obligations.     The amount of charges to the consumer should be calculated according to the:      national income levels and consumer prices;       average charges associated with payment accounts in the Member State concerned;       total costs relating to the provision of the basic payment account.       Supervision and dispute resolution      Member States should designate competent authorities independent from payment service providers to monitor compliance with these recommendations.     In addition, they should ensure that complaint and redress procedures are put in place in the event of disputes.      Consumer information      If a service provider rejects an application to open an account, it must provide a justification for its refusal and inform the consumer in writing. However, limitations to this right to information may be made by legislative measures on the grounds of national security or public order.     Service providers must provide sufficient information on the specific features of the accounts offered, the associated charges and their conditions of use.     Member States should organise public awareness-raising campaigns concerning the options offered by basic payment accounts, pricing conditions and the options for of       out-of-court proceedings      in the event of disputes.       Key terms         Payment service providers: specifically organisations which can be credit, payment or electronic money institutions or post office giro institutions.

   Cohesion policy to deliver the Lisbon Strategy (2007-2013)     Cohesion policy to deliver the Lisbon Strategy (2007-2013)     The Commission gives an overview of the strategies and national programmes in the field of cohesion policy for the period 2007-2013. It shows that most of the 347 billion euro earmarked for this policy will be invested in the priorities of the Lisbon strategy, namely: the knowledge-based economy, research, development and innovation, human capital and business development.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 11 December 2007 – Member States and Regions delivering the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs through EU cohesion policy, 2007-2013 [       COM(2007) 798      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The Commission sets out an initial overview of the results of the negotiations relating to the       new generation of cohesion      programmes and strategies. It looks at the part which these can play in the       renewed Lisbon strategy      .     This Communication is part of the package defining the actions taken by the European Union to achieve the Lisbon objectives for 2008-2011. It assesses the progress made towards achieving the objectives of this strategy in the period 2005-2007.      Cohesion policy at the heart of the Lisbon process      Since its reform in 2006, cohesion policy has focused on the achievement of the priorities of the Lisbon strategy for the period 2007-2013, namely: making the EU an attractive place to invest and work, encouraging innovation, entrepreneurship and growth of the knowledge economy, and creating more and better jobs.     The reformed cohesion policy has brought about the decentralisation of responsibilities to local and regional partners, the pooling of their knowledge and resources, and the development of strategies suited to local and regional levels.     The efforts to achieve the Lisbon objectives must continue, taking account of the variability of contexts and the difficulties facing each country. For instance, the Member States are required to provide funding for actions which achieve these objectives and for the structural reforms set out in the National Reform Programmes (NRPs).      Focusing on the Lisbon priorities      For 2007-2013, the budget for cohesion policy amounts to 347 billion euro, with an additional 160 billion euro from public and private national resources. Around 80 % of these resources will be allocated to regions under the Convergence objective: 65 % of these funds will be used for the Lisbon strategy. Regions under the Regional Competitiveness and Employment Objective will account for 16 % of cohesion policy resources, 82 % of which will be used for actions linked to the Lisbon strategy.     Efforts will focus on the four priorities of the Lisbon strategy, namely:      investing more in knowledge and innovation;       unlocking business potential (particularly of SMEs);       improving employability through         flexicurity        ;       better management of energy resources.       Investing in knowledge and innovation      The cohesion programmes invest 85 billion euro in knowledge and innovation, in particular in order to improve the innovation capacity of businesses (49.5 billion euro) and skills, to disseminate, use and design technologies, to create businesses and promote a more flexible workforce.     In this field, it is important to exploit existing poles of excellence, improve national and regional capacities, leverage private financing and draw on existing potential. This can be done through joint action to launch a new generation of world-class infrastructures, laboratories and research instruments.      Unlocking business potential      Cohesion policy helps small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to invest in human capital, install efficient management systems, offer a good working environment, anticipate economic change and reduce administrative formalities.     For 2007-2013, almost 19 billion euro are allocated to helping SMEs improve their competitiveness and gain access to the world markets. Thanks to the JEREMIE and JESSICA initiatives, which seek to improve the availability of innovative financial engineering products in the regions, SMEs can also have access to other sources of aid.     The JASMINE initiative has been adopted in the field of supporting micro-credit, in order to develop employment and boost social inclusion. A Communication proposing guidance on the synergies between cohesion policy, the Research Framework Programmes and the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme has also been issued.      Improving employability through flexicurity      For the period 2007-2013, around 50 billion euro have been allocated under cohesion policy to financing various aspects of flexicurity. The aim of the new programmes is to improve employability through flexicurity by helping businesses to develop human resources strategies and more productive working methods and to ease the transition process resulting from restructuring.     Labour market and education and training policies ensure the provision of the necessary skills and qualifications for the world of work. Funding earmarked for the reform of education and training systems will be increased (25.3 billion euro).      Better management of energy resources      The new programmes attach greater importance to improving the management of energy resources and the move towards an efficient and integrated energy policy. Compared to the period 2000-2006, investments in renewable energies and energy efficiency will be five times higher for the Convergence objective and seven times higher for the Regional Competitiveness and Employment objective.      Addressing recommendations and priorities      Investments to further the achievement of the Lisbon objectives affect a number of fields, the complexity of which could lead to difficulties for the Member States. In order to deal with this, 51 billion euro are earmarked for programmes which aim to strengthen synergies between environmental protection, risk prevention and growth.     A suitable transport network is needed for economic development. Priority is given to the development of Trans-European Transport Networks (       TEN-T      ), with a budget of 38 billion euro. Projects which facilitate access to TEN-T and promote more environmentally-friendly transport systems will benefit from 34 billion euro.     Almost 3.6 billion euro will be used to help modernise public administrations and services and allow them to develop and implement effective policies. The JASPERS technical assistance facility will also help the new Member States to implement quality projects likely to receive EU financial support.      Promoting partnerships      Overall, there is good cooperation between those responsible for coordinating the implementation of the NRPs (National Reform Programmes) and those developing strategies and programmes for cohesion policy. Efforts must continue to be made where this is not yet the case.     All stakeholders must cooperate intensively for the preparation and implementation of cohesion policy programmes. Cohesion policy associates both "vertical" partners (Community, national, regional and local authorities) and "horizontal" stakeholders (business representatives, trade unions, NGOs, etc.).      Evaluation and monitoring of cohesion policy in the Lisbon process      Regular reports on the contribution of cohesion policy to the improvement of growth and employment are presented for the purpose of cross-checking and to guarantee the coherent management of the NRPs and cohesion policy programmes.     The Member States will submit a report each year on the aid allocated to each programme in addition to reports in 2009 and 2012 on the contribution of cohesion policy to the Lisbon agenda.     The Commission will draft a report (in 2010 and 2013) on national contributions and the need to adjust the programmes to the new challenges.     RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 14 May 2008 on the results of the negotiations concerning cohesion policy strategies and programmes for the programming period 2007-2013 [         COM(2008) 301        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      Following the       negotiations      conducted with the Member States, the Commission presents the priorities of cohesion policy programming for 2007-2013. In line with the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, the financial resources allocated to the Convergence, Competitiveness and Territorial Cooperation Objectives support innovation, research, skills and human capital.     The regional and sectoral strategies have been adapted to new challenges. For example, investments should contribute to the global competitiveness of European businesses by facilitating their access to the markets and by helping them to deal with restructuring. The ageing of the population and demographic changes in European society call in particular for increased labour participation and enhanced workers’ skills. Cohesion policy is aimed in particular at the inclusion of migrants and the fight against discrimination, poverty and exclusion. The programmes support the development of new environmental services and new skills, as well as the financing of infrastructure, in order to achieve the European objectives in the areas of sustainable development, climate change and energy policy.     The decentralised management of the Funds is essential to the effectiveness of the programmes. The multi-level partnership introduced between the public authorities and civil society in the preparation of strategies also makes it possible to adapt investment more closely to regional and local situations. In addition, exchanges of good practices based on previous programming contribute towards the effectiveness of public spending.     Good practices are spread within the framework of the Community initiatives, particularly the new “       Regions for Economic Change      ” initiative and the Territorial Cooperation Objective.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 2271/96  protecting against the effects of the extra-territorial application of legislation adopted by a non-EU country   what is the aim of the regulation  It aims to protect the economic and/or financial interests of individuals or legal entities against the extra-territorial effects of legislation adopted by non-EU countries.   key points   The laws covered by the regulation are specified in its  annex  . The  protection  concerns:   international trade; and/or   the movement of capital; and   related commercial activities between the EU and non-EU countries.   The regulation applies to:   any individual who is a resident in the EU and a national of an EU country;   any legal entity incorporated within the EU;   nationals of EU countries who are established outside the EU and shipping companies established outside the EU and controlled by nationals of an EU country (for example a French person working in a Dutch-owned shipping company in a non-EU country), if their vessels are registered in that country in accordance with its legislation;   individuals who are a resident in the EU, unless that person is in the country of which he or she is a national;   any other individual within the EU, including its territorial waters and airspace and in any aircraft or on any vessel under the jurisdiction or control of an EU country, acting in a professional capacity.   Any person whose economic and financial interests are affected by foreign legislation must inform the  European Commission  within 30 days. This 30-day period runs from the date on which the person obtained this information.  If a court or tribunal or an administrative authority located outside the EU handed down a decision giving effect, directly or indirectly, to the laws specified in the annex (such as the US’s ‘Iran Sanctions Act of 1996’), this decision would not be recognised or enforceable in any manner. The persons referred to in this regulation shall not comply with any requirement or prohibition based on the laws specified in the annex. Nonetheless, a person may be authorised to comply fully or partially with the said requirements or prohibitions to the extent that non-compliance would seriously damage their interests or those of the EU. This authorisation is granted by the Commission, which is assisted by a committee composed of representatives of the EU countries.  The EU countries determine the sanctions to be imposed in the event of a breach of any relevant provisions of this regulation.   Amendments to the regulation   Regulation (EU) No  37/2014  empowers the Commission to adopt  delegated acts  . It also states that Regulation (EC) No 2271/96 requires uniform conditions for establishing criteria for the authorisation of persons to comply fully or partially with any requirement or prohibition, including requests of foreign courts, in cases where non-compliance would seriously damage their interests or those of the EU. Those measures should be adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. (  Committees’ role in European Commission’s implementing powers  ).  Delegated Regulation (EU)  2018/1100  amends the annex to take into account the fact that in May 2018, the US announced they will no longer waive their national restrictive measures relating to Iran. Some of those measures have extra-territorial effect and may have adverse consequences for the interests of the EU and the interests of natural and legal persons engaged in economic activities with Iran.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 29 November 1996.
summary of   Council Directive 92/104/EEC — safety and health protection of workers in the surface and underground extractive industries   summary    what does this directive do  It lays down minimum requirements for the safety and health protection of workers in mineral-extracting industries.   key points   The Directive covers  surface and underground mineral-extracting industries  , including prospecting, and the preparation of extracted materials for sale. It does not cover the subsequent processing of the materials extracted.  To safeguard the  safety and health of workers  , the employer ensures that:        —     workplaces are designed and organised in such a way that workers can work without endangering the health and safety of themselves or other workers,            —     there should always be supervision by a person in charge,            —     work involving a special risk is given only to competent staff and carried out according to instructions,            —     safety instructions are comprehensible to all the workers concerned;            —     first-aid facilities are provided, and            —     safety drills are performed regularly.      A  safety and health document  must be drawn up by the employer responsible for the implementation of all the safety and health measures showing that the risks to which workers are exposed have been assessed, and that the workplace is safe. Where workers from other companies are present, the document should also outline the aims of coordination and implementation procedures.  The employer will also:        —     report serious  occupational accidents  and situations of serious danger to the competent authorities without delay,            —     take measures to  prevent, detect and combat fires  , and the occurrence of explosive or other health-endangering atmospheres,            —     provide  means of escape  and rescue in the event of danger,            —     provide warning and other  communication systems  to enable assistance, escape and rescue operations,            —      inform workers  of measures taken concerning  safety and health at the workplace  ,            —     ensure that workers undergo  regular health checks  related to their activities,            —     ensure the  consultation and participation  of workers on safety and health matters.      Detailed requirements are set out in the Annexes to the Directive.   when does this directive apply  It entered into force on 7 December 1992.   background    Health and safety at work: Areas of activity on the European Commission’s website  .   act   Council Directive  92/104/EEC  of 3 December 1992 on the minimum requirements for improving the safety and health protection of workers in surface and underground mineral-extractive industries (twelfth individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC)   REFERENCES           Act     Entry into force     Deadline for transposition in the Member States     Official Journal       Directive  92/104/EEC      7.12.1992     7.12.1994      OJ L 404, 31.12.1992, pp. 10–25                Amending act(s)     Entry into force     Deadline for transposition in the Member States     Official Journal       Directive  2007/30/EC      28.6.2007     31.12.2012      OJ L 165, 27.6.2007, pp. 21–24
   Copyright in the Knowledge Economy     Copyright in the Knowledge Economy     Technical progress has made information more accessible, in particular through the Internet. For this reason, it is now necessary to adapt the legal framework for copyright to recent technological developments. This Communication therefore examines possible avenues for future action concerning the digitisation of works, the processing of orphan works, access for persons with disabilities and the protection of new creators of online content.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 19 October 2009 - Copyright in the Knowledge Economy [       COM(2009) 532      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     After having analysed the responses generated by the       Green Paper on Copyright in the Knowledge Economy      , in this Communication the European Commission announces a series of actions to be implemented in the area of intellectual property rights.      What are the positions of the different stakeholders concerned?      The Commission collected 372 responses from the consultation launched by the Green Paper. The analysis of the responses shows radically opposed positions among the following key stakeholders:       archives, libraries and universities        favour a wider-ranging copyright system, as well as a system of “public interest” exceptions to facilitate access to works;        publishers, collecting societies and other right-holders        favour the status quo as regards copyright, and prefer contracts which can be adapted to each case and which take account of new technologies.       What is the Commission's strategy in terms of copyright?       Libraries and archives       Digital copies      and       electronic dissemination      of digitised works represent the two main challenges for libraries and archives. Currently, the digitisation of a library collection is subject to prior approval from right-holders, and the dissemination of works online can only be performed on library premises.     The Commission therefore intends to continue working at European level towards clarifying the legal implications of mass-scale digitisation and providing solutions to the issue of transaction costs for right clearance.      Orphan Works       Orphan works      are works that are in copyright but whose right-holders cannot be identified or located. They cannot be exploited because it is       impossible to obtain prior permission from the right-holders      . Consequently, these works cannot be included in digitisation projects such as the       Europeana      library. Although the Commission published a       Recommendation on the online digitisation of cultural material      in 2006, and the Memorandum of Understanding on Orphan Works in 2008, there is no binding legal framework in this field at present.     The Commission plans to launch an impact assessment to explore a variety of approaches to facilitate the digitisation and dissemination of orphan works. Several options are being considered, including a legally binding stand-alone instrument on the clearance and mutual recognition of orphan works (this would be an exception to the provisions of       Directive 2001/29/EC      ), or guidance on cross-border mutual recognition of orphan works.      Teaching and research      Enabled by new information and communication technologies, teaching and research is already widely internationalised. It is therefore important that copyright on books and publications does not hinder the development of these sectors. To this end, different processes in       scientific publishing      and       publishing for literary and artistic aims      are being envisaged. Furthermore, the Commission proposes to facilitate the acquisition and use of material for scientific research. Currently, the system is based on licence agreements concluded with publishers. The Commission wishes to consolidate best practice in this field in order to achieve a less fragmented system of usage rights to journals.      Persons with disabilities      The       United Nations Convention on the rights of Persons with Disabilities      stipulates that these persons have a fundamental right to enjoy       equal access to information products, publications and cultural material in an accessible format      . However, persons with disabilities have very limited access to these works for the moment (5 % of books published in Europe are converted into accessible formats). Moreover, the cross-border transfer of this type of material is hampered by the territorial limitation of copyright exceptions under national legislation.     The Commission’s main goal is to encourage publishers to make more works accessible to disabled persons. In this regard, the organisation of a forum bringing together the stakeholders concerned will foster solutions to give persons with disabilities better access to works while ensuring that right-holders are adequately remunerated for the use of their work.      User-created content (UCC)      With the development of Internet applications, users can now       produce      and       share      text, videos and pictures or       create content      , sometimes using copyright-protected material.     However, this phenomenon of content creation by Internet users is still quite recent. For this reason, the Commission intends to analyse the needs of this type of user further with regard to protecting their rights.     Last updated: 09.07.2010  
act   Directive  98/26/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 1998 on settlement finality in payment and securities settlement systems.   summary    what does this directive do  It guarantees that financial product transfer and payment orders can be finalised, mainly by mitigating problems arising from a participant’s insolvency. These participants may be:   financial institutions, e.g. banks;   systems operators, such as central securities depositories.   key points    Transfer orders are irrevocable   Transfer orders of financial products are contractually enforceable. This is also applicable to any associated payment netting, situations where debt and claims are offset between participants.  The rules apply even when a participant is subject to insolvency proceedings, as long as the transfer order was underway before the proceedings started. The rules may also apply up to 24 hours afterwards to cover situations where transactions are entered into at times when relevant records are unavailable, for instance overnight.   Uniform rules   The directive seeks to ensure that uniform rules are applied where multiple settlement and payment systems are in operation from the moment the transactions are entered into in order to avoid difficulties arising from incompatible regulations.   Guarantees in insolvency situations   The existence of insolvency proceedings against a participant does not retroactively affect the rights and obligations of other participants nor their access to the normal financial guarantees inherent in a transaction.   when does the directive apply  It originally took effect in 1998, since when it has been amended several times.

   Council Resolution on eLearning     Council Resolution on eLearning     The aim of this resolution is to encourage European Union (EU) countries and the Commission to undertake initiatives to facilitate the integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) in education and training.     ACT     Council Resolution of 13 July 2001 on       eLearning      [Official Journal C 204 of 20.07.2001].     SUMMARY     The Stockholm European Council (23-24 March 2001) reaffirmed that improving basic skills, particularly information technology (IT) skills, is a top priority for the European Union (EU).      Actions required of EU countries and the Commission      The resolution calls on EU countries to:      continue their efforts concerning the effective integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) in education and training systems and the initial and in-service training of teachers and trainers;       capitalise on the potential of the Internet, multimedia and virtual lifelong learning environments;       speed up the integration of ICT and the revision of school and higher education curricula;       encourage those in charge of schools to integrate and manage ICT effectively;       ensure more rapid provision of equipment and of a quality infrastructure for education and training;       encourage the development of high-quality digital teaching and learning materials to ensure the quality of resources available online;       take advantage of the opportunities offered by ICT for facilitating access to cultural resources, such as libraries, museums and archives;       support the development and adaptation of innovative teaching that incorporates the use of technologies;       take advantage of the communication potential offered by ICT to foster European awareness;       support virtual forums for cooperation and exchange of information;       capitalise on the experience gained from initiatives such as         European School Net        and European Network of Teacher Education Policies;       foster the European dimension of the joint development of higher education curricula;       enhance research in eLearning;       promote partnerships between the public and private sectors;       monitor and analyse the process of integration and the use of ICT in teaching.      This resolution also invites the Commission to:      pay particular attention to the implementation of the         eLearning action plan        and to the         concrete future objectives of education and training systems        ;       support existing European portals in order to promote collaboration and exchange of experiences in the area of eLearning and pedagogical development;       implement support actions at European level to ensure that experiences are shared, to establish cross-border links and to encourage information and communication measures;       consider together with EU countries whether the eSchola initiative could develop into an ongoing activity;       support the testing of new learning environments and approaches;       undertake strategic studies on innovative approaches in education;       intensify research, experimentation and evaluation relating to the pedagogical, socio-economic and technological dimensions of ICT;       support the development of European multilingual educational resources, platforms and services;       report to the Council on the results of these activities no later than December 2002. An interim report shall also be presented to the Council in November 2001.       Background      The institutions' interest in new technologies indicates that the importance of these technologies is increasing. Since the       Lisbon European Council      (23-24 March 2000), which set the strategic goal of creating a competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy and specific objectives relating to ICT and education, several initiatives have been taken: the       2001 employment guidelines      , the resolution relating to educational multimedia software, the communication on       eLearning      and the eLearning action plan. More recently, the Stockholm Council (23-24 March 2001) reaffirmed that improving basic skills, particularly IT skills, is a top priority for the EU.

act   Council Directive  93/15/EEC  of 5 April 1993 on the harmonization of the provisions relating to the placing on the market and supervision of explosives for civil uses [  See amending acts  ].   summary   This Directive concerns the placing on the market and supervision of explosives for civilian use. It does not apply to:        —     explosives, including ammunition, intended for military or police use;            —     pyrotechnic articles.       Placing on the market and CE marking   Explosives for civilian use may be placed on the market only if they comply with the essential safety requirements set out in the Directive.  Explosives which fall within the scope of this Directive may be placed on the market only if they:        —     comply with all provisions of the Directive;            —     have been assessed regarding their conformity with the essential safety requirements;            —     have the  ‘CE’marking  affixed to them.      Where an EU country establishes that an explosive bearing CE conformity marking and being used for its intended purpose may compromise safety, it shall take all interim measures necessary to withdraw the explosive from the market or prohibit its being placed on the market or its freedom of movement.   Essential requirements   Any explosive must be designed, manufactured and supplied in such a way as to present a minimal risk to the safety of human life and health, and to prevent damage to property and the environment.   Supervision of transfers of explosives   Approval to transfer explosives must be obtained by the consignee from the recipient competent authority. The competent authority verifies that the consignee is legally authorised to acquire explosives and that he is in possession of the necessary licences or authorisations. The person responsible for the transfer must notify the competent authorities of the transit EU country or countries of movements of explosives through this State or these States.   Harmonised standards and notified bodies   Explosives falling within the scope of this Directive which comply with the European harmonized standards are considered to be in conformity with the essential safety requirements.   Conformity assessment   The Directive lays down different procedures for assessing the conformity of explosives for civilian use with the essential requirements, to be followed at the choice of the manufacturer. EU countries inform the Commission of the bodies which they have appointed to carry out the procedures for assessing conformity.   Repeal   Directive  2014/28/EU  repeals Directive 93/15/EC with effect from 19 April 2016.

   Joint EU resettlement programme     Joint EU resettlement programme     This communication proposes a joint EU resettlement programme in order to improve European action in the international protection of refugees and to show solidarity with third countries. The purpose is to devise a strategic approach to resettlement by integrating it into EU external policy actions, and to streamline efforts to make them more cost-effective.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council of 2 September 2009 on the establishment of a joint EU resettlement programme [       COM(2009) 447      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The communication concerns the resettlement of refugees from outside the European Union (EU) to one of the Member States. Resettlement is one of the durable solutions offered to refugees, whose needs for protection have already been established. The United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) usually acts as an intermediary in the resettlement process. The communication also addresses solidarity in migration management and EU protection to refugees worldwide.     Currently several Member States participate in resettlement on an annual or on an       ad hoc      basis. The       European Refugee Fund      (ERF) provides significant financial support to resettlement-related activities.     Nevertheless, the number of refugees resettled in the EU remains rather low and most Member States lack resettlement programmes. Furthermore, the Member States that are resettlement countries mostly set their priorities at the national level, instead of coordinating resettlement and the related external policy instruments at the EU level. In addition, the current ERF is not adaptable enough to respond to new and changing needs concerning resettlement. Consequently, joint EU action should aim at:      involving more Member States and enhancing their cooperation;       providing refugees a secure access to protection;       expressing solidarity towards third countries;       making better use of resettlement at the EU level;       integrating resettlement into EU external policies;       providing a financial incentive for Member States to resettle based on jointly defined key priorities.      A       joint EU resettlement programme      should be established to fully integrate resettlement in the external dimension of the EU's asylum policy and improve its strategic use. The Communication provides the following       guiding principles      :      participation in resettlement should be voluntary for Member States;       EU resettlement activities should be extended;       the programme should be incremental and adaptable to changing circumstances;       all stakeholders should be able to participate (international and local NGOs, local authorities, etc.).      The main       components      of the programme will be the setting of common annual priorities on the basis of a consultative process and financial assistance by the ERF to Member States that "pledge" to resettle refugees according to these priorities. This will allow the financial assistance to be used more effectively. The existing resettlement expert group that meets on an       ad hoc      basis will be transformed into a permanent body in which all Member States and stakeholders will participate. It will carry out preparatory work for identifying the common annual priorities for the EU, exchange information on Member States’ quantitative targets and assess the specific resettlement needs. The UNHCR will be closely involved in the preparatory work by providing an assessment of worldwide resettlement needs. The common annual priorities will subsequently be established by a Commission decision using the comitology procedure. They will focus on specific geographic regions, nationalities or categories of refugees, and provide for more flexibility to respond to new or urgent needs. Consequently, financial assistance under the ERF will be available to Member States resettling refugees on the basis of the common priorities.     The programme will provide for enhanced practical cooperation and improve the effectiveness of EU external asylum policies. The       European Asylum Support Office      (EASO), which will be established in 2010 to strengthen Member State practical cooperation on asylum, will play an active role in coordinating resettlement activities. The Commission will also continue to support practical cooperation projects relating to resettlement through the ERF. As part of the programme, cooperation with the UNHCR will also be intensified to identify common priorities, maximise the strategic use of resettlement, and develop and carry out practical cooperation activities. Resettlement should form an integral part of EU external asylum policies and be well coordinated with external policies as a whole. In particular, it should be consistent with the       EU Global Approach to Migration      . The aim is also to integrate resettlement into the future Regional Protection Programmes (RPPs).     With the support of the EASO, the Commission will annually report on resettlement progress in the EU. In addition, a mid-term evaluation will be carried out in 2012 with all relevant stakeholders. In 2014, the joint programme will be evaluated with a view to developing it further.      Background      Resettlement has been identified as an integral element in the establishment of the       Common European Asylum System      (CEAS), as reiterated in the European pact on immigration and asylum. In its       policy plan on asylum      , the Commission called for the further development of resettlement as an instrument to protect refugees.     Last updated: 11.12.2009

It relates only to the external surfaces and does not apply to external rear-view mirrors or accessories such as radio aerials or luggage racks.     EC vehicle type-approval is applied for by the vehicle manufacturer or his representative.     The manufacturer or his representative must provide various documents, notably a description of the type of vehicle.     EC type-approval is granted if the vehicle satisfies the requirements for ornaments and headlamp visors and rims.     Any alteration to the type of vehicle or its external projections must be notified to the administrative department which issued the vehicle's type-approval.     Member States may not refuse EC type-approval or national type-approval of a vehicle type, or refuse or prohibit the sale, registration, entry into service or use of a vehicle on grounds relating to the external projections forward of the rear panel of the vehicle's cab, if these vehicles satisfy the requirements of the Directive.

   Strategy for the eastern region 2007-2013     Strategy for the eastern region 2007-2013     The regional strategy document for the Eastern Region identifies the cross-cutting challenges to which a regional response can be provided through new or complementary measures and instruments provided by the European Union. The countries concerned are Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine and Russia.     ACT     European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument – Eastern Regional Programme – Strategy Paper 2007-2013 (       pdf      ).     SUMMARY     The regional strategy paper (RSP) defines the objectives and priorities for regional cooperation on the basis of the       European neighbourhood and partnership instrument      (ENPI) for the period 2007-2013. In this respect, it supplements the       country strategy papers      (CSPs) established for each country in the region (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine and Russia).     The RSP contributes to the achievement of the objectives of the       European neighbourhood policy      (ENP) with partner countries and of the       Four Common Spaces      with Russia, in addition to bilateral relations between the European Union (EU) and these countries. Within this context, regional cooperation concerns the challenges that are of common interest for all the countries and that have a cross-border nature.     Moreover, this regional support is justified by its added value or the need for joint intervention by several countries in order to solve cross-border issues. Thus, the willingness of the partner countries to cooperate on a regional basis and to embrace this cooperation is fundamental.     Regional cooperation in a number of sectors will also support further economic and regulatory integration with the EU.      Common challenges for partner countries      The Eastern Region groups a number of countries that share a common past but that are pursuing their own transition process. These countries are facing similar political, economic, social and environmental challenges.     The       indicative programme (IP) for the period 2007-2010      (       pdf      ) covers a specific number of priorities set in consultation with partner countries. They have been chosen for their strategic importance, their comparative advantage and their complementarity at regional level, and also for their coherence with EU policies in this area.      Transport and energy, and in particular networks in these sectors      , constitute an essential priority given that the countries in the region are both producer countries and transit countries. Assistance is based on experience acquired under the       TRACECA      and       INOGATE      programmes. It includes the following:      transport safety, in particular gradual approximation with EU standards, and also development of sustainable transport;       energy supply diversity and safety, and the promotion of renewable sources of energy;       development of links and networks between the EU and its neighbours in order to strengthen trade relations in particular.       Protection of the environment and forests and the fight against climate change      are of critical importance for the IP. Air and water quality, waste management, the protection of nature and soils, and industrial pollution will be given special attention, as will pollution of the Baltic, Barents, Caspian and Black Seas. Increased awareness and involvement of civil society and the private sector are necessary to support efforts undertaken in this area.      Border and migration management, the fight against cross-border organised crime and customs at regional level      will create economies of scale on account of their cross-border nature. Specifically, the EU supports measures against human trafficking, corruption and terrorism at national and international level.     Moreover,       people-to people activities and information and support      will benefit from assistance in order to stimulate cooperation between civil society and EU partner countries.     Finally,       landmines, explosive remnants of war, small arms and light weapons      constitute a serious threat for civilians and for the environment. As a consequence of former or “frozen” conflicts, many countries are confronted with the presence of anti-personnel landmines and other remnants of war. In addition, sustained assistance and clear action strategies are essential in this area.      Instruments and means      Several instruments and measures will support the achievement of these priorities. The ENPI is the main instrument and includes the following:      national allocations focused on the strategic priorities of beneficiary countries;       cross-border cooperation (CBC) and Neighbourhood and Partnership Programmes (NPP), which are intended to promote cross-border cooperation between beneficiary countries, the EU, candidate countries and potential candidate countries;       the Interregional Programme, whose activities will be implemented consistently in all neighbouring countries (         TAIEX        ,         Tempus        ,         SIGMA        , etc.);       thematic programmes under the new instruments such as democracy and human rights, migration and asylum, non-state actors and local authorities, environment and use of natural resources or even energy.      Moreover, other instruments will or can also be used.      the         Democracy and Human Rights Instrument        ;       the         Nuclear Safety Instrument        supporting improvements in nuclear safety (power stations, waste management, etc.);       the         Stability Instrument        aimed at providing an effective response to existing or emerging crises or continued political instability (“frozen” conflicts).      At the same time, the use of interest-rate subsidies can leverage investments by various international financing institutions in the areas of the environment, energy and transport.      Background      In accordance with the objectives of its external policy, the EU promotes prosperity, solidarity, security and sustainable development throughout the world as well as democracy and human rights. The ENP launched after the fifth enlargement pursues these objectives while insisting on relations of good neighbourliness between the EU and its neighbours. For this, the ENPI, the ENP financial instrument for the period 2007-2013, supports ENP partner countries and Russia by integrating the regional and cross-border dimension and by pursuing the objectives identified by the previous Tacis programme.     RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council of 3 December 2008 – Eastern Partnership [         COM(2008) 823        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      The Commission presents proposals aimed at strengthening the EU’s commitment to its eastern neighbours. This regional partnership should lead to the conclusion of association agreements. It should also support the acceleration of economic reforms, political dialogue and multilateralism, in particular through a comprehensive institution-building programme.     The deepening of bilateral relations should take place within the framework of:      the gradual establishing of a free trade area with the EU, supplemented progressively by free trade agreements between the partner countries;       cooperation on energy, considering the existing interdependent trade relations between the EU and its partners;       the introduction of “mobility and security pacts”, differentiated by country, outlining both a progressive liberalisation of the visa policy and an intensification of the fight against illegal immigration;       the development of economic and social policies at local, regional and cross-border levels.      The partnership should be based on a new multilateral framework. Implemented through four thematic platforms, it aims at developing cooperation and dialogue in the following areas:      democracy, the rule of law, good governance, stability and territorial integrity;       economic integration and regulatory convergence with the EU;       the environment;       the interconnection of transport and information networks;       energy security, in particular through warning mechanisms, the diversification of supply and transit routes;       culture and contacts between people.      Specific initiatives are also planned concerning good border management, small and medium enterprises, renewable energies and the response to natural or man-made disasters.     The Commission proposes an overall increase in the funding granted to eastern partners under the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI). It invites Member States to increase their direct contributions Neighbourhood Investment Facility (NIF).     This new initiative for eastern partnership should be launched at the “Eastern Partnership Meeting” in spring 2009.     Last updated: 30.10.2009

It is on the basis of this definition (given in Article 1) that the Financial Regulation goes on to      shape the European Union's financial architecture step by step. Subsequent articles of the Regulation introduce the key concepts underlying the budget and lay down the procedures and rules for its establishment and implementation. The main features of the Financial Regulation are summarised below. More detailed questions can be answered by referring to the text of the Regulation itself.      I. European budgetary law in 16 definitions       The financial year      : The financial year runs for 12 months from 1 January to 31 December. The budget comprises all expenditure and revenue authorised for that year. The appropriations entered in the budget are authorised only for the duration of one financial year.       (See point 12 - Carryover of appropriations).       Differentiated appropriations      : One of the principles governing the Community's financial system is annuality. This means that operations relate to a given financial year, making it easier to control the work of the Community executive. However, multiannual operations are often necessary (e.g. research programmes, structural measures, etc), in which case the notion of differentiated appropriations is used. Differentiated appropriations, as opposed to non-differentiated appropriations, are split into commitment appropriations and payment appropriations. Operations extending over more than one financial year have a deadline attached, i.e. a date by which the relevant projects must be completed.      Commitment appropriations:      Commitment appropriations cover the total cost, in the current financial year, of the legal obligations entered into for operations to be carried out over more than one financial year. This type of appropriation constitutes the upper limit of expenditure which can be committed during the financial year.      Payment appropriations:      Payment appropriations cover expenditure arising from commitments entered into during the current financial year or preceding years.      Appropriations for commitment:      This term refers to the sum of commitment appropriations and non-differentiated appropriations.*      Appropriations for payment:      This term refers to the sum of payment appropriations and non-differentiated appropriations. *In effect, non-differentiated appropriations authorise an equal amount of commitments and payments, so that both aspects must be fully taken into account.      Principles of sound financial management:      Principles underlying the use of budget appropriations, including economy, cost-effectiveness, evaluation prior to mobilisation of Community resources, regular review of operations, etc.      Financial statement:      The financial statement sets out the various financial aspects of an operation (financial consequences, links with financial instruments, schedule, etc). Any proposal or communication which may have budgetary consequences must include a financial statement.      No offsetting:      According to this principle, all revenue and expenditure must be entered in full with no adjustment against each other, thus ensuring an exhaustive and complete presentation of the budget.      No assignment of revenue:      This rule prevents specific revenue from being used to finance specific expenditure. Total revenue covers total expenditure. There are exceptions to this principle: for example Member States' financial contributions to certain research programmes and contributions from non-member countries to Community activities under the Agreement on the European Economic Area.      Booking of revenue and expenditure to articles:      Revenue can be collected and expenditure effected only if it is booked to an article in the budget. This means that all financial operations (revenue or expenditure) must have a budgetary basis, i.e. a specific article in the budget. In addition, no expenditure may exceed the authorised appropriations.      Carryover of appropriations:      As a general rule, non-differentiated appropriations lapse if they are not used at the end of the financial year for which they are entered. However, in the case of payments outstanding in respect of commitments entered into before the end of the financial year, appropriations left unused must be transferred to the budget of the following year. Optional carryovers are possible when requirements cannot be met from the budget of the following financial year. Differentiated appropriations (consisting of commitment appropriations and payment appropriations) also lapse if they are not used at the end of the financial year, although a decision may be taken to carry them over in certain instances (e.g. where the basic legislative instrument is adopted at the end of December and the Commission is unable to commit the amounts before 31 December).      Provisional twelfths:      If the budget is not finally adopted by the beginning of the financial year, i.e. 1 January, the "provisional twelfths" system comes into operation. In this case, payments may be made monthly up to a limit of one twelfth of the appropriations entered in the budget of the previous financial year.      Adoption of the budget:      The adoption of the budget marks the end of the budget procedure. The budget, which is drawn up in euros, is declared adopted by the President of Parliament and then published in the Official Journal. Once the budget has been finally adopted, each Member State is required to make available to the Community its own resources payments with effect from 1 January of the following financial year.      Reserves:      Under European budgetary law, there are six types of reserves, of which three are expressly provided for by the Financial Regulation:     These reserves are designed to facilitate budget management. They can be drawn on - during the financial year - to enter amounts in a budget line for an operation that was not entirely finalised when the budget was adopted, to increase the authorised appropriations in order to deal with unforeseen circumstances or to reduce the authorised appropriations for the sake of economy, taking into account the progress made in implementation. The reserves can be used only by implementing a transfer procedure.     The financial perspective provides for three other reserves designed to create room for manoeuvre, so that expenditure can be covered even where the requirements could not easily have been foreseen when the financial perspective was drawn up:      Discharge:      The European Parliament, acting on a recommendation by the Council, grants the Commission discharge for its implementation of the budget, after examining a series of reports, in particular that of the Court of Auditors. The purpose is to bring the financial year to a close in both formal and political terms. The discharge decision covers the accounts of all Community revenue and expenditure and the situation described in the balance sheet (statement of assets and liabilities). It consists of an appraisal of how the Commission has discharged its responsibility for budget management over the past financial year.      II. Establishment of the budget      The first stage in the process leading to the establishment of the budget is that each institution (Parliament, the Council, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the Economic and Social Committee and Committee of the Regions and the Ombudsman) draws up estimates of its expenditure and revenue for the following year and sends them to the Commission.     After receiving the various estimates, the Commission draws up the preliminary draft budget, which must be presented by 1 September and contains:      a general statement of the revenue of the Communities;       a statement of estimates;       a general introduction including financial tables covering the entire budget and a description of the policies for which the appropriations are requested;       an introduction to each section, drafted by the institution concerned;       a working paper on the staff of the institutions (staff policy, variation in staff numbers, etc);       a working paper on subsidies to decentralised bodies (agencies, European schools etc);       an analysis of financial management over the past year and a balance sheet setting out the Communities' assets and liabilities;       an opinion on the estimates of the other institutions.      During the procedure, the Commission may amend this preliminary draft by sending a letter of amendment to the Council at least 30 days before Parliament's first reading of the draft budget.     In exceptional circumstances, the Commission may present preliminary draft supplementary and/or amending budgets, which are examined according to the usual budgetary procedure. A preliminary draft supplementary budget either increases the total amount of appropriations or finances new operations without increasing appropriations. A preliminary draft amending budget makes technical changes, without increasing the overall budget or providing for new operations. These preliminary drafts must be accompanied by statements of justification.     The budgetary procedure is laid down in Article 272 of the EC Treaty. After examining the preliminary draft budget, the Council sends Parliament a draft budget, accompanied by an explanatory memorandum explaining why it has departed from the preliminary draft budget, if it has done so.      III. Structure and presentation of the budget      The budget contains a general statement of revenue (estimated revenue of the Communities for the financial year in question and actual revenue in the previous financial year), plus a number of sections subdivided into statements of revenue (revenue for the financial year in question and the previous year, together with the relevant remarks) and expenditure. The various sections cover:     The Commission section contains a Part A (staff and administrative expenditure) and a Part B (operational expenditure). Part B is broken down into several sub-sections, according to requirements. These subsections, which correspond to European Union policies, are shown in the table below. The figures are taken from the 1999 budget.         Policies (sub-sections)             Amount in 1999 budget (EUR million)             Percentage of the total budget             Common agricultural policy (CAP)European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, Guarantee Section             40 940.0             42.2             Structural operationsstructural and cohesion expenditure             39 260.0             40.5             Training, youth, culture, audiovisual media, information, social dimension and employment             812.0             0.8             Energy and environment             235.4             0.2             Consumer protection, internal market, industry and trans-European networks             1129.1             1.2             Research and technological development             3450.0             3.6             External action             6223.8             6.4             Common foreign and security policy             30.0             0.0             Guarantees and reserves             346.0             0.4         Each section or subsection is divided into titles, chapters, articles and items. The statement of expenditure in each section (i.e. for each institution) includes, for the various titles, chapters, articles and items (each subdivision being accompanied by remarks):      the appropriations made available for the financial year in question;       the appropriations made available for the previous financial year;       actual expenditure in the last financial year (= actual payments plus carryovers to the following financial year).       IV. Implementation of the budget      The implementation of the budget is based on a fundamental principle - the need for a legislative basis - which has been both the cause and the result of a series of crises between the two arms of the budgetary authority. The implementation of appropriations entered in the budget for "significant" Community action requires the prior adoption of a basic act, i.e. a legal provision such as a regulation, a decision, etc., providing for the expenditure. Pilot schemes and certain kinds of information activities are deemed not to be "significant", so that they can be put into effect merely on the basis of the relevant line in the Community budget.     The Community budget is implemented by the European Commission, acting under its own responsibility, in accordance with the Financial Regulation and within the limits of the appropriations entered in the budget. But while the Commission's implementing responsibilities cover its own internal operations and Community policies, the other institutions (Parliament and the Council, etc.) implement the sections of the budget which concern them. This power to implement the budget cannot be delegated to external bodies, at least in relation to the tasks of the European civil service (e.g. public procurement). Implementing powers may be delegated within the European administration so that certain officials act as authorising officers, accounting officers and financial controllers. In practical terms, it is they who implement the budget. This internal delegation of powers is subject to strict conditions in order to avoid conflicts of interest or abuse of power.     Within the European administration the implementation of the Community budget rests on the existence of three different functions, which must be performed separately: authorising officer, accounting officer and financial controller.     The       authorising officer      administers the appropriations. He alone has the power to "commit" expenditure, i.e. to give the initial authorisation for expenditure. The authorising officer is liable to disciplinary action and may be held financially liable if he fails to comply with the Financial Regulation or neglects tasks relating to his function.     The       accounting officer      makes the payments. He is the only person empowered to handle monies and other assets and is also responsible for their safekeeping. The accounting officer is liable to disciplinary action and may be held financially liable for payments in which a procedural error is detected. Officials performing accounting functions receive a special allowance to compensate for their increased responsibility vis-à-vis "ordinary" officials.     The       financial controller      carries out monitoring and audit tasks. He checks the commitment and authorisation of all expenditure and ensures that revenue is properly collected. In short, he checks the legality of operations. To carry out this task, the financial controller has access to all the necessary documents and information. In his capacity as auditor, he is also regularly consulted on and evaluates changes to financial management systems. Commission staff exercising this function are governed by special rules guaranteeing their independence (for example, in certain cases they may bring actions before the Court of Justice). The financial controller is liable to disciplinary action and may be held financially liable if he grants his approval to expenditure in excess of the budget appropriations.     In a stricter sense, implementation of the Community budget consists mainly of expenditure, which, under budgetary law, is broken down into various stages: commitment, validation, authorisation and payment:         1 Commitment             Prior to any measure which may give rise to expenditure (in particular legal commitments vis-à-vis third parties), the authorising officer must draw up a proposal for a budgetary commitment on which the financial controller must grant his approval. The purpose of the financial controller's approval is to establish that the appropriations are available and that the expenditure is consistent with the relevant legislation and correctly charged to the budget. If some of these conditions are not met, the financial controller may refuse to grant his approval. The superior authority may overrule such a refusal, informing the Court of Auditors of its decision, but this hypothetical facility is rarely used in practice.             2 Validation             Validation is the act whereby the authorising officer checks the claim of the creditor (the recipient of expenditure), the amount of that claim and the conditions under which payment falls due. Validation is subject to presentation of supporting documents.             3 Authorisation             Authorisation is the act whereby the authorising officer instructs the accounting officer to pay an item of expenditure which he has validated. Payment orders are sent for prior approval to the financial controller, the purpose being to establish, among other things, that the payment order agrees with the commitment of expenditure and that the amount is correct. After approval, the order is forwarded to the accounting officer.             4 Payment             Payment is the final action whereby the institution is discharged of its obligations towards its creditors. It is carried out by the accounting officer.         Appropriations are classified under chapters and articles. Parliament and the Council may transfer appropriations from one chapter to another and from one article to another within their own section of the budget. The Commission may, within its section of the budget, transfer appropriations from one article to another within each chapter and from one chapter to another within each of the titles relating to staff and administrative expenditure. The Commission informs the budgetary authority of these transfers, giving a statement of the grounds.     The balance from each financial year is entered in the budget of the following financial year as revenue or expenditure, depending on whether it represents a surplus or a deficit.     During the financial year, the Commission sends Parliament, the Council and the Court of Auditors figures on the implementation of the budget in the form of:      monthly reports on both revenue and expenditure, together with information on the use of appropriations carried over from previous financial years;       a report every four months on revenue and expenditure, together with information on the use of appropriations carried over from previous financial years.      In the course of the year, following a given financial year, the Commission produces several documents describing its financial activities in that financial year. By no later than 1 May of the following year, it draws up a       consolidated revenue and expenditure account      comprising:     The revenue and expenditure account encompasses all revenue and expenditure operations relating to the past financial year for each institution. It is presented in the same form as the budget. At the same time, the Commission presents a       consolidated balance sheet      setting out the Communities' assets and liabilities, including borrowing and lending operations, and an       analysis of financial management.      The institutions comply with existing European legislation regarding public procurement.     The Communities' movable and immovable property is recorded in an inventory, which is used in drawing up each institution's balance sheet.     The Community accounts are kept in euros, using the double entry method, on the basis of the calendar year. The accounts show all revenue and expenditure for the financial year and are supplemented by supporting documents.     The Court of Auditors monitors the implementation of the Community budget. The institutions send it all the supporting documents required for that purpose. The object of the Court's supervision is to ensure that revenue and expenditure is legal and consistent with the Treaties, the budget and Community legislation. The Court also ensures that sound financial management is practiced. The Court's comments are set out in its annual report. It may present special reports when it wishes to comment on specific matters. Special reports may also be drawn up at the request of an institution.      V.

   Specific programme “Capacities”     Specific programme “Capacities”     This specific programme aims to reinforce research infrastructure in Europe. The various measures are intended to bring together SMEs, the regions, civil society and third countries in the scientific community, and to reinforce the research potential of the various players and coherence between policies. The document presents the specific programme in a detailed manner (specific objectives, features, approaches, spheres of activity, etc).     ACT     Council Decision       2006/974/EC      of 19 December 2006 on the Specific Programme: capacities implementing the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (2007 to 2013).     SUMMARY     Continuing previous action, the "Capacities" programme aims in the main to create new research and innovation infrastructures across Europe.     To this end, the programme calls for a       strategic approach      in two phases: a       preparatory phase      and a       construction phase      . This approach concerns the following areas:      research infrastructures;       research to benefit SMEs;       regions of knowledge;       research potential;       science in society;       horizontal activities in the field of international cooperation.      The budget required for executing this specific programme is estimated at EUR 4 097 million for the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013.      CHARACTERISTICS AND GENERAL AIMS      All of the financial resources mobilised by the programme correspond to specific       aims      in each area:      to optimise use and development of         research infrastructures        ;       to reinforce         SMEs'        innovation capacities and their ability to benefit from research;       to promote and sustain development of         regional groupings        which depend on research;       to unlock research potential in the European Union’s convergence and outermost         regions        ;       to bring         science        and         society        closer together;       to stimulate         international cooperation        ;       to encourage         coherence        in research policy and synergies with other policies and Community programmes.      It is worth noting that the       7th Framework Programme      , including the various specific programmes and the research activities they give rise to, should respect       fundamental ethical principles      and give consideration to       social      ,       legal      ,       socio-economic      ,       cultural      and       gender equality aspects      .      THEMES: OBJECTIVES, APPROACHES, ACTIVITIES      For each of the       themes      touched on by the programme, the following are defined:      a specific aim;       a suitable approach;       specific activities.       Research infrastructures      The specific programme aims to       optimise      the use and development of European research infrastructures       *      and to       support      their creation or modernisation. Support measures could also be proposed in order to respond to possible needs arising at a later date. More generally, it is a question of reinforcing the technological know-how of Europe to       benefit      a more competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy.     The       measures      relating to research infrastructures (which may already exist or have been newly created) and the emergence of new needs involve:      promoting trans-national access to structures already in place;       improving coordination through integrated modernisation;       developing on-line infrastructure based on         ICT        ;       supporting the design and creation of new infrastructures;       strengthening cooperation within Europe and internationally.      The       budget      allocated to this field of research will amount to EUR 1 715 million.      Research benefiting SMEs      To allow       SMEs      and       SME associations      to use advances made in research to benefit their       growth      , their       know-how      and their       innovation capacity      , two special schemes are planned:      one is designed to aid small business groups to resolve, in the short term, common or complementary technological problems;       the second should allow technical solutions to be found for problems common to a large number of SMEs on a longer-term basis (e.g. conformity to European norms or regulations in areas such as health, safety and environmental protection.)      These projects will receive funding of EUR 1 336 million.      Regions of knowledge       Strengthening      the research potential of       European regions      is the prime objective pursued here by the specific programme. To do this, support will be concentrated throughout Europe on the development of "regional clusters", bringing together regional authorities, universities, research centres, businesses and other stakeholders. Better coordination between regional policy and research policies is one of the priorities of the programme.     The different       projects      in this section concern the following       activities      :      analysis, development and implementation of the research agendas of regional clusters (planning capacity and priorities for research and development);       “mentoring” of regions with a less developed research profile by highly developed ones, in particular by setting up trans-national regional consortia;       initiatives to improve integration of research actors and institutions in regional economies (e.g. trans-national activities organised within the framework of regional clusters);       measures aiming to promote the systematic exchange of information and interaction between similar projects (e.g. analysis and synthesis workshops, round tables, publications, etc.).      The       budget      allocated to the regions of knowledge will be EUR 126 million.      Research potential      The programme's impact should centre around the European Union’s convergence and       outermost regions      to enable them to benefit fully from their research potential. This should, in the long term, stimulate the       research potential      (reinforcing knowledge, developing new skills, increasing visibility) of the enlarged Union.     In terms of specific       activities      , the focus will be on encouraging       strategic partnerships      , including       twinning      , between research groups from these regions (from both the public and private sectors) with prominent research groups elsewhere in Europe. These partnerships and twinning schemes will allow research groups in the least advanced regions, selected on the basis of their quality and potential, to benefit from:      exchanging knowledge and experience;       recruiting experienced researchers in charge of imparting knowledge and giving training;       acquiring and developing some research equipment;       organising workshops and conferences;       dissemination and promotion activities to maximise their visibility.      EUR 340 million funding will be dedicated to the development of research potential.      Science in society      Building an effective and democratic       knowledge-based European society      inevitably entails the integration of the       scientific dimension      into       the European social fabric.      Despite being the driving force behind innovation and therefore       growth      , well-being and sustainable development, scientific research remains, generally speaking, badly integrated within society. Several causes for this can be identified:      insufficient public participation in the debate relating to the priorities and direction of scientific policy;       growing reservations with regard to certain scientific developments (lack of control, the questioning of fundamental values, etc.);       the perceived isolation of science from the everyday realities of economic and social life;       questioning the objectivity of scientific evidence made available to public policy-makers.      Further ambiguities arise from the increasing desire to undertake more research to address major social challenges (diseases, pollution, epidemics, unemployment, climate change, ageing of the population, etc.) and from a growing feeling of distrust regarding the possible misuses of science.     The danger of an increasing       scientific divide      in our societies therefore makes it essential to:      make scientific research more open, transparent and ethical;       strengthen the role of Europe on a global level in debates on shared values, equal opportunities and social dialogue;       bridge the gap between those who have scientific training and those who do not;       encourage a taste for scientific culture;       stimulate public debate on research policy;       make the world of science more accessible and more comprehensible;       help women to continue to progress in scientific careers;       adapt scientific communication to the present (using new means of communication to reach the widest possible audience).      Implementing this aspect will follow three general strands:       management of the relationship between science and society        : strengthening and improving the European science system, anticipating and resolving political, ethical and social problems, a better understanding of the place of science and technology in society, development of the role of universities;        potential and prospects for the scientific world        : consolidating the role of women and young people;        scientific communication        : re-establishing the connection between science and society.      In terms of the European science system, three aspects are on the agenda:      improving the use of scientific advice and expertise in developing policies in Europe and evaluating their impact;       promoting trust and self-regulation within the scientific community;       encouraging debate on the distribution of information.      In anticipating and resolving       political, ethical and social problems      , two aspects come into play:      broader engagement on science-related questions;       setting up an informed debate on ethics and science.      To improve       understanding of the place of science and technology in society      , the programme advocates the formation of specialised university networks. These would have the task of demonstrating the actual role of science in building a European society and identity. To this end, several elements should be highlighted:      relationships between science, democracy and law;       research on ethics in science and technology;       the reciprocal influences of science and culture;       the role and image of scientists.      Regarding the       evolving role of universities      , emphasis will be placed on:      defining better framework conditions to optimise university research;       promoting structured partnerships with the business world;       reinforcing knowledge-sharing between universities and society at large.      Furthermore, programmes will be put in place to reinforce       the role of women      and the       gender dimension      within scientific research.     Equally,       youth      -based activities will be centred around:      supporting science education in schools;       reinforcing links between science education and science careers;       research and coordination on new methods in science teaching.      On matters of       scientific communication      , efforts will focus on the following aspects:      the reliability of information distributed to the scientific press;       creation of a European centre for scientific information;       training in and exchange of good practice to bring the media and the scientific community closer together;       reinforcing the European dimension of science events targeting the general public;       increasing the prominence of science by using audiovisuals;       promoting multinational communication (e.g. by awarding public prizes);       researching new methods and equipment to aid communication of scientific material.      The       budget      allocated to this topic will be EUR 330 million.      International cooperation      To develop an       international policy      of the first order for science and technology, the EU intends to:      support European competitiveness through         strategic partnerships        with third countries and welcome their best scientists to Europe;       address problems of accessibility that third countries face or will face.      Cooperation with third countries will mainly involve the candidate countries, the Mediterranean Partner Countries (MPC), the Western Balkan countries (WBC), the countries of Eastern Europe, Central Asia and the Caucasus (EECAC), developing countries and emerging economies.     This cooperation will entail:      the establishment of priorities and definition of policies;       improving and developing partnerships;       improving coordination of national policies and activities.      A budget of EUR 180 million will be dedicated to activities in the field of international cooperation.      Coherence of research policies      In addition to enhancing the efficiency and coherence of national and community research policies, the EU aims to:      increase their coordination with other policies;       improve the impact of public research and its links with businesses;       increase public funding and its leverage effect on private sector investments.      To do this, two lines of action will be adopted:      monitoring and analysis of research-related public policies and industrial strategies, including their impact;       supporting         open coordination        and transnational cooperation initiatives.      These activities will receive EUR 70 million funding from the programme.      Background      Since 1984, the EU has been following a technology research and development policy based on multi-annual framework programmes. The Seventh Framework Programme is the second since the launching of the       Lisbon strategy      in 2000. Its role is vital in relation to growth and employment in Europe over the coming years.       Key terms in the act         Research infrastructure: facilities, resources and services which the scientific community needs to do its research in all scientific and technological domains. This encompasses personnel, equipment, knowledge-based resources, information and communications technology, plus anything used for scientific research.

All actions under the “Capacities” programme are in heavy demand, notably those supporting research for SMEs and SME associations. The realisation of 44 priority infrastructure projects of strategic European interest identified by the 'European Strategic Forum on Research Infrastructures' (ESFRI) are limited by a lack of Community and national resources. However, the adoption of a new       legal framework for European research infrastructures      in 2009 should provide a further boost and financial planning security integrating other financial instruments (EIB, Structural Funds).     The "Research potential" and "Regions of knowledge" activities which bring together scientific capacity between regions have not produced the expected results (particularly in convergence regions), as they also suffer from a lack of resources. A more efficient, targeted use of Structural Funds would raise the level of scientific and technological excellence in the EU.     The new financial system is more encouraging towards the creation of a partnership between research and society.      Decision N°         743/2008/EC        of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on the Community’s participation in a research and development programme undertaken by several Member States aimed at supporting research and development performing small and medium-sized enterprises [Official Journal L 201 of 30.7.2008].      The Eurostars programme supports research and development (R&D) performing SMEs. This programme is founded on Article 169 of the EC Treaty concerning the participation of the Community in the R&D programme implemented jointly by several Member States. Eurostars is aimed at aligning and synchronising national research and innovation programmes to establish an integrated joint programme in scientific, management and financial fields and to contribute towards the realisation of the European Research Area.     Eurostars is a joint programme between Eureka and the Seventh Framework Programme for technological research and development (Capacities).     It is co-funded by Member States, the other participating countries and the Community. The Community financial contribution will be EUR 100 million, whilst the 22 Member States of the EU and the 5 countries associated to the 7th FPRD will jointly provide an additional EUR 300 million. Private funding will reach EUR 400 million. The total amount for European SMEs that are active in the field of research will therefore be EUR 800 million over six years.

   Access for air carriers to intra-Community air routes (third phase)     Access for air carriers to intra-Community air routes (third phase)     This Regulation works towards the liberalisation of the provision of intra-Community air services.     ACT     Council Regulation (EEC) No       2408/92      of 23 July 1992 on access for Community air carriers to intra-Community air routes     SUMMARY     The Regulation repeals Council Regulation (EEC) No       2343/90      , except for Article 2 and Annex I.     It covers access for air carriers to scheduled and non–scheduled intra-Community air services. Special provisions apply to the Greek islands, the Azores and the airport of Gibraltar.     Community air carriers may exercise traffic rights between airports or airport systems within the Community where these are open to civil air services.     A Member State may impose a public service obligation (air services meeting fixed standards to which the air carrier would not operate if he were considering nothing but his commercial interest) in respect of scheduled air services to a regional airport on a route which is considered vital for the economic development of the region.     If no air carrier is yet providing a scheduled service on a route for which a public service obligation has been imposed, the Member State may limit access to that route to only one air carrier for a period of up to three years. The right to operate must be offered by public tender. The selection must be made as quickly as possible. In spite of this provision, two months must elapse between publication and selection but this constraint does not apply where another Member State whose interests are involved proposes a satisfactory alternative means of fulfilling the same public service obligation.     The Regulation does not affect a Member State's right to regulate, without discrimination, the allocation of traffic to airports forming part of an airport system. The exercising of traffic rights is subject to Community, national, regional or local rules relating to safety, the protection of the environment and slot allocation.     When the conditions listed in point 5 are not met, a Member State may limit, or refuse, the exercising of those traffic rights but must first inform the Commission of its intention. Any Member State may refer the Commission's decision on such a situation to the Council within one month.     In order to carry out its duties under the Regulation, the Commission may obtain all necessary information from the Member States and air carriers concerned.      Context      Regulation (EC) n°2408/92 is repealed and replaced, as from 1 November 2008, by Regulation (EC) n°       1008/2008      establishing common rules for the operation of air services in the Community. In particular, this Regulation introduces new rules on access for air carriers to air routes.

summary of   Commission Communication COM(2012) 586 final: The EU Approach to Resilience: Learning from food security crises   summary    what does this communication do  It seeks to use the lessons from this region to improve the effectiveness of the EU's contribution to reducing vulnerability in disaster-prone and fragile countries, by including the concept of resilience* as a central goal.   key points    Reducing humanitarian needs, alleviating poverty and addressing fragility require systematic efforts to build the resilience of vulnerable populations.   It requires multifaceted and long term strategies aimed at alleviating the underlying causes of crises and strengthening capacities to better manage uncertainty and change.   Improved services, opportunity and protection from shocks and stresses will improve the livelihoods of the most vulnerable. When crises arise, risk management will lead to an earlier, more effective response to address immediate needs, limit losses and hasten recovery.   Resilience considerations – risk management and vulnerability reduction – should be appropriately integrated into all development and recovery strategies.    EU response to food crises in Africa   Following the food crises in Africa, a humanitarian-development response was put in place by the EU. In addition to life-saving activities, this assistance also contributed to the recovery process, for instance through the provision of seeds and tools, and improved water management.  Longer-term resilience strategies are helping the affected countries and communities to recover and build up their ability to cope with future crises.  The  SHARE  * and  AGIR  *  resilience initiatives  represent an improvement in the way humanitarian and development assistance interact. Short-term assistance is enhanced when the link between relief, rehabilitation and development (  LRRD  ) is recognised. The EU can commit to addressing the root causes of food insecurity in the longer term by restoring livelihoods, strengthening social protection and disaster management systems, and improving nutrition.  These measures focus on food security - and food crises - in sub-Saharan Africa. However, this approach is applicable to other regions and other types of vulnerability such as regions threatened by:   floods   cyclones   earthquakes   droughts   storm surges and tsunamis   climate change   food price increases.   It concentrates on  3 key components  :    1.    Anticipating crises by assessing risks      2.    Focusing on prevention and preparedness      3.    Enhancing crisis response.     The Communication puts forward a  10-point plan  to increase resilience, including promoting dialogue on resilience with non-EU countries through available channels such as the  United Nations  , and the G8 and  G20  forums of rich and emerging nations. The plan was consolidated and expanded in the  Action Plan for Resilience in Crisis Prone Countries 2013–2020  which calls upon the EU and EU countries to:   support AGIR, SHARE and other resilience initiatives in different contexts and regions,   include disaster risk management on the resilience agenda,   promote integrated approaches to climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction and resilience,   integrate resilience in the  food and nutrition security agenda  ,   strengthen assistance mechanisms for vulnerable population groups, supporting the development of national approaches to social protection.   expand support for risk financing solutions at a national and local level, including insurance and catastrophe bonds,   support the development of a local private sector, growth opportunities and long-lasting solutions for resilience strengthening of vulnerable populations,   support local initiatives by local organisations,   develop urban resilience methodologies, testing and evaluation,   develop resilience approaches to chronic refugee challenges,   support resilience and capacity development at local level in the  EU aid volunteers' initiative  (under discussion),   enhance the resilience knowledge and evidence base,   develop common approaches to advocacy,   provide operational resilience guidance for the  European Commission  and other partners,   use improved methodologies and tools for risk assessments, risk management and measuring resilience, and   apply and develop flexible financial instruments and contingencies.   background   Recurrent food and nutrition crises in the Sahel and the Horn of Africa affect millions of people, result in widespread hunger, and contribute to keeping people in a perpetual state of poverty. This situation underscores the need for a long-term and systematic approach to building the resilience of vulnerable countries and populations.   key terms    *Resilience  : the ability of an individual, household, community, country or region to withstand, adapt, and quickly recover from stresses and shocks   *SHARE  : Supporting the Horn of Africa’s Resilience   *AGIR  : Global Alliance for Resilience   act   Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council - The EU Approach to Resilience: Learning from food security crises (  COM(2012) 586 final  of 3.10.2012)
summary of   Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 — harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products   what is the aim of the regulation  It aims to make the single market work better and improve the free movement of construction products  *  in the EU, by laying down uniform rules for the marketing of these products and by providing a common technical language to assess the performance of construction products.  In this way the regulation also enables EU countries to ensure the safety of construction works  *  .  It repeals Directive  89/106/EEC  .   key points   The regulation sets out the conditions for the marketing of construction products.  It sets out methods and criteria for assessing and expressing the performance of construction products  *  , and the conditions for the use of  CE marking  .  EU countries, on the other hand, are responsible for fire safety, mechanical resistance and stability, environmental, energy and other requirements applicable to construction works.   Declaration of Performance and CE marking   Where a manufacturer decides to place a construction product on the market and that product is covered by a harmonised standard or a European Technical Assessment has been issued for it, the manufacturer must draw up a Declaration of Performance which contains, among other things, the following information:   product reference;   systems of assessment and verification of consistency of performance of the product;   reference of the applicable harmonised standard or European Technical Assessment;   intended use or uses for the product;   declared performance based on the assessment according to the applicable harmonised standard or European Technical Assessment.   Once the Declaration of Performance has been drawn up, the manufacturer must affix a CE marking to the product.  The CE marking indicates that the performance of the product has been assessed and that it remains constant.  CE marking enables a construction product to be placed legally on the market in any EU country and then be traded on the EU’s single market.  EU countries must establish  Product Contact Points for Construction  to provide information on the requirements for construction products.   Obligations of manufacturers, importers and distributors    Manufacturers  must:   prepare technical documentation and on its basis draw up a Declaration of Performance and affix CE marking to the product;   ensure that the product maintains its conformity with the Declaration of Performance. Where manufacturers consider that the product no longer conforms with the Declaration of Performance, they must immediately take the necessary corrective measures or withdraw or recall the product from the market.    Importers  must:   ensure that the product bears CE marking and is accompanied by the required documentation;   avoid placing the product on the market if they consider it is not in conformity with the Declaration of Performance;   ensure that the product maintains its conformity with the Declaration of Performance and that its transport or storage do not jeopardise its performance. Where a product does not conform with the Declaration of Performance, importers must immediately take the necessary corrective measures or withdraw or recall the product from the market.    Obligations of distributors  include:   ensuring that the product bears CE marking and that it is accompanied by the required documentation;   not making the product available on the market if they consider it does not conform with the Declaration of Performance, until it is brought into conformity or until the Declaration of Performance is corrected;   ensuring that the product’s transport or storage do not jeopardise its performance. Where a product does not conform with its Declaration of Performance, distributors must ensure the necessary corrective measures are taken, or that the product is withdrawn or recalled from the market.    Harmonised technical specifications   Harmonised technical specifications include  harmonised standards  and  European Assessment Documents  . Harmonised standards are drawn up by European standardisation bodies (  European Committee for Standardization  or  European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization  ) on the basis of requests issued by the  European Commission  . Harmonised standards define the  methods and the criteria  for assessing the performance of construction products.  If a construction product is not covered or not fully covered by a harmonised standard, manufacturers may request a  European Technical Assessment  , issued by one of the Technical Assessment Bodies on the basis of a European Assessment Document developed by the  European Organisation for Technical Assessment  .The European Technical Assessment is a documented assessment of the performance of a construction product, in relation to its essential characteristics.  Harmonised standards and European Technical Assessments create a common technical language used by all players in the construction sector and enable manufacturers to draw up the Declaration of Performance and affix the CE marking. References of harmonised standards and of European Assessment Documents are published in the  Official Journal of the European Union  .   Market surveillance   EU countries’ market surveillance authorities, established under to Regulation (EC) No  765/2008  , must ensure that the regulation is complied with in their countries.  Where these authorities find that a product does not comply with the requirements of the regulation (e.g., the product does not achieve its declared performance and presents a risk), they must without delay require the relevant economic operator to bring the product into compliance with the declared performance, or to withdraw the product from the market, or recall it within a reasonable period, appropriate to the nature of the risk.   Implementing and delegated acts   A list of implementing and delegated acts adopted by the Commission in accordance with the Construction Products Regulation is available on the Commission’s  website  .   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 1 July 2013.   background   The approach of the Construction Products Regulation for a better functioning single market for construction products is different from the general principles originally set in the New Legislative Framework. The main differences are:    The division of powers between the EU and EU countries  : the EU deals only with the single market access rules and not with requirements for products' performance itself. The EU countries are those who are responsible for fire safety, environmental, energy and other requirements applicable to construction works.    Harmonised marketing conditions  : instead of harmonising construction products or the requirements for them, the Construction Products Regulation limits itself to creating harmonised conditions for marketing such products.   The use of harmonised standards is obligatory for manufacturers when placing their construction products on the market and for EU countries when setting requirements for their performance.   Following the publication of the July  2016 Implementation Report  , the Commission's Communication ‘  Clean Energy for all Europeans  ’ announced a possible revision of the Construction Products Regulation in November 2016.  For more information, see:    Review of the construction products regulation  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Construction product:  any product or kit which is produced and placed on the market for incorporation in a permanent manner in construction works or parts thereof and the performance of which has an effect on the performance of the construction works with respect to the basic requirements for construction works.   Performance of a construction product:  the performance related to the relevant essential characteristics, expressed by level or class, or in a description.   Construction works:  buildings and civil engineering works.
act   Council Regulation (EU) No  1053/2013  of 7 October 2013 establishing an evaluation and monitoring mechanism to verify the application of the Schengen acquis and repealing the Decision of the Executive Committee of 16 September 1998 setting up a Standing Committee on the evaluation and implementation of Schengen.   summary   The main objective of the evaluation and monitoring mechanism is to ensure a  high level of mutual trust between countries  belonging to the ‘Schengen area’ in respect of their capacity to properly implement the relevant rules in all fields of the  Schengen EU legislation  (the ‘Schengen  acquis  ’).   scope of the mechanism   The evaluation mechanism covers all aspects of the legislation in this field. As regards borders, it aims to cover both the efficiency of the border controls at external borders and the absence of internal border controls.  EU countries and the Commission are to assume joint responsibility for the implementation of the whole mechanism, with the Commission providing the overall coordination.   announced and unannounced inspections   To implement the evaluation mechanism, a multiannual (5-year) and an annual programme of inspections is to be set up under the coordination of the Commission. These evaluations should take place regularly on the territory of all the Schengen states in the form of  announced and unannounced inspections  .   action plan to address deficiencies   On-site evaluations must be carried out by specially trained experts appointed by the EU countries and selected in a neutral manner, based on a  risk analysis  by the  Frontex  agency (relating to external borders) and the support of  Europol  ,  Eurojust  and other relevant EU bodies in the areas covered by their mandates.  Following this analysis and the findings of the on-site inspection, a report is prepared by the experts under the coordination of the Commission. A range of recommendations may then be sent to the EU country inspected. Where that country’s implementation of the legislation is considered lacking or there is serious neglect of its obligations, it must submit an  action plan  addressing these issues.   monitoring and follow-up   A report on the implementation of such an action plan must be submitted every 6 months to the Commission and other EU countries to confirm that the EU country monitored has taken the  required measures and steps  to remedy the weaknesses. A range of other regular reports may follow to track the implementation of the measures. If necessary, the Commission may set up new control inspections.

   Implementation of the partnership for growth and jobs (first report)     Implementation of the partnership for growth and jobs (first report)     The Communication reviews the Community Lisbon Programme and the national reform programmes. It analyses the macroeconomic, microeconomic and employment aspects of the national reform programmes and proposes 4 actions to correct the shortcomings which emerged during the evaluations. It also sets out implementing measures.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 25 January 2006 to the Spring European Council - Time to move up a gear - Part 1: The new partnership for growth and jobs [       COM(2006) 30      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The partnership for growth and jobs needs to be converted into a genuine reform with the help of the       Community Lisbon Programme      and the national reform programmes (NRPs). The Commission reviews their progress here.      Community Lisbon Programme      The Commission has already adopted two-thirds of the planned measures. However, certain measures have yet to be adopted by the European Parliament and the Council or rely for funding on an       agreement on the financial framework (2007-2013)      . Some noteworthy measures have been added to those already planned:      a         communication on research and innovation        ;       the development of an         integrated industrial policy        ;       initiatives to improve the tax and customs environment;       investigations into more competitive markets in energy and financial services;       a         proposal to create a single payment area in Europe        ;        new Community funding        available for SMEs to improve energy supply and demand.       National reform programmes      All Member States have drawn up NRPs and appointed national Lisbon coordinators. Some have streamlined internal coordination in order to improve policy coherence. The Commission does not consider it necessary at this stage to adapt the       integrated guidelines      and feels it is too early to propose formal, country-specific recommendations. The emphasis at this stage must be on implementing the partnership and the specific measures proposed at Community and national levels. The Commission draws the Member States' attention to the individual evaluations of each NRP, drawing conclusions on the macroeconomic, microeconomic and employment aspects, and on specific points which will require particular attention (weaknesses).      Macroeconomic aspects      Analysis of the NRPs from a macroeconomic point of view shows that:      many factors complicate short-term and long-term budgetary discipline, making the macroeconomic problem more serious for Member States;       Member States are trying to cut spending rather than increase taxes. However, it has yet to be clearly defined where and how savings can be made;       the measures proposed in the "euro zone" are geared mainly towards future public finances but do not aim to support labour market adjustments or to create more competitive internal markets;       despite recognition of the problem of ageing populations in Europe, NRP measures appear to be piecemeal or insufficient;       only some Member States have taken an integrated approach in planning their NRP.       Microeconomic aspects      The following conclusions may be drawn with regard to microeconomic issues:      the NRPs reflect the need to increase investment in research and promote innovation;       18 of the 25 Member States have set investment targets relative to GDP which at EU level will equate to 2.6% by 2010, falling short of the overall target of 3%. This figure is currently 1.9% for the EU;       initiatives relating to transport infrastructure and communication technologies could receive support from the         cohesion        and         rural development        funds;       access to internal markets (energy and services) deserve greater attention. The application of Community Directives in this area is a beginning;       initiatives to foster a more positive attitude towards entrepreneurship do not go far enough. Education can help to reduce the stigma of failure;       Member States need to adopt a more integrated approach in order to improve the rule-making which affects business and at the same time supplement action at Community level;       comprehensive and coordinated implementation of the different microeconomic policies may achieve much greater benefits than the sum of the individual policies put together.       Employment      The Commission draws the following conclusions with regard to employment:       the proposed employment objectives are inspired by Community objectives        but are often piecemeal and do not take the life cycle approach;       greater attention should be given to "flexicurity", facilitating the transition from one job to another with adequate social protection and a reliable lifelong learning system;       the reform of education systems concentrates mainly on the quality and transparency of qualifications, as well as access to them. Investment needs to be stepped up.       Overall conclusions      The NRPs are a good basis for implementing the partnership for growth and jobs, but not all are of equal quality:      some have set clear targets and timetables, with specific measures and budget details. Others lack such information;       the three dimensions (macroeconomic, microeconomic and employment) could be more closely integrated so that one measure would benefit several sectors;       only some Member States provide for measures to remove obstacles to market access;       the cohesion and rural development funds will be needed to achieve the Lisbon objectives, although the macroeconomic repercussions of using these funds will need to be taken into account. Coordination mechanisms need to be put in place for planning the use of these funds and drafting the NRPs.       Key areas      The Commission calls on the Member States to implement their national reform programmes fully and on time. To correct the shortcomings which emerged from the evaluations, it proposes four integrated actions which it intends to implement by the end of 2007:      Action 1: Investing more in knowledge and innovation      The Lisbon objective was to boost R&D spending to 3% of GDP by 2010 (1% from the public sector, 2% from the private sector). Member States must increase public spending and make it more effective through wider use of fiscal incentives and closer coordination with the other Member States with regard to spending. Public procurement has a part to play in transforming the results of research into innovation. At the same time, more competitive markets encourage       businesses to be more innovative      .     The private sector must be able to make a greater contribution to funding for higher education, and the link between universities and business must be strengthened. The objective should be to increase       investment in higher education to 2% of GDP      .      Action 2: Unlocking the business potential of SMEs      By 2007, every Member State should have set up a one-stop shop to assist would-be entrepreneurs to fulfil administrative requirements all in one place - electronically, where possible. They must set up similar one-stop shops for VAT and for the recruitment of a first employee. The time taken to set up a business should be cut in half, and start-up fees should be as low as possible.     By that date they must also adopt a methodology for measuring administrative costs for national rules and regulations. This exercise should facilitate initiatives to reduce these administrative costs. The Commission will propose similar initiatives at Community level.      Action 3: Responding to globalisation and ageing      Member States must help people to work longer, and they need to reform pension schemes, for example by changing the statutory retirement age, enhancing financial incentives for older workers to remain in work, offering more training opportunities to workers over the age of 45 or allowing gradual retirement. Disability schemes, together with health care and long-term care systems, should also be reviewed to make them more effective.     The entry of young people into the labour market, in line with the       Youth Pact      , is another important factor. By 2007, young people who have left school should be offered a job or additional training within 6 months, or within 100 days by 2010.     The Commission wishes to consult the social partners on better ways to reconcile family and professional life. It also plans to present a report in order to seek agreement on 'flexicurity' by the end of 2007, comprising the following elements:      reduction of labour market segmentation and undeclared work;       Member States to establish lifelong learning strategies to prepare people for change, supported by the European Social Fund and the Globalisation Adjustment Fund;       removal of obstacles to worker mobility by reaching a political agreement on the         portability of supplementary pension rights        .       Action 4: Moving towards an efficient EU energy policy      The Commission is proposing an energy policy designed to ensure that energy is secure, competitive and sustainable. The security of supply will be improved by:      strengthening and deepening the internal energy market (in particular completing the energy market by 1 July 2007), by promoting more competition in the electricity and gas markets, and by more integration between the gas pipeline systems of the Member States);       exploiting the potential of renewable energy sources and promoting more efficient use of energy;       developing a more focused, coherent and integrated approach to ensuring the security of energy.      A       Green Paper      has been published on ways to achieve these objectives.      Implementation      The Commission intends to involve national (and regional) parliaments, local authorities and other stakeholders in the implementation of the NRPs, particularly where there has not been sufficient time to do so during the preparation of the programmes. It proposes to involve the social partners by holding an extraordinary Social Summit. The NRPs must be further developed and strengthened by mutual learning among Member States. Those Member States which have not yet set targets with regard to future R&D spending and the employment rate should do so. The Commission and Member States will ensure that the open method of coordination, in the areas of education and training, social protection and social inclusion, also makes a strong contribution to the objectives.     With regard to the implementation of the Community Lisbon Programme, the Commission has proposed a roadmap setting out the major steps required for measures supplementing the NRPs.     The European Union institutions and the Member States need to define a communication strategy to improve understanding of the challenges and opportunities of the new partnership for growth and jobs at local, regional and national levels. This is essential in order to develop a sense of ownership on the part of all involved.      Background      As provided for at the Spring European Council in 2005, the Commission has drawn up the first report on the implementation of the new partnership for growth and jobs. With this report, the 2006 Spring European Council will be able to review progress made and comment on any adjustments to the integrated guidelines, which serve as a basis for the national reform programmes and the Community Lisbon Programme.

summary of   Directive 2004/80/EC — relating to compensation to crime victims   what is the aim of the directive   It sets up a system of cooperation to help victims of crime get  compensation  in situations regardless of where in the European Union (EU) the crime was committed.   The system operates on the basis of EU countries’ national compensation schemes for  victims of violent intentional crime  committed on their own territories.   key points   The directive has two main elements.   It requires all EU countries to have a  compensation scheme  for victims of violent intentional crime committed on their territories. The organisation and operation of such schemes is left to the discretion of each EU country.   It sets up an  EU-wide cooperation system  based on those national schemes.    Guaranteeing adequate compensation   Ensuring adequate compensation for victims can be difficult either because:   the offender does not have the necessary financial resources; or   it has not been possible to identify or prosecute the offender (the possibility of obtaining compensation from the offender is dealt with in  Directive 2012/29/EU  establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime).   The directive requires that victims:   be compensated irrespective of their country of residence or the EU country in which the crime was committed;   receive  fair and appropriate  compensation — the exact amount is left to the discretion of the EU country in which the crime was committed.    Cooperation   All EU countries were required to set up national schemes offering fair and appropriate compensation by 1 July 2005. The directive sets up a system of cooperation between national authorities to facilitate access to compensation for victims throughout the EU:   Victims of crimes committed in an EU country other than the one in which they usually live may ask an authority in the country in which they live (  assisting authority  ) for information on how to apply for compensation.   That national authority then transmits the application directly to the national authority of the EU country in which the crime was committed (  deciding authority  ), which is responsible for assessing the application and paying out the compensation.   All communication must be carried out in the language of the deciding country. The  European Commission  has drawn up  standard forms  for the transmission of applications and decisions relating to compensation to victims.   The directive creates a system of  central contact points  in each EU country to facilitate cooperation in cross-border situations which meet regularly. Additional information is available on the website of the  European e-Justice Portal  .   from when does the directive apply  It entered into force on 26 August 2004. EU countries had to incorporate it in national law by 1 January 2006.   background   For more information, see:    ‘Compensation’  on the European Commission's website.

Provided that current efforts and foreign capital inflows were continued, only very limited problems need be expected for industrial competitiveness in the medium term, which should not be an obstacle to full participation in the enlarged EU market.     The       November 1998 Report      confirmed that progress had been made in this field, particularly with regard to competitiveness policy. Efforts needed to be made to implement EU-compatible quality systems, however. SMEs were considered a priority in Estonian economic policy.     The       October 1999 Report      emphasised that industrial development was continuing. Having completed the privatisation of the manufacturing sector, Estonia had started work on restructuring and on enhancing its competitiveness. SMEs were playing a very important part here, as they constituted 99% of the country's businesses.     The       November 2000 Report      found that Estonia had taken steps towards adopting a realistic industrial policy, but still had to make an effort to adopt an industrial policy which was distinct from its general economic policy. It continued to encourage foreign investment, and was sustaining the process of privatisation and industrial restructuring. Policy on SMEs placed particular emphasis on business development in less developed and mono-industrial regions.     The       November 2001 Report      stressed that Estonia was continuing to make progress in drawing up industrial policy-related measures. The main efforts had been recorded in the areas of innovation policy, encouraging foreign investment and privatisation of the industrial sector. With regard to SMEs, the general policy was still being implemented whilst access to finance and the business environment had been improved.     The       October 2002 Report      commented on the progress made by Estonia in the field of industrial policy and SME policy.     The       November 2003 Report      considered that Estonia was essentially meeting the commitments arising from the accession negotiations in the field of enterprise policy.     The Treaty of Accession was signed on 16 April 2003 and accession took place on 1 May 2004.      COMMUNITY ACQUIS      EC industrial policy seeks to enhance competitiveness, thus achieving rising living standards and high rates of employment. Its aim is to encourage an environment favourable to initiative, to the development of undertakings throughout the Community and to industrial cooperation, and to foster better exploitation of the industrial potential of innovation, research and technological development policies. EU industrial policy combines instruments from a number of Community policies, and includes both instruments related to the operation of markets (product specification and market access, trade policy, State aid and competition policy) and measures related to industry's capacity to adapt to change (stable macro-economic environment, technology, training etc.).     In order to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the European Union, industry in the applicant countries needs to have achieved a certain level of competitiveness by the time of accession. The applicant countries need to be seen to be pursuing policies aimed at open and competitive markets along the lines set out in Article 157 (ex Article 130) of the Treaty. Cooperation between the EU and the candidate countries in the fields of industrial cooperation, investment, industrial standardisation and conformity assessment as provided for in the Europe Agreement is also an important indicator of development in the right direction.      EVALUATION      As regards       industrial strategy      , the industrial policy paper and action plan for 2003-2006 have not yet been drawn up. Efforts in the field of industrial policy are still too fragmented. It will be necessary to develop a comprehensive industrial policy. Foreign investment is increasing, but remains concentrated in the Tallinn region. There is little change as regards privatisation and restructuring compared to the period covered by the previous report.     Estonia has made good progress since the 1998 opinion in adapting its industrial policy. This chapter has been provisionally closed, no transitional arrangements have been requested and Estonia has met its commitments (see the 2002 Report). Efforts will need to be made to further enhance competitiveness in the enterprise sector to facilitate full integration into the single market.     As regards       SME      policy, Estonia adopted the "Enterprising Estonia" document in January 2002. Its objectives are to promote entrepreneurship, to create new jobs and to enhance the competitiveness of Estonian enterprises. An action plan for 2002 has been adopted.     Estonia signed up to the European Charter for Small Enterprises in April 2002.     The business environment has been improved, mainly by reducing the administrative burden on enterprises.     It will, however, be necessary to further improve the provision of information to enterprises when the Government amends legislation, and to make access to finance easier.     Estonia has made good progress in formulating SME policy since the 1997 opinion. This chapter has been provisionally closed, no transitional arrangements have been requested and Estonia has met its commitments (see the 2002 Report).

   Accelerating progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDG)     Accelerating progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDG)     Since the European Union (EU) first adopted the commitments to financing for development and aid effectiveness during the 2002 Monterrey Conference, the Commission has provided an update on the state of progress in annual reports. In 2005, the EU reviewed and strengthened these commitments based on the present communication and confirmed the Commission's mandate to assess the progress made by the EU in relation to these commitments (official development assistance, innovative sources of financing, debt relief, aid effectiveness, more predictable aid mechanisms, exogenous shocks, untying aid, international public goods, reform of the international finance system, trade-related assistance). In 2006, the Commission presented the first progress report on the application of the new EU commitments established by the Council in 2005.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament - Accelerating progress towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals - Financing for Development and Aid Effectiveness [       COM(2005) 133      final - not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This communication outlines a way towards a new interim target for increased Official Development Assistance (ODA) volumes in the EU by 2010 and towards the UN target for ODA of 0.7% of Gross National Income (GNI) by 2015. The Commission suggests new detailed arrangements for aid, maps out options for innovative sources of finance and proposes ways to address the debt problems of low-income countries that remain after the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (       HIPC      ) initiative.      The commitment to increase financial resources for ODA      In terms of the ODA/GNI ratio, the Barcelona commitment sets a minimum rate of 0.33% for each Member State. In 2003 the EU average reached 0.34%. In volume terms, ODA rose in 2003 in 12 Member States compared to 2002. EU25 ODA flows increased from EUR 28.4 billion in 2002 to EUR 33 billion in 2003, representing an additional EUR 4.6 billion.     The Commission suggests setting two targets to be reached by 2010:      an individual threshold for Member States, differentiating between those which were already members of the EU in 2002 (EU15 Barcelona commitments) and those which joined later (EU10);       a collective average for all Member States (EU25).      The ODA of Member States which participated in the Barcelona Commitments (EU15) should be increased to the new individual baseline of 0.51% ODA/GNI, and Member States that joined after 2002 (EU10) should reach an individual baseline of 0.17% ODA/GNI by 2010.     The Commission calls on EU15 countries that have not yet done so to establish, by 2006, a firm timetable to achieve the UN target of 0.7% ODA/GNI.      Aid effectiveness: coordination and complementarity      Following the second High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness (HLF II) held in Paris in March 2005, the EU adopted a comprehensive agenda with time-bound objectives, based on the Council conclusions on harmonisation of November 2004. The EU also committed itself to additional targets (providing all capacity-building assistance through coordinated programmes with an increasing use of multi-donor arrangements; channelling 50% of government assistance through country systems; avoiding the establishment of new project implementation units; doubling the percentage of assistance provided through budget support or sector-wide arrangements; and reducing the number of uncoordinated missions by half).     A genuine European Development Strategy should be agreed to enhance aid effectiveness. Fragmentation, gaps and duplication among donors should be reduced to improve the division of labour and thereby enhance operational complementarity.       Untying aid       Member States have untied their aid to least developed countries (LDCs) in line with a recommendation from the Development Assistance Committee (DAC), and proposals for untying EC aid are currently in the legislative process. In the light of the positive impact of this approach, the EU is supporting the ongoing debates at international level on further untying aid beyond the DAC recommendations, with a specific emphasis on food aid, food aid transport and access by recipient countries to donors' aid.      Trade-Related Technical Assistance (TRTA)      Despite being the largest contributor to Trade-Related Technical Assistance (TRTA) initiatives worldwide, the EU must improve the quality and effectiveness of this aid and respond to new needs. This notably includes intensified information exchange for TRTA planning and delivery and the exchange of best practices, reinforcing the dialogue with recipient countries to ensure that they integrate trade policies into their national poverty reduction and development strategies, ensuring more flexible TRTA programmes that can adapt to changing situations, and so forth.      Global Public Goods      A task force on Global Public Goods was set up in 2003. Member States reached a consensus on:      the definition of International Public Goods (IPG) and the relevance of the selected six priority IPGs for enhanced action: trade, knowledge, peace and security, financial stability, global commons and the eradication of communicable diseases;       readiness to examine the Action Plan with a view to establishing an EU common platform for the provision and financing of IPGs;       the principle that IPGs should only be financed from existing ODA if their provision is linked to the Millennium Development Goals (         MDG        ), the three pillars of sustainable development and other agreed development objectives.      The EU should examine the forthcoming task force Action Plan on the basis of a Commission proposal for a common EU platform for the provision and financing of IPGs, agree which IPGs fall outside the scope of development and should therefore be financed from non-ODA financing sources in their national budgets, and enhance the provision of priority International Public Goods, starting with the establishment of an Action Plan at EU level.      Innovative sources of financing and new delivery mechanisms      Markedly greater aid is needed. Additional, more predictable and more stable sources of finance must be mobilised, something akin to "own resources" for development.     Member States have proposed various types of new finance mechanisms, including the possibility of "front-loading" pledged aid increases through an "International Finance Facility" (the IFF), proposals for international taxation, and voluntary options such as a global lottery or charitable donations.     Whatever options are finally implemented, increased ODA flows and new, more predictable and less volatile aid arrangements are required. This lack of flexibility and predictability prevents partner countries from embarking on the medium-term investments needed to accelerate progress towards the MDGs.      Reform of the international financial system      Despite the improved coordination between the EU Executive Directors of the IMF and the World Bank, several Member States wish to go further.     The Commission requests the Council:      to present as often as possible a single European position in the international financial institutions (IFIs), and to increase the visibility and influence of the European Union in the IFIs;       to develop a joint EU position on enhancing the voice of developing and transition countries in international economic decision-making.       Debt relief      Although the EU has made remarkable progress with the extended HIPC initiative, numerous concerns remain regarding the debts of poor countries. In the short term the overall funding of the HIPC initiative is not fully secured as long as non-Paris Club creditors do not deliver their part of debt relief. In the long term, the HIPC initiative will not suffice to ensure sustainable debt levels for poor countries.     Several problems still await solutions, such as the fact that a number of countries, mostly in post-conflict situations, may still remain excluded from the HIPC initiative, and that others, even after their graduation from HIPC, will remain in or return to debt distress situations.     The Commission invites the Council to deliver solutions to assist post-conflict countries which have not been able to benefit from the HIPC initiative to tackle the problem of having fragile institutions and most of the debt stock in arrears, and to explore the possibility of using a temporary debt service relief facility to alleviate the effects of exogenous shocks on debt-distressed countries.     RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament - Financing for Development and Aid Effectiveness - The challenges of scaling up EU aid 2006-2010 [         COM(2006) 85        final - Official Journal C 2006/130 of 3 June 2006]      This communication, together with two others entitled "       EU Aid: Delivering more, better and faster      " and       'Increasing the impact of EU aid: a common framework for drafting country strategy papers and joint multiannual programming'      , is an aid-effectiveness package which follows up on the EU's commitments in 2005 to increase development aid and improve impact and speed of delivery in order to meet the challenges of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. It provides the first assessment of the implementation of the new EU commitments established by the Council in May 2005 to which the "       European Consensus      " and the "       EU strategy for Africa      " refer. Preliminary estimates indicate that the majority of Member States have introduced the necessary measures to achieve the 2010 ODA targets. However, the individual performance of some Member States is still insufficient: these countries must increase their aid volumes to avoid jeopardising the strong performance of the EU as a whole. The ability of the new Member States to meet their commitments is evaluated very positively; they have agreed to individual baselines adapted to their specific situations. They have committed themselves to striving towards reaching the 'acquis' of the EU in 2002 (0.33% ODA/GNI) by 2015 through gradual increases of their ODA, with an intermediate target of 0.17% by 2010. Despite the annual 4.5% increase in the share of the Community budget devoted to external actions and the additional funding from the 10th European Development Fund (       EDF      ) in accordance with the European Council Conclusions on the Financial Perspective package for 2007-2013, the real share of the Community's contribution to the EU's collective ODA will fall from the present figure of 20% to 13% by 2013.

   Executive Agency for Health and Consumers     Executive Agency for Health and Consumers     The Executive Agency for Health and Consumers supports the Commission in the management of Community programmes and measures in the fields of health, consumer policy and training in matters of food safety.     ACT     Commission Decision       2008/544/EC      of 20 June 2008 amending Decision 2004/858/EC in order to transform the “Executive Agency for the Public Health Programme” into the “Executive Agency for Health and Consumers”.     SUMMARY     The Executive Agency for Health and Consumers was established on 20 June 2008 under Regulation 58/2003 laying down the       statute      for European Union executive agencies. It replaces the Executive Agency for the Public Health Programme (PHEA). It was established in Luxembourg for the period 1 January 2005 until 21 December 2015.     The Agency is responsible for implementing the programmes of Community action in the field of health       2003-2008      and       2008-2013      , the programme of Community action in the field of       Consumer policy for 2007-2013      and food safety training measures, with regard to the legislation on       foodstuffs, animal feeds, animal health and animal welfare      , as well as       plant health rules      .     The detailed tasks of the Agency were defined in the Commission decision delegating authority to the Agency adopted on 9 September 2008. Its general mission is to:      manage and supervise the life cycle of the projects;       adopt the instruments of budget implementation and implement the programmes and measures;       produce reports to help the Commission evaluate the programmes and measures.       Function and management      Management of the Agency is provided by a Steering Committee of 5 members and a director. The Commission shall appoint them for a renewable term of office for two years and four years respectively. The Agency is accountable to the Commission for the programmes’ performance.      Finance      For its running costs the Agency receives subsidies entered in the general budget of the European Communities. They are distributed from the funds allocated to the Public Health Programme 2008-2013, the Consumer Programme 2007-2014 and the food safety training measures.

   Common organisation of the market in processed fruit and vegetables     Common organisation of the market in processed fruit and vegetables     The common organisation of the processed fruit and vegetables market was radically changed in a       2007 reform      which combined the processed products sector with that of fresh fruit and vegetables.     ACT     Council Regulation (EC) No       2201/96      of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the markets in processed fruit and vegetable products [       see Amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     From 2008, processed fruit and vegetables and fresh fruit and vegetables will be brought together within the same       common market organisation      (CMO).      Scope      The products concerned are processed fruit and vegetable products (this also includes dried vegetables, sweet peppers which are neither crushed nor ground, dried fruit, figs and raisins and pectic substances).      AID SCHEME      The aid system established under this Regulation is repealed but will continue to apply for the purposes of the marketing year which will end in 2008.      General provisions      A Community production aid scheme will be introduced for tomatoes, peaches and pears intended for processing. All products, whether they are raw material or finished goods, must meet minimum quality requirements. The aid is granted to producer organisations recognised under Regulation (EC) No       2200/96      on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables. The aid is granted to producer organisations recognised under the       Regulation on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables      .     In order to receive aid, these producer organisations must conclude contracts with processors approved by the Member States. After the national authorities have checked that the products mentioned in the contracts have been duly delivered to the processing industries, the aid is allocated to the producer organisations which pass it on to the producers.     The aid amounts to:      €34.50 per tonne of tomatoes,       €47.70 per tonne of peaches,       €161.70 per tonne of pears.      If there is overrun of the Community processing threshold for pears, tomatoes and peaches, the aid is reduced. The production of dried figs and prunes derived from dried “d'Ente” plums also qualifies for aid. The aid is granted to those processors who have sold their products via a producer organisation. In all cases, the amount of production aid, which is fixed by the Commission after having consulted the Management Committee ‘Fruit and vegetables’, may not exceed the difference between the minimum price paid to the producer within the Community and the price of the raw material in the main non-EU producing and exporting countries.      Community and national thresholds      The Community aid scheme is open to recognised producer groups which deliver tomatoes, pears and citrus fruits harvested in the European Union (EU) and intended for processing. The EU has established Community thresholds to limit both the total amount of aid and national thresholds. If these limits are overrun, penalties are applied.      Specific provisions for grapes, dried figs and certain regional products      Aid is to be granted for growing grapes intended for the production of       dried grapes of the sultana and Moscatel varieties and currants.      The Community maximum guaranteed area is fixed at 53 187 hectares.     If overrun occurs during a marketing year, the aid for the following year is modulated as a result. Producers who replant vineyards affected by phylloxera and who are not entitled to aid under the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund qualify for aid for three years. For sultanas and currants, up to 27 370 tonnes of grapes are bought per year by storage agencies approved by the Member States. Storage aid is granted to storage agencies for a maximum of 18 months following the end of the marketing year in which they bought the products.     In the case of       products of major local or regional importance      , special measures may be taken to enhance their competitiveness and improve their promotion.      Reform of the common market organisations to include the new Member States      The common market organisation for fruit and vegetables was also modified in the agricultural chapter of the Act of Accession. For example, the EU has granted Malta special temporary aid for producers of tomatoes intended for processing. The duration of this aid will be 11 years from the date of accession, and will be gradually decreased over this period.      TRADE WITH NON-EU MEMBER COUNTRIES      The system described will be replaced by a       new system for trade with Non-EU Member Countries      from 2008.      Import and export licences      Imports and exports may be subject to the grant of an import or export licence.      Common Customs Tariff      The rates of duty in the Common Customs Tariff apply to processed fruit and vegetable products.      Imports      Where imports are likely to cause disturbances, safeguard measures can be adopted for all products subject to the common organisation of the market as long as they comply with the international obligations of the Community.      Tariff quotas      Tariff quotas are allocated on a 'first come, first served' basis, except for tinned mushrooms where the 'traditional/new arrivals' method is applied.      Exports      In order to permit the export of economically important quantities of products without adding sugar, export refunds may be granted to: processed tomatoes, provisionally preserved cherries, candied cherries, processed nuts and certain pure orange juices.     The amount of export refunds is fixed periodically. Export refunds are also provided for sugar and its substitutes used for making certain fruit and vegetable products subject to the common organisation of the markets. This refund is equal to that provided for in the regulations establishing the common organisation of the market in sugar. The refund for glucose and glucose syrup is that applied to products under the common organisation of the market in cereals.      Barriers to trade      When trading with Non-EU Member Countries, it is normally forbidden to impose charges having equivalent effect to customs duties or to apply any quantitative import restrictions or measures having the same effect.

act   Directive 2010/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 July 2010 on the framework for the deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in the field of road transport and for interfaces with other modes of transport.   summary   The aim of eCall is to bring rapid assistance to occupants of a vehicle involved in a serious accident anywhere in the European Union plus Iceland, Norway and Switzerland.  eCall is activated automatically as soon as in-vehicle sensors detect a serious crash. Once set off, the system dials the European emergency number 112, establishes a telephone link to the appropriate emergency call centre and sends details of the accident to the rescue services, including the time of incident, the accurate position of the crashed vehicle and the direction of travel (especially important on motorways and in tunnels). An eCall can also be triggered manually by pushing a button in the car, for example by a witness to a serious accident. Shortly after the accident, emergency services therefore know that there has been an accident and the precise location of the accident.  The data received through the eCall system will allow emergency services to provide assistance to vehicle drivers and passengers more quickly, thus helping to save lives and to treat injuries rapidly. Estimates suggest that eCall could speed up emergency response times by 40% in urban areas and 50% in the countryside, and save up to 2,500 lives a year.  In addition to the road safety benefits, eCall will also have a significant impact on reducing the congestion caused by traffic accidents and on reducing secondary accidents caused by unsecured accident sites It is also expected that the in-vehicle equipment introduced by eCall could be used for other additional emergency and/or added value services, in parallel with or building on the 112-based eCall in-vehicle system.  Directive 2010/40/EU of 7 July 2010 on the framework for the deployment of ITS in the field of road transport and for interfaces with other modes of transport has identified as one of the six priority actions for which binding specifications will have to be elaborated (Art. 6) the harmonised provision for an interoperable EU-wide eCall (art 3 d).

   Contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services     Contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services     SUMMARY OF:      Directive (EU) 2019/770 on certain aspects concerning contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services      WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?      It sets out rules concerning         contracts        for the supply of digital content or digital services, in particular:          rules on conformity with the contract; and           remedies where the digital content or digital service does not conform or if there is a failure to supply.         Digital content includes computer programmes and mobile applications, as well as video and audio files in digital form.       Digital services include, for instance, cloud computing services and social media.       The directive is part of the         digital single market strategy for Europe        .      KEY POINTS      Scope      The directive applies to any contract where a trader supplies digital content or digital services to the consumer and the consumer pays or undertakes to pay a price. It also applies when the consumer does not pay a price but provides or undertakes to provide personal data to the trader, unless the personal data provided are only processed for the purpose of supplying the digital content or digital service or for the trader to comply with legal requirements.     Exceptions include contracts regarding:      goods with digital elements (which are regulated in Directive (EU)         2019/771        );       internet access;       texting (such as SMS), with the exception of number-independent interpersonal communications;       healthcare;       gambling services;       financial services;       software offered under a free and open-source licence (where no price is paid and the personal data provided by the consumer is used only to improve the specific software);       digital content as part of a performance or event, such as digital cinematographic projection;       digital content provided by public sector bodies in accordance with Directive         2003/98/EC        .       Conformity      Digital content or digital services in general must:      fit the description, quantity and quality, and have other features such as functionality, compatibility, interoperability, as required by the contract;       be fit for the purpose agreed as part of the contract process;       be supplied with all accessories, instructions and assistance as required by the contract;       be updated as stipulated by the contract;       be fit for the purposes for which digital content or digital services of the same type would normally be used;       have the quality and performance features (including functionality, compatibility, accessibility, continuity and security), which the consumer could reasonably expect;       be supplied with any accessories and instructions which the consumer may reasonably expect to receive;       comply with any trial or preview version made available before the contract was concluded.      Traders must ensure that the consumer is informed of and supplied with updates, including security updates, necessary to keep the digital content or digital service in conformity. The directive also contains more detailed rules on the obligation to provide updates.      Trader's liability       The trader is liable for:          any             failure to supply            the digital content or digital service;           any             lack of conformity            of the digital content or digital service that exists at the time of supply and becomes apparent within a minimum of two years. If the lack of conformity becomes apparent during the first year, the consumer will not need to prove that it existed at the time of supply.         When the digital content or digital service is supplied continuously, the trader is liable for any lack of conformity that occurs and becomes apparent throughout the period of supply.       Remedies       Where the trader has         failed to supply        the digital content or digital service without undue delay or within an agreed time-frame, following a reminder, the consumer is entitled to terminate the contract.       In the case of a         lack of conformity        , the consumer is entitled to have the digital content or digital service brought into conformity (unless this is impossible or would impose disproportionate costs on the trader). If the trader fails to do so, the consumer is entitled to receive a proportionate reduction in the price or to terminate the contract.       When the contract is terminated, the trader must         fully reimburse        the consumer, except for periods when the continuously supplied digital content or digital service was in conformity.       Obligations and rights in the event of termination of the contract       Once the contract is terminated, traders must comply with the personal data obligations of Regulation (EU)         2016/679        (         General Data Protection Regulation        ). Under certain conditions, traders must:          also refrain from using content that is not personal data and was provided or created by the consumer when using the digital content or digital service;           also allow consumers to retrieve such content free of charge, without hindrance from the trader, within a reasonable time.         After the termination of the contract, consumers must refrain from using the digital content or digital service and from making it available to third parties.       EU countries must ensure that there are effective means to ensure compliance with this directive.      The directive complements Directive (EU) 2019/771 on       contracts for the sale of goods      .     FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?     It has to become law in the EU countries by 1 July 2021. EU countries must apply the rules of the directive as of 1 January 2022.

   EU-wide rail safety     EU-wide rail safety     SUMMARY OF:      Directive (EU) 2016/798 on railway safety      WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?      It aims to enhance railway safety across the EU by revising the role of national safety authorities (NSAs) and reallocating responsibilities between them and the         European Union Agency for Railways        (the Agency).       The directive is one of 3 legislative acts covering the technical aspects of the         fourth railway package        which aims to revitalise the rail sector and deliver a better quality of service and more choice to passengers. It works alongside Regulation (EU)         2016/796        on the         European Union Agency for Railways        and Directive (EU)         2016/797        on the         interoperability of the EU rail system        .       Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the directive was amended by Regulation (EU)         2020/698        and Directive (EU)         2020/700        to extend the deadline for incorporating the directive into EU countries’ national law.      KEY POINTS     The directive sets out a number of measures to develop and improve safety and to improve access to the market for rail transport services, including:      establishing the Agency as a body issuing safety certificates to railway undertakings which operate in more than one EU country;       defining the responsibilities between the different bodies involved in the EU rail system;       developing         common safety targets        and         common safety methods        with the aim of removing national rules and therefore barriers to the development of a single European railway area;       setting out the principles for issuing, renewing, amending and restricting or revoking safety certificates and authorisations;       requiring each EU country to establish a national safety authority and an investigation body for railway accidents and incidents;       defining common principles for the management and supervision of railway safety.       Scope      The directive applies to the rail system in EU countries, it does not apply to:      metros;       trams and light rail vehicles and infrastructure used exclusively by those vehicles;       networks that are not part of the EU rail system and that are intended to operate only local, urban or suburban passenger services, along with companies that operate solely on these networks.       Development and management of safety       Within their respective competences under EU law, the         Agency and the EU countries        are responsible for ensuring that railway safety is maintained and generally improved with a priority placed on preventing accidents.        EU countries        are also responsible for ensuring that:          measures to develop and improve safety follow a system-based approach;           infrastructure managers and railway companies are responsible for the safe operation of the EU rail system and the control of any associated risks.         Common safety methods and targets       The assessment of safety levels, the achievement of safety targets and compliance with other safety requirements are established using         common safety methods (CSMs)        . In particular, common methods for:          risk and evaluation assessment;           assessing conformity for issuing safety certificates and safety authorisations;           supervision by national safety authorities and for monitoring by railway companies, infrastructure managers and railway maintenance bodies;           assessing the achievement of safety targets at EU and national level.         Minimum safety targets to be achieved by the EU rail system as a whole are set out in         common safety targets (CSTs)        . CSTs may take the form of risk acceptance criteria or target safety levels.       Single safety certificate       Access to the EU railway infrastructure will only be granted to companies holding a         single safety certificate        issued either by the Agency or by the relevant national safety authorities.       The purpose of the certificate is to provide evidence that the company concerned has established its safety management system and that it is able to operate safely in its intended area of operation.       Amendments following the COVID-19 outbreak       Directive (EU) 2016/798 was due to have taken effect from 16 June 2020. However, to provide the railway sector with greater legal certainty and flexibility to deal with the exceptional circumstances arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, amending Directive (EU) 2020/700 was adopted to extend transposition and repeal periods of Directive (EU) 2016/798 (originally set at 16 June 2020 to 31 October 2020). It also aligns the application dates for the CSMs with the revised deadlines.       Regulation (EU) 2020/698 lays down specific and temporary measures in view of the COVID‐19 outbreak concerning renewing or extending certain certificates, licences and authorisations and the postponing certain periodic checks and periodic training in certain areas of transport legislation. The regulation         extends the time limits        laid down in Directive (EU) 2016/798 with regard to the renewal of single safety certificates that expire between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 and the validity of safety authorisations that expire between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 by         6 months        .       Amendment as regards the application of railway safety and interoperability rules within the Channel Fixed Link      Regulation (EU)       2020/1530      extends the definition of the national safety authority with regards to any body entrusted by an EU country and a non-EU country and sets out arrangements therewith.     FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?     The directive has applied since 15 June 2016 and had to become law in the EU countries by 16 June 2020. This date has been further extended by amending Directive (EU) 2020/700 until 31 October 2020.

summary of   Regulation (EU) 2017/1939 - implementing enhanced cooperation on the establishment of the the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (‘the EPPO’)   what is the aim of this regulation   It establishes an independent and decentralised prosecution office of the European Union with the competence to investigate, prosecute and bring to judgment crimes against the Union's financial interests.   It establishes a system of shared competences between the EPPO and national authorities in tackling such cases.   key points    Participating countries   The regulation establishing the EPPO under enhanced cooperation applies to the 22 participating EU countries: Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland.  Other EU countries can join at any time.   Scope    The EPPO is an independent and decentralised prosecution office of the EU with the power to investigate, prosecute and bring to justice (through national courts) crimes against the EU budget, such as  fraud  (over €10,000), corruption or cross-border VAT fraud  above €10 million  .   Existing EU bodies, such as  OLAF  (the European Anti-Fraud Office),  Eurojust  (the European Agency for criminal justice cooperation) and  Europol  (the European Police Office) lack the powers to conduct criminal investigations and prosecutions.The EPPO will establish close relationships with these Union bodies based on mutual cooperation within their respective mandates.    Organisation   The EPPO is built on two levels:   The  central level  consisting of a Central Office at the seat of the EPPO in  Luxembourg  . The central level consists of the European Chief Prosecutor, its two Deputies, the European Prosecutors (one per participating EU country) and the Administrative Director.   The  decentralised level  consisting of  European Delegated Prosecutors  located in the participating EU countries.    Independence    Staff of the EPPO will act in the interest of the EU as a whole and must neither seek nor take instructions from any outside party.   EPPO is structurally independent from any other EU institution or service.   The European Chief Prosecutor is selected following an open call for candidates and will be appointed by the  European Parliament  and the  Council  . The term of office is limited to  7 years  and is not renewable.   The European Chief Prosecutor can be dismissed only by a decision of the  Court of Justice of the EU  , following an application by the European Parliament, the Council or the  Commission  .   The European Delegated Prosecutors must be completely independent from national prosecution authorities.    From when does the regulation apply?   It has applied since 20 November 2017.   background     Judicial cooperation  (  European Commission  )    EPPO  (  European Commission  ).
   Strengthening of maritime labour standards     Strengthening of maritime labour standards     The European Commission intends to consult the social partners on the question of how relevant provisions of the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention on Maritime Labour Standards, adopted in February 2006, should be incorporated into Community law.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 15 June 2006 under Article 138(2) of the EC Treaty on the strengthening of maritime labour standards [       COM(2006) 287      final ‒ Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The European Commission has actively supported the work of preparing the       ILO      Convention on Maritime Labour Standards. It considers implementation of that Convention to be essential not only at Community but also at national level.     Article 138(2) of the Treaty stipulates that before submitting social policy proposals the Commission should consult the       social partners      regarding the possible direction of Community action.      Field of application of the Convention      The Convention draws together a set of provisions aimed at guaranteeing decent living and working conditions on board vessels with a gross tonnage of 500 tonnes or more engaged in international voyages or sailing between foreign ports. The standards it contains address the following points:       minimum conditions required for recruitment;         employment conditions        and workers’ rights;        accommodation on board;         social protection;        a         definition of responsibilities        regarding application of the Convention.       Benefits of the Convention      The primary objective of the ILO Convention is       to consolidate      the conventions and recommendations on maritime labour adopted by the ILO since 1919 into a single text of high legal and political standing. Furthermore, it makes use of innovative mechanisms to ensure that the instrument is fully effective.     The second objective of this Convention is to       manage globalisation and guarantee fairer conditions of competition.      This will help to stabilise the maritime transport sector in the face of global competition and normalise the status of seafarer in the context of globalisation. In fact, certain harmful effects, such as social dumping, penalise seamen and ship owners who comply with the rules in force.     The third objective is to       improve maritime safety and the attractiveness of the profession.      It is worth remembering that 80 % of maritime accidents are linked to human error. There should therefore be minimum social standards in a coherent framework. A review of training should also be carried out, since qualifications and working conditions are complementary.      Role of the EU      The Commission gave its full support to the preparatory work for the Convention from the outset, convinced of the importance of eliminating unfair competition and improving social standards at world level. It has played a dynamic role, providing added value during negotiations and guaranteeing compatibility between the text of the Convention and Community law. It has also coordinated the positions of the Member States and offered financial support.     The Commission is now endeavouring to encourage and to expedite ratification to ensure that the Convention enters into force as early as possible. The weight of the Union, with its 27 Member States, enables the process to be speeded up since the conditions laid down for the entry into force of the Convention call for 30 States accounting for at least 33 % of world tonnage.     In addition, the Commission is striving to develop and enhance Community standards by seeking to incorporate the most relevant provisions of the Convention into Community law.     For this first phase of consultation, the social partners are thus invited to make known their position on a number of issues connected with implementation of the Convention. Those issues, which will also be the subject of an impact assessment, are as follows:      the advisability of developing the existing Community acquis by adapting, consolidating or complementing it in accordance with certain guidelines;       the usefulness of going beyond the provisions of the Convention in Community law;       the relevance of making the non-compulsory part of the Convention binding;       the possible commitment of the social partners to negotiations aimed at reaching an agreement to be implemented by means of Council decision, in accordance with Article 139 of the Treaty.      Furthermore, the Commission is asking the social partners whether it is relevant for the Community’s tripartite structure to be reflected in the monitoring commission provided for by the Convention.      Background      Now that the Convention has been adopted, the European Commission considers it essential to mobilise the necessary resources to implement it at both Community and national level. The Commission is seeking to assert EU values and interests and to promote high standards throughout the world.     RELATED ACTS      Council Decision         2007/431/EC        of 7 June 2007 authorising Member States to ratify, in the interests of the European Community, the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006, of the International Labour Organization [Official Journal L 161 of 22.6.2007].      The Commission has exclusive competence as regards the coordination of social security schemes, but the Community cannot stand in place of the Member States when a convention is ratified. The Council Decision of 7 June 2007 allows the Member States to ratify the Convention, which comprises aspects connected with coordination of social security schemes.     Last updated: 10.01.2008

act   Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: The EU justice agenda for 2020 - Strengthening trust, mobility and growth within the Union (  COM(2014) 144  final of 11.3.2014).   summary    key points   European Union justice policy must ensure that individuals and businesses can benefit fully from a  trusted and fully functioning common European area of justice  .  This communication presents the Commission’s vision for the future of EU justice policy in the form of an EU justice agenda for 2020.   Trust, mobility, growth  : three key challenges need to be addressed in order to create a common area of justice by 2020, as shown below.    Mutual trust  : this is the bedrock on which EU justice policy should be built. Instruments such as the  European Arrest Warrant  or rules on conflict-of-laws issues between EU countries require a high level of mutual trust between national justice authorities. Citizens, legal practitioners and judges must also be able to  fully trust judicial decisions taken by other EU countries  .    Mobility  : Europeans are increasingly taking advantage of the rights conferred on them by the EU treaties. There are currently nearly 14 million EU citizens residing in a EU country of which they are not nationals. However, they still face practical and legal problems when they travel, study, marry, form a family and buy and sell products and services in other EU countries. Justice policy should continue to remove obstacles to EU citizens exercising their right to  move freely and live in any EU country  .    Growth  : EU justice policy should continue to support economic recovery and growth and continue to tackle unemployment. Structural reforms need to be pursued so as to ensure that justice systems are capable of delivering swift, reliable and trustworthy justice. Businesses and consumers need to be confident that they will be able to effectively enforce contracts and handle disputes in court, or where possible out of court, throughout the EU, within a reasonable amount of time.    EU justice agenda for 2020   The Commission proposes tackling these challenges by means of the following methods or a combination of these.    1     Consolidate the existing legal framework  : this would ensure that effective remedies are respected and that EU fundamental rights are defended. Efforts are also needed to improve the use of e-justice and to train judges and legal practitioners.      2     Codify EU law and practice  : this would ensure that EU law is clearer and more consistent for citizens and businesses.      3     Complement the existing legal framework  : where appropriate,  new initiatives  that facilitate citizens’ lives and further contribute to economic growth should be envisaged.

   VAT: special arrangements applicable to services supplied electronically     VAT: special arrangements applicable to services supplied electronically     The objective of this Directive is to create a level playing field for European Union (EU) businesses with regard to the indirect taxation of electronic commerce. The Directive also aims to make compliance for non-EU businesses as easy and straightforward as possible. The changes modernise the existing VAT place-of-supply rules for services by including the electronic commerce sector.     ACT     Council Directive       2002/38/EC      of 7 May 2002 amending and amending temporarily Directive       77/388/EEC      as regards the value added tax arrangements applicable to radio and television broadcasting services and certain electronically supplied services [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     Until now, the       uniform basis of assessment      provided for by the common system of value-added tax (VAT) has not adequately addressed the supply of services delivered electronically because the supply of services in this way was simply not envisaged when the existing tax system was set up. As a result, the application of the prior VAT rules to these transactions produced perverse and discriminatory results. Previously, electronically delivered services originating within the EU were generally subject to VAT irrespective of the place of consumption, while those from outside the EU were not subject to VAT even when delivered within the EU.     The objective of this Directive is to introduce new harmonised rules and thus eliminate distortions in competition for radio and television broadcasting services and electronically supplied services within the EU. The absence of a clear and fair tax regime was a disincentive to investment and put EU business at a competitive disadvantage.     The principal changes in the uniform basis of assessment provided for by the common system of VAT concern the place of taxation for services supplied in electronic form over electronic networks.     Electronically supplied services include services such as cultural, artistic, sporting, scientific, educational, entertainment, information and similar services as well as software, video games and computer services generally. The result is that:      for specified electronically delivered services, when supplied by a non-EU operator to an EU customer, the place of taxation is within the EU and accordingly they are subject to VAT;       when these services are provided by an EU operator to a non-EU customer, the place of taxation is where the customer is located and they are not subject to EU VAT;       when an EU operator provides these services to a business in another Member State, the place of supply is the place where the business customer is established;       where the EU operator provides these services to a private individual in the EU or to a taxable person in the same Member State, the place of supply continues to be where the supplier is located;      Non-EU operators are required to register for VAT purposes only when their business involves sales to final consumers. If they supply to EU businesses (and this covers the vast bulk of such transactions), they face no obligations at all as the business customers account for the VAT themselves on a self-assessment basis under the "reverse charge mechanism".     The simplest and most attractive option for non-EU businesses is to make use of the Directive's simplified scheme for such businesses. This allows them to identify themselves for EU tax purposes in a single European Member State, taking advantage of streamlined compliance and on-line reporting procedures.     Non-EU businesses are able to register with a tax authority in a Member State of their choosing. They are required to charge VAT to non-business customers in the EU according to the standard tax rate in the Member State where the customer lives.     Every three months, they pay the tax they have collected to the administration where they have registered, together with a return in electronic form detailing total sales for each EU Member State. On the basis of this information, the Member State of registration re-allocates tax revenue to the country of the consumer.     This simplified scheme for non-EU businesses is to be applied for three years, with the option of moving towards a more technically advanced scheme.

   Second programme of Community action in the field of health (2008-2013)     Second programme of Community action in the field of health (2008-2013)     The second programme of Community action in the field of health draws on the results of the previous programme. It must therefore help to achieve a high level of protection for the health and safety of European citizens. It aims to improve citizens' health security, promote health and generate and disseminate knowledge and information on the subject. It replaces the previous programme.     ACT     Decision No       1350/2007/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2007 establishing a second programme of Community action in the field of health (2008-2013).     SUMMARY     The       first programme of Community action in the field of public health (2003-2008)      contributed to fundamental improvements in this area.     However, the European Union (EU) must make further efforts to improve the health and safety of its citizens. This Decision therefore establishes a second programme of Community action in the field of health for the period from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2013. It draws on the achievements of the previous programme, which it replaces, and supplements and supports the policies of the Member States.     This second programme has three main objectives:      to improve citizens' health security;       to promote health, which involves reducing inequalities in this area;       to generate and disseminate health information and knowledge.      Actions have been planned to achieve each of the objectives. These actions help to prevent major diseases and lessen their impact. They are set out in the Annex to the Decision.      Financing      The programme has a budget of 321 500 000 euro for the period 2008-2013.      Implementation of the programme      The Commission is responsible for implementing the programme in close cooperation with the Member States.     Within their respective fields of competence, the Commission and the Member States guarantee the efficient running of the programme and create mechanisms for achieving its objectives.     They guarantee the comparability of data and the compatibility of the systems for exchanging health information. They also cooperate with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and with other competent EU agencies.     Lastly, the Commission and the Member States ensure the protection, confidentiality and security of personal data throughout the implementation of the programme.     An annual work schedule for programme implementation is established. It sets the priorities to be respected and the actions to be taken.      Joint strategies and actions      In order to encourage the integration of health into other Community policies and to ensure a high level of health protection, actions in tandem with other Community programmes and actions can be established.      Participation of third countries      The programme is open to:      EFTA/EEA countries (European Free Trade Association/European Economic Area), in accordance with the conditions of the EEA Agreement;       third countries: countries included in the European Neighbourhood Policy, countries applying for accession, candidate accession countries or countries in the process of accession to the EU and the countries of the Western Balkans included in the stabilisation and association process, in accordance with the conditions set by the various bilateral or multilateral agreements.       International cooperation      Cooperation with non-participating third countries and the international organisations competent in the field of public health, such as the World Health Organisation (WHO), is also encouraged.      Comitology      A committee assists the Commission with the implementation of the programme.      Evaluation      The Commission will present an independent external report on the results obtained, the qualitative and quantitative aspects of programme implementation, and its consistency and complementarity with other Community actions and programmes by 31 December 2010 at the latest. Its aim is to assess the impact of the measures taken. The Commission will also present a Communication on the continuation of the programme by 31 December 2011 at the latest, as well as an external ex-post evaluation report on the programme results by 31 December 2015 at the latest.

   Contribution to the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance     Contribution to the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance     The purpose of this communication is to contribute to the debate at the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance (hereafter referred to as the World Conference) by highlighting the measures taken to combat racism in the European Union (EU). To inspire the debate by reiterating the recommendations presented by the Commission at the Regional European Conference in October 2000.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 1 June 2001. Contribution to the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance [       COM(2001)291      final - Not published in the Official Journal]     SUMMARY      Context      The decision to hold a World Conference in 2001 was taken in 1997 by the United Nations General Assembly. Organised by the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, it focused on action-oriented and practical steps to eradicate racism. Its main objectives were to: assess the fight against racial discrimination and its future, increase the level of awareness about racism and its consequences, formulate recommendations to the United Nations (UN) on ways to increase the effectiveness of its actions, etc. The European Commission played an active part in the preparations for the World Conference. On the one hand, it attended the preparatory Conference entitled 'All Different - All Equal: From Principle to Practice' held at the Council of Europe. On the other hand, it contributed EUR 3.7 million to non-governmental organisations (NGOs), the least developed countries (to ensure their participation) and the World Conference itself. It also helped to draw up the political declaration and programme of action adopted at the Conference. It is in this context that this communication was drawn up. It aims to demonstrate the success of the fight against racism in the EU with a view to inspiring the Conference participants to work together within regional groupings.      Actions in the European Union      Action at European level has taken two general forms: a number of legislative acts have been adopted and the fight against racism has been mainstreamed into other policies.      The legislative measures      include efforts to harmonise legislation in the Member States as previously, although discrimination was banned, the scope, content and enforcement of the legislation varied considerably from one country to another. A package of proposals to combat discrimination including two directives and an action programme were thus adopted in 1999. These proposals included Directive       2000/43/EC      implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin. Aimed at preventing racial discrimination in the Union, the directive strengthens the position of victims and requires the establishment of independent bodies capable of conducting surveys and studies in the field. Moreover, in 1996, it was agreed that judicial cooperation should be established between the Member States, so as to prevent, in particular, those responsible for crimes from avoiding prosecution by moving from one Member State to another. Lastly, the Commission has presented five proposals for directives on immigration and asylum issues (since the end of 1999). These relate, in particular, to family reunification, temporary protection in case of mass influx of displaced persons, procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status, the status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents and reception conditions for asylum-seekers.      Mainstreaming in other Community policies      involves the employment policy, the external relations policy and programmes providing financial support.     The European employment strategy pursued by the EU since 1997 is an important instrument in the fight against racism. The employment guidelines which have, since 1999, included the principle of non-discrimination in the labour market, are the EU's own contribution. The Member States are required to pay particular attention to the needs of ethnic minorities and other groups and persons likely to be disadvantaged, and to formulate appropriate policies of prevention and action to promote their integration into the labour market.     The external relations policy deals with racism through the preparations for enlargement (whereby the candidate countries are required to satisfy the Copenhagen criteria and to       combat racism      , especially with regard to the Roma population), the agreements with the New Independent States (NIS), the Common Strategy on Russia and the development policy.     Many EU programmes that provide financial aid contain provisions on racism. These include:      the         Community action programme to combat discrimination        , which has a budget of EUR 100 million for 2001-2006;       the         Community initiative EQUAL        , which deals with discrimination on the labour market and has been allocated almost EUR 3 billion for the 2000-2006 period;       the programme relating to the Community framework strategy on gender equality, which focuses on the situation of women;       the         European Fund for Refugees        , which provides support for the reception, integration and voluntary repatriation of refugees;       the         Grotius programme        , which aims to foster legal cooperation on general and criminal issues between the Member States of the European Union;       external programmes such as those financed by the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (         EIDHR        ), which has a budget of EUR 110 million for 2002,         Phare        , which concentrates on the candidate countries, Tacis, which focuses on the NIS and Mongolia and, finally, projects relating to the Republics of Former Yugoslavia and those organised under the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe;       programmes in the field of education and youth, such as         Socrates        ,         Leonardo da Vinci        and         Youth        together with the Fifth framework programme for research and technological development.       Evaluation, monitoring and analysis of activities in the European Union      In addition to monitoring by the European Commission, which is responsible for ensuring respect for the Treaties and other Community laws, the       European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia      has established a European Racism and Xenophobia Information Network (Raxen). This network, whose task is to gather data and information on racism and xenophobia, incorporates research centres, NGOs and specialised centres, and its activities could be extended to the candidate countries.     Independent evaluation of Community actions and policies is also of importance, especially with a view to ensuring that the efforts made to combat racism are effective. This is a prerequisite for all the projects and actions supported by the programmes listed above.      Commission recommendations      The Commission hopes that the participants in the World Conference take account of the European Union's action against racism as well as the recommendations presented by the Commission at the Regional European Conference in October 2000. These call on all participants to establish or maintain:      a combination of legislation and practical action to combat racism;       cooperation with the NGOs and the social partners;       specific policies involving the host society in order to promote respect for cultural diversity;       practical measures concerning the labour market;       access without discrimination to education and measures to combat discrimination in the media, culture and sport;       research in this area;       systematic mainstreaming of the fight against racism in the external relations and human rights policies;       legislative protection against racial discrimination;       effective, proportionate and deterrent criminal penalties for racist and xenophobic behaviour.      RELATED ACTS      Council Conclusions on the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance. General Affairs Council - 16 July 2001 [Not published in the Official Journal].      The General Affairs Council (GAC) reiterated the European Union's desire to contribute to the success of the World Conference. In its conclusions, the Council stresses that the World Conference might represent a mobilising factor in the fight against racism. To achieve satisfactory results, it is essential for the Action Programme and the Declaration to be forward-looking and oriented towards action. It also emphasises that racism and racial discrimination must be fought by all legal means and it refers to the European Union's many efforts mentioned in the above communication.     The Council thus hopes that the World Conference's priorities include strengthening the legal framework for combating racism and improving education, training and the prevention of racism. Moreover, it calls for greater priority to be given to what is known as multiple racism, in other words cases where an individual belongs to several categories that are subject to discrimination, such as the Roma population, women and disabled people.     In order to ensure the success of the Conference, the Council feels it is necessary for NGOs and other actors in civil society to contribute and for a global strategy aimed at increasing international cooperation to be drawn up.     Deploring the effects of colonialism, such as slavery, the Council highlights the European Union's current efforts to achieve a more just world, in particular through its development cooperation. It concludes by calling on the participating countries to work together in a spirit of cooperation, which is essential if the World Conference is to be a success.

summary of   Regulation (EU) 2015/1588 — the application of Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to certain types of state aid   what is the aim of the regulation   It enables the  European Commission  to adopt regulations to exempt certain categories of  state aid  from the general obligation to first notify the Commission for its approval.   It replaces — as of 14 October 2015 — Council Regulation (EC) No  994/98  on the application of Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) to certain categories of horizontal State aid (i.e. state aid that applies to all industries rather than to a selected one).   key points    In general, any state aid measures granted by EU countries to companies must be notified to the Commission for prior approval.   This regulation allows the Commission to adopt regulations — known as  block exemption regulations  — declaring certain categories of aid to be compatible with Articles 107 and 108 of the TFEU and thus exempt from the normal requirement to notify.   The  categories of exempted aid  include funding provided by EU centrally managed financial instruments and projects supported by  EU Territorial Cooperation programmes  .   For each category of exempted aid, the regulation must include certain  basic information  including the purpose of the aid and the beneficiaries.   Certain types of aid may also be exempted from the usual State aid notification requirements provided the aid to the company in question over a given period of time does not exceed a specified fixed amount — the so-called  de minimis rule  .   EU countries have to guarantee the  transparency and monitoring  of the exempted aid. This includes publication on the Commission website of the aid in question and the submission by the EU country to the Commission of an annual report on the application of the aid.   The regulation allowing the exemption must  apply for a specified period  only. This may be amended if any of the circumstances giving rise to the exemption have changed significantly.   Before the Commission adopts a regulation granting an exemption, it must first publish a draft to allow  interested parties  to submit comments.   The regulation provides for the setting up of an  Advisory Committee on State Aid  composed of representatives from EU countries and chaired by the Commission. The Commission must consult the Committee when it publishes a draft regulation exempting any category of aid and also before final adoption of the regulation.   from when does this regulation apply  It has applied since 14 October 2015.   background   For more information, see:    State aid legislation  (  European Commission  ).
   Development of high-quality, accessible and sustainable health care and long-term   care     Development of high-quality, accessible and sustainable health care and long-term   care     This Communication proposes to extend the "open method of coordination" to health care and long-term care. This will help to establish a framework to promote the sharing of experience and best practice, thus supporting Member States in their efforts to reform health care and long-term care.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 20 April 2004 - Modernising social protection for the development of high-quality, accessible and sustainable health care and long-term care: support for the national strategies using the "open method of coordination" [       COM(2004) 304      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Social protection is a way of distributing, at the level of an entire society, costs which often exceed the means of an individual or his/her family, ensuring that even those on a low income have access to care. The social protection systems in the Member States have considerably reduced the risk of poverty and helped to improve the state of health of the people of Europe. They are therefore an important part of the European social model.     Following the Lisbon and Gothenburg European Councils, which highlighted the need to reform social protection systems, the Commission identified three principles, set out in the Communication of 2001, on       the future of health care and care for the elderly      , that could serve as a basis for this reform: accessibility of care for all, based on fairness and solidarity; high-quality care for the population; and measures to ensure the financial sustainability of this care.     The Commission therefore calls for the coordination of national policies to be stepped up in order to support the modernisation and development efforts in the healthcare sector and calls for a global strategy which would include the other three main areas of social protection: pensions, social inclusion and pay. These areas have been coordinated more closely since 2000.     As set out in the Commission's Communication on       streamlining coordination in the field of social protection      , the social protection systems need to be reformed in an integrated and coordinated way in order to make social protection more coherent and to ensure closer coordination with other political processes such as the       European Employment Strategy      , in particular       the challenges of the ageing workforce      , and the       broad economic policy guidelines      (BEPG).     In this context, the "open method of coordination" will be a vital tool, as it respects the diversity of the national healthcare situations, helps to involve the many actors in this sector and favours a comprehensive, integrated approach to the problems encountered today in the different systems, by establishing a close link with the instruments and policies associated with the field.     On the basis of these guidelines, the Commission is proposing objectives to support the development of the systems in the EU:      ensuring access to care: universal access, fairness and solidarity;       promoting high-quality care;       guaranteeing the financial sustainability of accessible, high-quality care.       Ensuring access to care: universal access, fairness and solidarity      With a view to providing a safety net against poverty or social exclusion associated with ill health, accident, disability or old age, Member States propose to:      ensure access to healthcare based on the principles of universal access, fairness and solidarity, and to ensure the financial and physical accessibility of care systems for disabled persons;       offer specific care for elderly people;       promote palliative and end-of-life care;       reduce regional inequalities in the provision of care;       develop infrastructure, particularly hospitals, with the support of the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund.       Promoting high-quality care      The quality of European healthcare systems must remain a fundamental objective. This calls for a preventive approach and effective management of the care system, on the basis of closer coordination between all the players.     In order to improve people's state of health and quality of life, the Commission feels that Member States should:      promote practices and treatments providing real benefits for health and quality of life;.       evaluate the costs and benefits of drugs, equipment and treatments;       ensure a high level of training;       develop health and safety at work policies based on risk prevention.       Guaranteeing the financial sustainability of accessible, high-quality care      Member States are always faced with the need to ensure proper funding for their care system. In this context, they have long been implementing measures designed to ensure the financial equilibrium of the systems, such as reimbursement rates (in order to encourage responsibility or guide demand in a particular direction), prices and volumes of treatments (in order to control certain products or prescriptions) or the fixing of budgets, particularly in the hospital sector.     The quest for financial sustainability should therefore be based on the development of prevention and guidance policies so as to reduce the need for expensive treatments, on a sustainable rate of expenditure development and on improving the effectiveness of the system by means of decentralisation and involvement of the various players.      Background      The Barcelona European Council (2002) called on the Commission and the Council to examine in detail the issues of access, quality and financial viability with regard to healthcare and long-term care. A questionnaire has been sent to Member States in order to obtain information concerning their approach to these three objectives. The Commission and the Council drew up a joint report on the basis of this questionnaire. Based on this work, the Spring 2003 European Council highlighted the need to step up exchanges and collaboration in this area and, in April 2004, the Commission proposed, in this Communication, to extend the "open method of coordination" to the healthcare and long-term care sector.

   Agenda for a sustainable and competitive European tourism     Agenda for a sustainable and competitive European tourism     Europe is the most attractive tourist destination in the world, and tourism plays a major part in growth and job creation in Europe. The sector's competitiveness is closely linked to its sustainability, as the quality of tourist destinations is very much influenced by their natural environment and their local community. For this reason it is necessary to take a holistic approach, addressing not only the economic prosperity of the sector, but also social cohesion, environmental protection and promotion of the culture of European tourist destinations.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 19 October 2007 – Agenda for a sustainable and competitive European tourism [       COM(2007) 621      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This Communication is the official launching and endorsement of an Agenda for sustainable and competitive tourism. The objectives of this Agenda are to deliver economic prosperity, social equity and cohesion and environmental and cultural protection.     These involve several       challenges      for the sector, including:      ensuring the safety of tourists and local communities;       protecting the natural and cultural resources of tourist destinations;       minimising resource use and pollution in tourism destinations;       managing change in the interests of the wellbeing of the community;       reducing the seasonality of demand;       addressing the environmental impact of transport linked to tourism;        making tourism experiences accessible to all        , without discrimination;       improving the quality of tourism jobs.      The objectives of the Agenda will be achieved by means of appropriate       policies      such as sustainable destination management (for example, through spatial and land use planning or investment decisions on infrastructure and services), the       integration of sustainability concerns by businesses      and raising awareness of sustainability among tourists.     To achieve competitive and sustainable tourism the Commission proposes the following       principles      :      taking a holistic and integrated approach in order to ensure that tourism is well balanced and respectful of society and the environment;       planning for the long term, with an eye to the needs of future generations as well as our own;       achieving an appropriate pace of development, respecting the character of tourist destinations;       involving all stakeholders;       using the best available knowledge and sharing it across Europe;       minimising and managing risk (         precautionary principle        ), i.e. taking preventative action to avoid damage to the environment or society;       reflecting impacts in costs (user and polluter pay) – prices should reflect the real costs to society of consumption and production activities;       setting and respecting limits, where appropriate – it is sometimes necessary to evaluate the capacity of tourist destinations and to limit the amount of tourism development;       undertaking continuous monitoring – sustainability means being alert all the time.      All tourism stakeholders in Europe are called upon to participate in the implementation of this Agenda: public authorities at all levels, businesses, tourists, educational and research establishments, trade unions, consumer associations, NGOs and international organisations. The Commission, for its part, plans to implement all of the actions set out below.      Mobilising actors to produce and share knowledge      Best practice related to sustainability and competitiveness must be shared. For this reason the Commission actively supports or will actively support the following initiatives:      the organisation of conferences and studies and the publication of a tourism learning area handbook;       cooperation between universities, research institutes, public and private observatories, tourism education and transnational training;       the creation of alliances between different types of destinations, the strengthening or the creation of platforms;       the organisation of the         annual European Tourism Forum        ;       the use of the annual reports from Member States;       the collection and provision of statistical and geographic data and the activity of observatories;       the sharing of best practice with international organisations.       Promoting destinations of excellence      The Commission will continue to implement the “       European Destinations of Excellence      ” (EDEN) initiative. It will also continue to promote Europe as a sustainable, quality destination. It will work towards this with the       European Travel Commission      and the national tourism organisations, and will lend greater support to the       European Destination Tourism Portal      .      Mobilising EU financial instruments      Tourism projects may receive funding from several Community funds, including:      the         Cohesion Fund        (in particular the         European Regional Development Fund        and the         European Social Fund        );       the         European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development        ;       the         European Fisheries Fund        ;       the         7th Framework Programme for Research        ;       the         Leonardo da Vinci Programme        ;       the         Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme        .       Mainstreaming sustainability and competitiveness in Commission policies      Several Community policies can have an effect on tourism and its sustainability: environment, transport, employment or research. These policies have different impacts depending on the region. The Commission will take into account the specific needs of the areas, whether coastal areas, mountainous areas, rural areas or urban areas.

summary of   Regulation (EU) 2018/1807 — on a framework for the free flow of non-personal data in the European Union   what is the aim of the regulation   It aims to ensure that electronic data, apart from personal data, can be processed freely throughout the EU.   It bans restrictions on where the data can be stored or processed.   key points   The regulation applies to the processing of  non-personal data   *  which is:   provided as a service to users living in the EU;   conducted by an individual, company or organisation in the EU for its own needs.   The regulation bans measures known as  localisation requirements   *  , restricting data processing to a specific territory in the EU, except on public security grounds.   EU countries  must:   inform the  European Commission  immediately of any potential new data localisation requirement;   by  30 May 2021  , repeal any unjustified localisation requirements or notify the Commission of any it believes are justified;   establish a  national online single information point  containing all up-to-date localisation requirements;   appoint a  single contact point  to liaise and cooperate with counterparts in other EU countries and the Commission, particularly on assistance requests.    Public authorities  may request access to data located in another EU country, or stored or processed in the cloud, and required for their official duties.  The  Commission  must:   publish links to the national online single information points on its website and update regularly a consolidated list of localisation requirements;   by  29 May 2019  , provide guidance on the interaction between the regulation and Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the  processing and transfer of personal data  , especially data with both personal and non-personal information;   by  29 November 2022  , report to the  European Parliament  , the  Council  and the  European Economic and Social Committee  on how the regulation is being applied.   The Commission encourages the creation of  EU-level self-regulatory codes of conduct  . These should:   be developed in close cooperation with interested parties, such as  small- and medium-sized enterprise  associations, start-ups, users and cloud service providers;   be completed by  29 November 2019  so they can be implemented by  29 May 2020  ;   cover    best practices  when switching service providers or  porting data   *     minimum information requirements  for professional users before signing a data-processing contract    certification schemes  to enable comparisons between data-processing products and services for professionals    communication  to raise awareness of the codes of conduct.     from when does the regulation apply  It applies from 18 June 2019. As mentioned in the summary, there are specific deadlines in the regulation that must be met such as the repeal, by 30 May 2021, of any unjustified localisation requirements.   background   The new rules are designed to make it easier to do business across borders in the EU and to create a single market for data storage and processing services, such as cloud computing.  The ability to choose a data service provider anywhere in the EU should lead to more innovative data-driven services and more competitive prices for businesses, consumers and public administrations.  With a favourable regulatory environment, it is estimated the data economy could be worth 4% of EU GDP (gross domestic product) by 2020.  For more information, see:    Free flow of non-personal data  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Non-personal data:  any information not linked to an identified or identifiable individual, that is any data other than personal data as defined in point (1) of Article 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).   Localisation requirements:  any legal or administrative measure which states that data processing must take place in a specific EU territory.   Porting data:  transferring data from one service provider to another, or back to a company’s own servers.   related document   Regulation (EU)  2016/679  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, pp. 1-88)  See  consolidated version  .
summary of   EU Charter of Fundamental Rights   what is the aim of the charter  It enshrines in European Union (EU) law a range of personal, civil, political, economic and social rights of EU citizens and residents.   key points    Content   The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the Charter) reaffirms, with due regard for the EU’s powers and tasks and for the principle of  subsidiarity  , the rights as they result, in particular, from the constitutional traditions and international obligations common to EU countries, the  European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms  , the Social Charters adopted by the EU and by the  Council of Europe  and the case-law of the  Court of Justice of the European Union  and of the  European Court of Human Rights  . By making fundamental rights clearer and more visible, it creates  legal certainty  within the EU.  The Charter of Fundamental Rights contains a preamble and 54 articles, grouped in 7 chapters:   chapter I:  dignity  (human dignity, the right to life, the right to the integrity of the person, prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, prohibition of slavery and forced labour);   chapter II:  freedoms  (the right to liberty and security, respect for private and family life,  protection of personal data  , the right to marry and found a family, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and information, freedom of assembly and association, freedom of the arts and sciences, the right to education, freedom to choose an occupation and the right to engage in work, freedom to conduct a business, the right to property, the  right to asylum  , protection in the event of removal, expulsion or extradition);   chapter III:  equality  (equality before the law,  non-discrimination  , cultural, religious and linguistic diversity,  equality between men and women  , the  rights of the child  , the rights of the elderly, integration of persons with disabilities);   chapter IV:  solidarity  (  workers’ right to information and consultation within the undertaking  , the right of collective bargaining and action, the right of access to placement services, protection in the event of unjustified dismissal, fair and just working conditions, prohibition of child labour and protection of young people at work, family and professional life, social security and social assistance, health care, access to  services of general economic interest  , environmental protection, consumer protection);   chapter V:  citizens’ rights  (the right to vote and stand as a candidate at elections to the  European Parliament  and at  municipal elections  , the right to good administration, the  right of access to documents  ,  European Ombudsman  , the  right to petition  , freedom of movement and residence,  diplomatic and consular protection  );   chapter VI:  justice  (the right to an effective remedy and a  fair trial  , presumption of innocence and the right of defence, principles of legality and proportionality of criminal offences and penalties, the right not to be tried or punished twice in criminal proceedings for the same criminal offence);   chapter VII:  general provisions  .    Scope   The charter applies to the European institutions, subject to the principle of subsidiarity, and may under no circumstances extend the powers and tasks conferred on them by the  treaties  . The charter also applies to EU countries when they implement EU law.  If any of the rights correspond to rights guaranteed by the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights, the meaning and scope of those rights is to be the same as defined by the convention, though EU law may provide for more extensive protection.   Annual reports   Every year since 2010, the  European Commission  publishes an  annual report  . This monitors progress on the application of the charter.   background    In 1999, the  European Council  concluded that the fundamental rights applicable at EU level should be consolidated in a charter to give them greater visibility.   The charter was formally proclaimed in Nice in December 2000 by the European Parliament, the  Council  and the Commission.   The Charter became legally binding on the EU with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, in December 2009 and now has the same legal value as the EU treaties.   For more information, see:    EU charter of fundamental rights  on the European Commission’s website.
act   Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - Addressing the challenges of deforestation and forest degradation to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss (  COM(2008) 645 final  of 17.10.2008)   summary    what does this communication do  In this paper, the European Commission sets out lines of action for the European Union response to deforestation, invites contributions from stakeholders, and aims to kick-start initial actions that create the foundations of a global response to deforestation.   key points    The EU calls for a halt to global forest cover loss (i.e. a change from a forest to a non-forest state) by 2030 at the latest and for tropical deforestation to be reduced by at least 50 % by 2020 as compared to current levels.   It considers that the fight against deforestation must take place on several levels. These range from strengthening national and local forest governance and improving monitoring mechanisms, to taking into account consumer demand and creating financial incentives to preserve forests. This action must take place within the framework of international agreements, such as the UN’s  Convention on Biodiversity  and  Framework Convention on Climate Change  .   It shows that policies already in place in the EU can help tackle deforestation, such as the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (  FLEGT  );  green public procurement  ;  eco-labelling  ; and work carried out in the framework of the Global Climate Change Alliance (  GCCA  ).   It indicates how proceeds from the Emissions Trading System (  EU ETS  ) could be used to help fund the fight against deforestation.   It proposes the setting up of a global mechanism for incentivising the preservation of tropical forests, which has become  REDD+  (i.e. Reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation, including through afforestation, conservation and sustainable management of forests).   background   Covering roughly 30 % of the world’s land (and 40 % of the EU’s land mass), forests are integral to environmental health. They provide important habitats for biodiversity, crucial services such as erosion prevention, water purification and carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) storage and sustain the livelihoods of 1.6 billion people globally.  Meanwhile, forests are under threat from deforestation, which destroys 13 million hectares every year according to the  Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations  (FAO). The main causes of this are conversion to agriculture and poorly controlled infrastructure development.

   Community policy on digital video broadcasting     Community policy on digital video broadcasting     Digital technologies open up major prospects for the future of television and, more generally, for the future electronic information highways or integrated broadband communications, in which digital television can play a pivotal role. The Council therefore considers that digital technologies need to be introduced onto the market in a harmonious fashion, and that this will be best achieved by means of a consensus process involving all the relevant economic agents.     ACT     Council resolution of 27 June 1994 on a framework for Community policy on digital video broadcasting [Official Journal C 181 of 02.07.1994].     SUMMARY     This Council resolution stresses the importance of digital technology for the future of television. First, common standards must be adopted to allow harmonious introduction of digital television on the market. Conditional access is another important matter for the providers and consumers of pay-television services and for the rights holders of programmes. Fair and open competition must therefore be ensured in this area in order to protect the interests of the consumer and minimize the possibility of piracy.     The Council declares that the preferred way to achieve the objective of harmonious development of the market is to reach a consensus between all concerned, including broadcasting organizations. In the absence of such a consensus or if necessary to ensure fair and open competition, to protect consumers or safeguard a public interest, the Council is willing to introduce regulatory measures.     The consultations with industry on conditional access must continue in order to determine which additional measures are required.     The Council welcomes the Commission's intention:      to include research and development activities on digital television in its proposals for the specific programmes under the fourth framework programme;       to encourage standardization of digital television;       to encourage and monitor the development of implementation scenarios for digital video broadcasting;       to encourage studies;       to maintain a dialogue with the third parties concerned.      Finally, the Council calls on the Commission to monitor and report to it on all relevant developments. Proposals for appropriate action are expected as soon as they are felt necessary and useful and, in any event, before 1 July 1995.

   Exposure to biological agents     Exposure to biological agents     1) OBJECTIVE     To establish specific minimum requirements designed to guarantee a better standard of safety and health for workers exposed to biological agents at work.     2) ACT     Council Directive       90/679/EEC      of 26 November 1990 on the protection of workers from risks related to exposure to biological agents at work (seventh individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive       89/391/EEC)      [Official Journal L 374 of 31.12.1990].     Amended by the following acts:     Council Directive       93/88/EEC      of 12 October 1993 [Official Journal L 268 of 29.10.1993];     Commission Directive       95/30/EC      of 30 June 1995 [Official Journal L 155 of 06.07.1995];     Commission Directive       97/59/EC      of 7 October 1997 [Official Journal L 282 of 15.10.1997];     Commission Directive       97/65/EC      of 26 November 1997 [Official Journal L 335 of 06.12.1997].     Directive       2000/54/EC      [Official Journal L 262 of 17.10.2000] codifies Directive       90/679      as well as its successive amendments. It therefore repeals these different Directives and replaces them.     3) SUMMARY     1.Definition of terms - "Biological agents": micro-organisms, including those which have been genetically modified, cell cultures and human endoparasites which may be able to provoke any infection, allergy or toxicity. They are classified into four groups according to their level of risk of infection. "Micro-organism": a microbiological entity capable of replication or of transferring genetic material. "Cell culture": the in-vitro growth of cells derived from multicellular organisms.     2. Determination and assessment of risks:      the nature, degree and duration of workers' exposure must be determined for any activity likely to involve a risk;       the risk is assessed on the basis of the danger presented by all hazardous biological agents present and on the basis of all available information on all activities involving exposure to several groups of agents. The assessment is renewed regularly;      3. Employers' obligations     3.1 Replacement     Replacement of a dangerous biological agent by one which is not dangerous or less dangerous, if the nature of the activity so permits.     3.2 Reduction of risks     Exposure to risks must be prevented. Where this is not technically practicable, the exposure risk must be reduced to as low a level as necessary. Nine ways of doing this are listed, e.g. limiting the number of workers exposed, collective and/or individual protection measures, means for safe collection, storage and disposal of waste by workers.     3.3. Information for the competent authority:      Where there is a risk, information to be supplied on:          the results of the assessment,           the activities in which workers may have been exposed,           the number of workers exposed,           the name and powers of the person responsible for safety and health,           the protective and preventive measures taken,           an emergency plan in the event of exposure to a group 3 or 4 agent;         Immediate information on any accident or incident which may have resulted in the release of an agent and which could cause severe human infection and/or illness;       Where the undertaking ceases activity, a list of workers exposed and their medical records to be made available to the competent authority.      3.4 Hygiene and individual protection     Five types of measure to be applied without cost to workers:      Workers not to eat or drink in working areas subject to risk;       Protective clothing to be supplied;       Adequate washing and toilet facilities to be provided, possibly with skin antiseptics and eye washes;       All protective equipment to be properly stored, checked and cleaned, and repaired or replaced;       Procedures for taking, handling and processing samples.      3.5 Information and training of workers on the potential risks to health, precautions to be taken, hygiene requirements, the use of protective equipment and clothing, and the steps to be taken by workers in the case of incidents and to prevent them.     3.6 Worker information in particular cases      Written instructions containing at least the procedure to be followed in the event of a serious accident or incident or for handling a group 4 agent;       Immediate information in the event of any accident or incident which may have resulted in the release of a group 3 or 4 biological agent, including the cause and the measures taken or to be taken;       Workers must immediately report any accident or incident involving the handling of a biological agent. They must have access to the information contained in the list of workers exposed, i.e. information which relates to them personally and anonymous collective information.      3.7 List of workers exposed to group 3 and/or 4 agents:     The employer indicates the type of work and the agent concerned. The list is kept for at least 10 years after the end of exposure and, in some cases, for up to 40 years after the last known exposure.     3.8 Consultation and participation of workers in connection with matters covered by the Directive.     3.9 Notification to the competent authority prior to the first use of group 2, 3 and 4 biological agents and whenever there are substantial changes of importance to safety or health.     4. Miscellaneous provisions     Health surveillance of workers subjected to risks prior to exposure and at regular intervals thereafter. Practical recommendations are given in Annex IV. If necessary, effective vaccines should be made available. Individual medical records are kept for at least 10 years after the end of exposure and in some cases for up to 40 years. The doctor responsible proposes any protective or preventive measures to be taken in respect of any worker. Workers have access to the results of the health surveillance which concern them and may request a review. All cases of diseases or death must be notified to the competent authority.     Health and veterinary care facilities other than diagnostic laboratories. These must specify appropriate decontamination and disinfection procedures and implement procedures enabling contaminated waste to be handled and disposed of without risk. Containment measures must be selected (Annex V, column A) to minimise the risk of infection in isolation facilities where there are human patients or animals infected with group 3 or 4 agents.     Special containment measures are applicable to industrial processes, laboratories and laboratory animal rooms.     Use of data. The Commission has access to the processing operations carried out by the competent national authorities based on cases of disease or death.     The Directive is without prejudice to the Directives on the confined use (90/219/EEC) and voluntary release (90/220/EEC) of genetically modified organisms.

   Supplementary protection certificate for plant protection products     Supplementary protection certificate for plant protection products     The European Union is stepping up safeguards for plant protection research and innovation. It is creating a supplementary protection certificate for plant protection products granted marketing authorisation. This certificate can be obtained by the holder of a national or European patent under the same conditions in each Member State.     ACT     Regulation (EC) No       1610/96      of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the creation of a supplementary protection certificate for plant protection products       *      SUMMARY     The Regulation defines the characteristics of the supplementary protection certificate       *      and lays down the conditions for obtaining a certificate.     The certificate is issued for:      any product protected by a basic patent         *        in force;       any plant protection product that has been granted marketing authorisation (this must be the first marketing authorisation) in accordance with         Directive 91/414/EEC        or an earlier provision of national law;       any product that has not already been the subject of a certificate.      The certificate confers the same rights as those conferred by the basic patent and is subject to the same limitations and obligations.     The certificate is granted to the holder of the basic patent or his successor in title.     The application for a certificate must be lodged:      within six months of the date on which marketing authorisation was granted for the plant protection product;       with the competent industrial property office of the Member State which granted the basic patent or on whose behalf it was granted and in which the marketing authorisation was obtained.      The Regulation provides for publication of the fact that the certificate has been granted.     Member States may require that the certificate be subject to the payment of annual fees.     The duration of the certificate may not exceed five years from the date on which it takes effect.     The certificate lapses:      on expiry of its period of validity;       if the certificate-holder surrenders it;       if the annual fee is not paid in time;       if the marketing authorisation is withdrawn.      The certificate is invalid if:      it was granted contrary to the provisions set out above;       the basic patent has lapsed before its lawful term expires;       the basic patent is revoked or limited.      Any person may submit an application or bring an action for the certificate to be declared invalid.       Key terms used in the act         Plant protection products: active substances and preparations containing one or more active substances which do one or more of the following:         a) protect plants or plant products against all harmful organisms or prevent the action of such organisms;         b) influence the life processes of plants, other than as a nutrient (e.g. plant growth regulators);         c) preserve plant products, in so far as such substances or products are not subject to special provisions on preservatives;         d) destroy undesirable plants; or         e) destroy parts of plants, check or prevent undesirable growth of plants.

summary of   Council Decision 2005/671/JHA on the exchange of information and cooperation concerning terrorist offences   what does this decision do  The  fight against terrorism  is one of the priority objectives of the European Union (EU). This decision sets out a procedure for the sharing of information on criminal investigations, prosecutions and convictions for terrorist offences among EU countries.   key points    To fight against terrorism, it is essential for the relevant services to have the fullest and most up-to-date information possible. EU countries should gather information concerning criminal investigations, prosecutions and convictions for terrorist offences, which affect 2 or more EU countries, and transmit it to  Europol  or  Eurojust  , as appropriate.   A designated specialised service from within a country’s law enforcement authorities is responsible for sending all relevant information arising from criminal investigations for terrorist offences to Europol, including:   the identity of the person or group;   the acts under investigation and the circumstances;   the offence;   links with other relevant cases;   the use of communication technologies;   the threat posed by the possession of weapons of mass destruction.     At least one authority in each country is designated as Eurojust’s national correspondent for terrorism matters, and is responsible for sending all relevant information concerning terrorist prosecutions and convictions to Eurojust, including:   the identity of the person or group under criminal investigation or subject to prosecution;   the offence concerned and its specific circumstances;   information about final convictions for terrorist offences and the specific circumstances surrounding those offences;   links with other relevant cases;   requests for judicial assistance to or from an EU country, and any response.     Each EU country ensures that relevant information from documents or other evidence obtained during investigations or terrorist proceedings is made available as soon as possible to other EU countries.   Where appropriate, countries should set up  joint investigation teams  to conduct investigations. Requests from other EU countries for legal assistance and enforcement of judgments should be given top priority.   The decision should not jeopardise the safety of individuals or the success of an ongoing investigation or specific intelligence operation, and does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve its objectives.   Council Recommendation  2007/562/EC  concerns the sharing of information on terrorist kidnappings among EU countries.   from when does the decision apply  It applies from 30 September 2005.   background   For more information, see    ‘Crisis & Terrorism’  on the European Commission's website    ‘Fight against terrorism’  on the website of the Council of the European Union.
summary of   Regulation (EU) 2019/128 establishing a European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop)   what is the aim of the regulation   It  repeals and replaces  Regulation (EEC) No  337/75  which, in 1975, established the  European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop)  .   It adapts the rules concerning Cedefop to take into account as far as possible its tripartite nature. It is governed by a board comprising representatives of:   EU countries’ governments;   employers and workers of EU countries —  social partners  ; and   the  European Commission  .     key points    Objective   As one of the EU’s  decentralised agencies  , Cedefop’s objective is to support the Commission, other EU institutions and organisations, the EU countries and the social partners in promoting, developing and implementing EU policies in the field of  vocational education and training  , as well as skills and qualifications policies.  It seeks to meet this objective by:   enhancing and disseminating knowledge;   providing evidence and services for the purpose of policy making, including research-based conclusions; and   facilitating knowledge sharing among and between interested parties at EU and national levels.    Tasks   While fully respecting EU countries’ own responsibilities, Cedefop:   analyses trends in vocational education and training, skills and qualification policies and systems, and provides comparative analyses thereof across countries;   analyses labour market trends in relation to skills and qualifications, and vocational education and training;   analyses and contributes to developments related to the design and award of qualifications;   analyses and contributes to developments in the field of validation of  non-formal and informal learning  ;   studies and researches relevant socio-economic developments and related policy issues;   provides forums for sharing experiences and information between the governments, the social partners and other stakeholders at national level;   contributes to the implementation of reforms and policies at national level;   disseminates information with a view to contributing to policies and to raising awareness and understanding of the potential of vocational education and training in promoting the employability of people, productivity and  lifelong learning  ;   manages and makes available tools, datasets and services to citizens, companies, policy makers, the social partners and other stakeholders;   establishes a strategy for relations with non-EU countries and international organisations concerning matters for which it is competent.

   Iceland – Education and culture     Iceland – Education and culture     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM(2011) 666      final – SEC(2011) 1202 final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The       2011 Report      highlights that Iceland has already put in place most of the European Union (EU)       acquis      on education and culture. The country applies these provisions due to its membership of the       European Economic Area      (EEA).      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission’s words)      The fields of education, training,       youth      and       culture      are primarily the competence of the Member States. A framework for cooperation on policies relating to education and training has been adopted with a view to converging national policies and achieving joint objectives through an open method of coordination. It came out of the work programme ‘Education and Training 2010’, which brings together all the actions in the field of education and training at European level.     Furthermore, Member States must take into account the principles stated in the Treaty and ensure that their international commitments contribute towards preserving and promoting cultural diversity. It requires Member States to equip themselves with a legal, administrative and financial framework and the implementation capacities necessary for ensuring sound financial management of European Union programmes related to education, training and youth.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      Iceland has achieved a high level of political and legislative alignment in the fields of education and culture.

act   Directive  2006/115/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on rental right and lending right and on certain rights related to copyright in the field of intellectual property (codified version).   summary   EU countries must introduce laws granting the right to authorise or prohibit the rental and lending of originals and copies of copyright works.   Rental means making available for use, for a limited period of time and for direct or indirect economic or commercial advantage.   Lending means making available for use, for a limited period of time and not for direct or indirect economic or commercial advantage, when it is made through establishments which are accessible to the public.    Owners of right   The holders of rental and lending rights are the authors, including the principal directors of films, performers, phonogram producers or film producers. The transfer of the rights of performers appearing in films is governed by special rules.   Termination or transfer of right   Where an author or performer has transferred or assigned his rental right concerning a phonogram or an original or copy of a film, he retains the right to be paid an equitable amount for its rental. This right cannot be waived. However, its administration may be delegated to collecting societies representing authors or performing artists.   Derogation to lending right   EU countries may derogate from the exclusive lending right, provided that at least authors obtain payment for such lending. EU countries are free to determine this payment taking account of their cultural promotion objectives.   Neighbouring rights to copyright   As regards rights related to copyright, EU countries must ensure that performers and broadcasting organisations are granted exclusive rights of fixation. EU countries must ensure that performers have the exclusive right of broadcasting and communicating to the public for in respect of their live performances. The broadcasting or communication to the public of a phonogram published for commercial purposes entitles performers and producers to remuneration. Broadcasting organisations have the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit the rebroadcasting of their broadcasts, as well as the communication to the public of their broadcasts if it takes place in public areas and an entrance fee is paid.  EU countries must ensure that performers phonogram producers, producers of the first fixations of films and broadcasting organisations have an exclusive right to make available to the public, by sale or otherwise, fixations of their performances, their phonograms, the original and copies of their films and fixations of their broadcasts. This distribution right is exhausted within the EU where the first sale of these objects is made either by the right holder or with his consent.  EU countries may provide for limitations to related rights in respect of private use, use of short excerpts or certain other uses.  Protection of copyright-related rights under the directive must in no way affect the protection of copyright.

Besides the topics common to all domains, the data sets must cover the following  topics  :   job tenure, work biography and previous work experience;   working conditions including working hours and working time arrangements;   participation in education and training;   income, consumption and elements of wealth (e.g. house ownership), including debts;   living conditions, including material deprivation, housing, living environment and access to services;   quality of life, including social, civil, economic and cultural participation, inclusion and well-being;   participation in the information society, and   allocation of time (optional).     Delegated  and  implementing acts    The  European Commission  may adopt delegated acts to:   amend the detailed themes listed in Annex I to take into account relevant developments and to respond to new user needs;   put in place and adapt a multiannual rolling plan covering 8 years; and   define the number and title of variables to be collected.   The Commission may adopt implementing acts on the  technical specifications  of:   data sets;   technical formats for the transmission of information;   characteristics of sampling frames;   quality reports; and   technical characteristics for items common to several datasets.   EU countries must start transmitting the data to the Commission (  Eurostat  ) in line with this regulation from 2021.  Five  annexes  provide detailed information on:   topics to be covered;   accuracy requirements;   sample characteristics;   frequency; and   deadlines for data transmission.    Pilot and feasibility studies   The Commission will launch feasibility and pilot studies with a view to improving the quality of the data sets and social indicators. These studies, funded by the Commission, would cover:   data comparability,   developing new methodologies,   modernising data collection, and   users’ new demands, especially addressing populations that are difficult to reach, data on specific sub‐populations, in particular those that are the most vulnerable, making available statistics at  NUTS 2 territorial level  , and producing data at detailed local level in a cost‐effective and responsive manner.   In accordance with the EU’s  Financial Regulation  (Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046), where appropriate, the EU can provide grants to EU countries, in particular for capacity‐building.   from when does the regulation apply  It applies from 1 January 2021. However, in respect of the domains of time use and of consumption, it applies from 1 January 2025.   background   For more information, see:    People in the EU — statistics on household and family structures  (  Eurostat  ).   key terms    Household:  a social unit:   having common arrangements;   sharing household expenses or daily needs;   in a shared common residence.    A household includes either one person living alone or a group of people, not necessarily related, living at the same address with common housekeeping, i.e. sharing at least one meal per day or sharing a living or sitting room.    Private household:  a social unit that is not a collective/institutional household such as a military barracks or a residential home for older people.
   Globalisation and the information society: the need for strengthened international coordination     Globalisation and the information society: the need for strengthened international coordination     To meet the new challenges of globalisation, this communication identifies the areas relevant to telecommunications and new electronic services which require strengthened international cooperation. The objective is to reach wider agreement at international level on how to proceed with a view to creating a frontier-free electronic market while respecting the public interest.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 4 February 1998 to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: "The Globalisation of the Information Society: the need for strengthened international coordination" [       COM(98) 50      final - not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     A truly       global electronic market      is emerging. Its origins are to be found in the strong growth witnessed over the last two decades in the field of telephony and, more recently, GSM mobile communications. This development has been accompanied by rapidly falling prices in the wake of lower costs and more intense competition, and by the rapid development of data networks, especially the Internet.     About a hundred countries are now connected to the Internet. At the last count there were about 20 million "Internet hosts" worldwide. It is estimated that there will be 250 million Internet users by the year 2000. These developments mean that communications are not solely a global commercial activity, but are also supporting the globalisation and networking of economic activities.     Various public bodies (ITU, ISO, ETSI, CEPT etc.) have been created in the       telecommunications sector      to supervise agreements on technical issues and promote the interconnection and interoperability of networks, standards and national frequencies.     The Internet community is working towards open standards that will permit interoperability and competition. The existence of open standards is proving particularly important with regard to hardware and software tools required for accessing and using the Internet.     The electronic market will boost globalisation, which, as international trade data show, is gaining in intensity. The share of the world income has more than tripled since 1950.     A number of agreements have given additional impetus to these trends, especially those concluded under the auspices of the WTO, and the GATT, GATS and TRIPS agreements which, together with the recent agreement on telecommunications services, will continue to play an important role in trade liberalisation.     One of the major obstacles to the development of advanced communication services is the high cost of telecommunications. However, cost reductions associated with competition are pushing tariffs down, creating a single world infrastructure where physical distances are of diminishing importance.     The principle is that the legal frameworks governing the "off-line" world will have to be applied to the "on-line" world, and that public interest will need to be protected in an appropriate manner. However, the technical possibilities of open networks such as the Internet are already testing existing legal structures in numerous fields (taxation, intellectual property, legal competence, labour law, data protection, consumer protection, etc.).     The on-line world economy requires a suitable framework covering technical, commercial and legal aspects. This should encourage the       interoperability      of technical solutions and competitive practices and the application of compatible rules. However, there is no need for detailed harmonised rules on all aspects.     The above analysis clearly shows that these issues have growing       legal implications      . It is therefore becoming more and more essential to solve them on a worldwide basis since the uncertainties surrounding the various solutions will constitute obstacles to the development of a worldwide electronic market.     For the moment, a detailed examination of the problems and priorities is urgently required, so that the international community can tackle them in a systematic, coordinated manner.     Opportunities for exchange of information (round tables of national experts from the Member States, forums etc.) can help identify and solve problems.     Wherever possible, the Commission will support activities which give all concerned the opportunity to make their views known in a more coordinated way and to exchange information.     It is also important, however, to make these opinions known to policy decision makers at world level. These issues should be brought up at international ministerial events to be held in 1998 and an international ministerial conference should be organised for the end of 1998 or the beginning of 1999.     All those concerned should consider the options for concerted actions. It is not a question of establishing a new international monitoring authority or a set of binding rules. Rather, they will have to reach a forward-looking agreement geared towards the best means of devising common approaches to the problems and their solutions, i.e. developing an ongoing coordination procedure which takes appropriate account of public and private interests.     This could be done at multilateral level under an international charter which would:      contain a multilateral agreement on a method of coordination, aimed at dismantling the obstacles to worldwide electronic trading;       have non-binding legal status;       take into account the work already being done by existing international authorities;       encourage the participation of the private sector and of the social groups concerned;       contribute to greater regulatory transparency.

summary of   Regulation (EU) 2016/369 on the provision of emergency support within the EU   what is the aim of the regulation  Regulation (EU) 2016/369:   aims to provide a set of rules for emergency  humanitarian support   *  for EU countries during man-made or natural disasters;   comes into play when other instruments prove insufficient;   supports and complements the actions of the affected EU country or countries.   Following the  COVID-19 outbreak  in 2020, the  Council  adopted Regulation (EU)  2020/521  activating  emergency support measures  under Regulation (EU) 2016/369. The activation period is from 1 February 2020 to 31 January 2022.   key points    The  Emergency Support Instrument  (ESI) created under this regulation is based on needs and is meant to preserve life, prevent human suffering and maintain human dignity.   The Council decides on the activation of emergency support under this regulation based on a proposal by the  European Commission  .   The Commission must monitor actions that have received funding and present an overall assessment of the support provided during a given activation, or proposals to end support, to the Council at the latest 12 months after the activation of the emergency support.   The Commission must ensure that funds used under this regulation are not affected by fraud, corruption or any other illegal activities that may harm the financial interests of the EU.   This regulation is meant to complement other EU funding instruments, such as the  Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund  , the  Internal Security Fund  and the  Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived  .    Special COVID-19 measures    Through the ESI, the EU is mobilising  €2.7 billion  . This is to be used to fund  emergency healthcare support  such as:   jointly procuring, stockpiling and distributing essential resources;   boosting the development of medication and testing methods;   creating temporary hospitals and setting up temporary quarantine facilities; and   assisting the transporting of patients cross-border to hospitals with free capacity.     It will also be possible to fund other actions depending on the evolving needs of EU countries, hospitals, doctors and patients.   The Commission may fund  partner organisations  , such as non‐governmental organisations, specialised services of EU countries, national authorities and other public bodies, international organisations and their agencies.   The range of potential beneficiaries of financial assistance for implementing ESI-funded actions has been widened due to the  COVID-19  pandemic. Where appropriate and necessary for the implementation of an action, organisations and entities with the necessary expertise, or active in the disaster relief sector may be eligible, such as:   private service providers;   equipment manufacturers; and   scientists and research institutions.     The different options available for  procuring supplies and services  needed for providing emergency support include:   joint procurement by the Commission and EU countries;   procurement by the Commission on behalf of EU countries;   procurement by the Commission; and   sale, donation or rental of the procured supplies or services to EU countries or partner organisations selected by the Commission.     ESI financing can cover up to 100% of  direct and indirect costs  related to ESI-funded actions until the end of the activation period. Direct costs can include:   the purchase, preparation, collection, transport, storage and distribution of goods and services; and   investment costs of actions or projects directly related to achieving the aims of the relevant ESI activation.     To speed up the award and performance of contracts resulting from procurement procedures, the regulation allows for  certain derogations  to Regulation (EU, Euratom)  2018/1046  , the EU’s Financial Regulation (see  summary  ).   from when does the regulation apply   Regulation (EU) 2016/369 has applied since 16 March 2016.   Amending Regulation (EU) 2020/521 has applied since 1 February 2020.   background   The main reason for the adoption of this regulation in 2016 was the refugee and migration situation affecting the EU. The EU, and especially Greece, was overwhelmed at the time by the arrival of large numbers of refugees and migrants who required urgent humanitarian assistance. The European Commission allocated almost €650 million from 2016 to 2019 to partner organisations to support refugees and migrants in Greece.  For more information, see:    Emergency support within the EU  (  European Commission  )    Crisis management and solidarity  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Humanitarian support:  food, shelter, water, medicine and protection measures are some of the types of humanitarian assistance which can be directed to affected populations.
summary of   Council Directive 2011/64/EU — structure and rates of excise duty applied to manufactured tobacco   what is the aim of the directive  It lays down  general principles  and  minimum rates  of  excise duty  on  manufactured tobacco  (i.e. cigarettes, cigars and cigarillos, fine-cut tobacco for rolling cigarettes and other smoking tobacco) across the EU.   key points    Rules applying to cigarettes    EU countries must apply minimum excise duties to cigarettes whether they are manufactured in the EU or imported. This tax includes:   an   ad valorem    *  excise duty calculated on the maximum retail selling price, including  customs duties  (EU countries may, however exclude customs duties from the calculation of  ad valorem  excise duty on cigarettes) and the  value-added tax  levied on the  weighted average retail selling price   *  ;   a  specific excise duty  calculated per unit of the product.     The  rate  of the  ad valorem  excise duty and the amount of the specific excise duty must be  identical for all cigarettes  .   Since 1 January 2014:   the  specific component  of the excise duty must be between 7.5% and 76.5%.   the  overall excise duty  on cigarettes must constitute at least 60% of the weighted average retail selling price of cigarettes released for consumption. This excise duty must not be less than  €90  per 1 000 cigarettes irrespective of the weighted average retail selling price. EU countries which impose an excise duty of at least  €115  per 1000 cigarettes are not required to comply with the 60% condition. Certain countries (Bulgaria, Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Croatia) were allowed a  transitional period  until  31 December 2017  to adapt to these conditions.     When an EU country increases the rate of VAT on cigarettes, it may reduce the overall excise duty up to an amount which, expressed as a percentage of the weighted average retail selling price, is equal to the increase in the rate of VAT. However, the EU country in question must raise the excise duty again so as to reach at least the original level by 1 January of the second year in which the reduction took place.    Rules applying to manufactured tobacco other than cigarettes    EU countries shall apply an excise duty to manufactured tobacco other than cigarettes, which may be:   an  ad valorem  duty calculated on the basis of the maximum retail selling price of each product;   a specific duty expressed as an amount per kilogram or per 1000 pieces;   a mixture of an  ad valorem  element and a specific element.     The overall excise duty must be at least equivalent to the rates or minimum amounts established for:    cigars or cigarillos  : 5% of the retail selling price or €12 per 1000 items or per kilogram;    fine-cut smoking tobacco intended for the rolling of cigarettes  : 46% of the weighted average retail selling price or € 54 per kilogram; these minimum rates will gradually increase, by 2020, to 50% or €60;    other smoking tobaccos  : 20% of the retail selling price or €22 per kilogram.      Maximum retail selling price   Manufacturers, their representatives or authorised agents in EU countries, and importers of tobacco from non-EU countries have the right to determine the maximum retail selling price for each of their products for each EU country in which the products concerned are to be released for consumption. This does not however affect the implementation of national legislation regarding price control or the observance of imposed prices, provided that they are compatible with EU legislation.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 1 January 2011. Directive 2011/64/EU  codifies  and replaces Directives  92/79/EEC  ,  92/80/EEC  and  95/59/EC  (and their subsequent amendments).   background   For more information, see:    Excise duties: tobacco legislation  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Ad valorem:  a duty that is linked to the value of the product in question.   Weighted average retail selling price:  calculated in accordance with the total value of all cigarettes released for consumption, based on the retail selling price including all taxes, divided by the total quantity of cigarettes released for consumption.
   Smart Grids     Smart Grids     Smart Grids enable consumers to control and manage their own energy use and therefore contribute towards establishing a power system that generates less carbon. The European Commission proposes to use these grids to their full capacity in order to achieve its objectives of reducing primary energy consumption.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 24 April 2011 - Smart Grids: from innovation to deployment [       COM(2011) 202      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This Communication proposes several actions which aim to develop Smart Grids       *      in order to contribute effectively to the European Union’s (EU)       Europe 2020 Strategy      for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.     According to the       European Bio Intelligence study      , the use of these grids could:      reduce the annual primary energy consumption of the EU energy sector by almost 9 % by 2020;       create new jobs;       generate additional economic growth.       1st objective: develop common European Smart Grid standards      Since March 2009, the European Standardisation Organisations (ESOs) such as the       European Committee for Standardization      (CEN), the       European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization      (CENELEC) and the       European Telecommunications Standards Institute      (ETSI) have been responsible for establishing       European standards      for the interoperability of smart utility meters (for electricity, gas, water and heat) and smart grids. The results of this research are expected in 2012 and will be based in part on the       Directive on measuring instruments      .     The ESOs also have the task of developing new standards for the interoperability of chargers for electric vehicles with all types of electric vehicles and with all electricity supply points.     The Commission intends to supervise the development of these standards throughout 2011-12.      2nd objective: guarantee data protection and security      In the EU, the       protection of personal data      is covered by       Directive 95/46/EC      which applies to the processing of data in any sector, including Smart Grids.     The challenge lies in distinguishing between       personal and impersonal data      . The Commission believes that it would be sensible to make adaptations in the national legal frameworks in order to accommodate the specific parameters of Smart Grids, whilst protecting the private life of European citizens.     The Commission proposes to guide the changes to national legislation which will accommodate the parameters of Smart Grids, while the ESOs will be responsible for developing the technical standards for these grids, taking the ‘privacy by design’ approach. An expert group shall assess the network and information security of Smart Grids.      3rd objective: incentivise Smart Grid deployment      The deployment of Smart Grids is       market-driven      . This is the reason why households and companies should have simple access to consumption information so they can keep their energy costs down.     Furthermore, investment in Smart Grids should be incentivised. The       Electricity Directive      and the       Energy Services Directive      should enable the emergence of a regulatory framework which provides incentives for such investment.     The Commission plans to define a methodology using national smart meter implementation plans. In addition, it encourages Member States to design action plans for establishing Smart Grids. Specific coordinated action by all the actors involved will be made possible using national regulators and the       European Network of Transmission System Operators for electricity      (ENTSO-E).      4th objective: develop Smart Grids in a competitive retail market in the interest of consumers      Member States must create       transparent retail markets      and facilitate competition between providers. Developing Smart Grids in a competitive retail market should encourage consumers to change their behaviour in terms of energy consumption, because they should have real-time access to their exact energy consumption.     To complete this market, the Commission plans to revise the Energy Services Directive in order to draw up minimum requirements for the format and content of information provision for customers. It will monitor the implementation of the       Third Energy Package      which, in particular, provides for time-of-use pricing and demand response.      5th objective: support innovation      Smart Grids require significant investment in terms of research and development. For example, the European Electricity Grids Initiative (EEGI) was established under the       Strategic Energy Technology Plan      (SET-Plan) to accelerate the deployment of smart grid technologies by 2020. Two other initiatives have the same objectives: the       Covenant of Mayors      and the       Smart Cities and Communities      initiatives.     The Commission intends to propose new initiatives similar to those mentioned above, with the aim of promoting the deployment of Smart Grids.       Key terms of the Act         Smart Grids: an upgraded electricity network to which two-way digital communication between supplier and consumer, intelligent metering and monitoring systems have been added.

summary of   Regulation (EU) No 557/2014 establishing the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking   what is the aim of the regulation  It establishes the second phase of the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) Joint Undertaking (JU) for the period from 2014 to 2020.  The IMI 2 JU aims to develop new vaccines, medicines and treatments. This is done by means of joint research projects to address Europe’s health challenges and to ensure that Europe’s pharmaceutical industry remains competitive.   key points    Aims    a 30% better success rate in clinical trials of  priority medicines  identified by the World Health Organisation;   clinical proof of concept (i.e. trial) in immunological, respiratory, neurological and neurodegenerative diseases in just 5 years;   diagnostic and treatment markers (i.e. indicators of a pathological or physiological process or disease) for 4 diseases;   at least 2 new medicines (for anti-microbial resistance or Alzheimer’s disease).    Strategic Research Agenda   IMI 2’s focus is on 4 areas of research:    1.    target validation and biomarker  *  research (efficacy and safety);      2.    adoption of innovative clinical trial paradigms;      3.    innovative medicines;      4.    patient-tailored adherence (the extent to which patients take the treatment that they are prescribed, as directed) programmes.      Health priorities  to be addressed by IMI include:   antimicrobial resistance;   osteoarthritis;   cardiovascular diseases;   diabetes;   neurodegenerative diseases;   psychiatric diseases;   respiratory diseases;   immune-mediated diseases (resulting from the activity of the immune system, such as coeliac disease);   ageing-associated diseases;   cancer;   rare/orphan diseases (diseases that affect a small percentage of the population);   vaccines.    Management    The IMI 2 JU is a legal entity set up for the purpose under  Article 187  of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. This article allows for  public-private partnerships at European level  in the field of industrial research.   The JU sets its own strategic research agenda and funds projects selected following calls for proposals published on  IMI 2 JU's  website. As a general rule, the JU applies the  Horizon 2020  rules for participation; the exceptions to this rule are detailed on Regulation (EU) No  622/2014  . However, large European pharmaceutical companies are not eligible for funding.   The JU is managed by an  Executive Director  , who is supported by the staff of the Executive Office. It has a  Governing Board  comprising an equal number of industry and  European Commission  representatives. It has overall responsibility for the operations of the JU and oversees the implementation of its activities.   It is advised by a  Scientific Committee  on scientific priorities. There is also a  States Representatives Group  representing the countries involved, as well as a  Stakeholder Forum  .   Decisions are taken in accordance with the voting rules established by the JU.   Article 209 of the  EU’s Financial Regulation  (Regulation (EU, Euratom) No  966/2012  ) provides for new lighter rules customised for EU PPP bodies.    Budget   The EU’s contribution to IMI 2 is up to €1,638 billion for the period to 2024. This will be matched by €1,425 billion committed by the pharmaceutical industry (in-kind contributions). Additional funding comes from other life science industries or organisations that decide to contribute to IMI 2 as members or  associated partners  in individual projects. The JU also seeks to develop synergies with the  European Structural and Investment Funds  .   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 27 June 2014.   background   For more information, see:    Europe’s partnership for health  (  IMI — Innovative Medicines Initiative  )    History — the IMI story so far  (  IMI — Innovative Medicines Initiative  )    Strategic Research Agenda  (  IMI — Innovative Medicines Initiative  ).   key terms    Biomarkers:  biological indicators used to identify individuals with predispositions to certain diseases.
summary of   Regulation (EU) No 1003/2010 — type-approval requirements for the space for mounting and the fixing of rear registration plates on motor vehicles and their trailers   what is the aim of the regulation   It sets out rules with regard to the space for mounting and the fixing of rear registration plates on motor vehicles and their trailers.   The aim is to adapt current requirements to developments in scientific and technical knowledge.   Regulation (EU)  2015/166  amends the regulation’s Annex II concerning the requirements for the space for mounting and fixing or rear registration plates and related test procedures.   key points   The regulation lays down rules for the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers concerning the space for mounting and the fixing of rear registration plates. It forms part of the implementation of Regulation (EC) No  661/2009  on  type-approval for motor vehicles and trailers  .   Requirements for the space for mounting and the fixing of rear registration plates   The space for a rear registration plate must include a flat or virtually flat rectangular surface which must be either:   520 millimetres wide and 120 millimetres high; or   340 millimetres wide and 240 millimetres high.   Amending Regulation (EU) 2015/166 clarifies the requirements concerning the fixing of a rear registration plate:   the plate must be at right angles (+/- 5°) to the longitudinal plane of the vehicle;   the lower edge of the platemust not be less than 0.30 m from the ground;   the plate must be visible in the whole space;   the specific rules on the plate’s visibility depend on the height of the upper edge of the plate — whether it is more than or not more than 1.20 m from the ground.   The regulation also establishes test procedures to check for compliance.   Rules for EU type-approval   The vehicle manufacturer must submit an application for EU type-approval to the competent authority. This application must include:   the make and type of the vehicle;   the range of dimensions for the space for mounting rear registration plates;   the height of the edges from the road surface.   If the competent authority considers that the vehicle satisfies all of the requirements concerning the space for mounting and the fixing of the rear registration plate, it must grant  EU type-approval  and issue a type-approval number in accordance with Directive 2007/46/EC.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 29 November 2010.   background   For more information, see:    Directives and regulations on motor vehicles, their trailers, systems and components  (  European Commission  ).
summary of   Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 — type-approval of light passenger and commercial vehicles with respect to emissions (Euro 5 and Euro 6) and access to vehicle repair and maintenance information   what is the aim of the regulation  Regulation (EC) No 715/2007:   sets harmonised rules for emission type-approval of  cars and light commercial vehicles, known collectively as light-duty vehicles;   covers replacement, pollution control devices  *  , and sets out rules for their type-approval;   has been amended several times, most recently by Regulation (EU)  2018/858  .   Regulation (EU) 2018/858:   overhauls the EU’s  rules on vehicle type-approval  ;   introduces more robust testing methods with respect to pollutant emissions; and   repeals Directive 2007/46/EC on EU type-approval for vehicles from 31 August 2020.   key points   The legislation applies to light-duty vehicles less than 2.6 tonnes.

   The role of customs in the integrated management of external borders     The role of customs in the integrated management of external borders     With a view to simplifying administrative formalities while enhancing security, the Commission has adopted a communication on rationalising the management of customs controls on the EU's external borders. To do this, it suggests implementing a common approach to goods-linked risks involving all the relevant authorities so as to concentrate controls at border posts with the greatest risks. The communication's objective is to enable customs authorities and other authorities responsible for the management of goods at external borders to control security and safety risks in a coordinated fashion without putting an excessive burden on legitimate trade.     ACT     Communication of 24 April 2003 from the Commission to the Council, European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee on the role of customs in the integrated management of external borders [       COM(2003) 452      final - Official Journal C 96 of 21.4.2004]     SUMMARY     The present customs controls applied to goods are not adequate to protect the Member States from the growing threats to the EU at its external borders. Chief among these are:       Criminal and terrorist threats        This category includes the introduction into the Community of prohibited goods such as explosives or nuclear, biological or chemical weapons, and also smuggling or trafficking of illegal goods such as drugs, cigarettes and counterfeit goods, often used to finance to finance terrorist organisations or organised crime.        Health and safety risks to consumers        This category covers the unauthorised import of contaminated goods, narcotics and anabolic substances, and medicines and consumer products that do not comply with Community safety standards.        Environmental and health risks        These include illegal trafficking of species of fauna and flora in danger of extinction, radioactive matter and risks associated with the undeclared introduction into Community territory of animal or vegetable species or products.      At present the measures, priorities, investment, equipment and resources used to combat these threats and protect the Community and its citizens differ from one Member State to the next. This means that security controls are neither harmonised nor uniform at Community level, and responses to threats at the external borders are sometimes slow. Common, integrated management of the external borders therefore needs to be established.     Customs operations need to be reorganised to increase the safety of goods. Hence the Communication proposes       rationalising customs controls      by identifying which ones could be carried out at internal borders to enable controls at external borders to focus on the goods that absolutely must be checked there for safety reasons.     The Commission proposes establishing a common approach to risk at the external borders. In the end this will mean all the authorities with responsibilities relating to the safety of goods (including customs, the police, consumer protection, health protection and environmental protection authorities) working together to establish priorities and define common risk profiles. The risk profiles can be used to identify the most relevant data for risk analyses.     In the long run this should also mean that traders will be able to electronically transmit all data on their goods to customs for initial identification of risks. The data should be supplied in electronic format to facilitate their transfer, evaluation and processing. Customs will then have to centralise the information and send it to the competent authorities. A single transmission channel will have to be set up for this purpose, and it should be possible to process the information on the basis of the profiles established by all the authorities concerned. Effective and rapid systems for information transmission between customs and the other relevant authorities will have to be set up and operated.     Because of their experience in identifying movements of goods, customs will have to cooperate more closely with the police in fraud investigations and have a more specific role in policing goods.     The material and human resources necessary to implement the approach will need to be available at any point along the external borders. Where bulky or particularly expensive equipment is involved, it may be found desirable to designate certain specialised border posts to control certain well-defined types of goods, and to provide them with the necessary special equipment. This would make it possible to spread equipment costs more equitably and to concentrate expertise at these specialised posts. However, such specialisation should not create an obstacle to legitimate trade by imposing additional costs for processing goods at posts far from their destinations.     The proposal presents initiatives which could be introduced for sharing data on goods moving from one country to another to allow more effective identification of high-risk traffic. This would allow the transfer of data received from the exporting country, where information is easier to locate and fuller, and so accelerate customs procedures without compromising security. The Community should promote this principle of sharing responsibility with its neighbours and main trade partners.     The Community should also step up export controls.     In the interests of risk management on its external borders, the Community should increase its cooperation with third countries and countries with which it shares borders.     Measures to support the new Member States should also be adopted, in particular under the       Customs 2007 programme      .     Last updated: 10.01.2005  
summary of   EU Charter of Fundamental Rights   what is the aim of the charter  It enshrines in European Union (EU) law a range of personal, civil, political, economic and social rights of EU citizens and residents.   key points    Content   The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the Charter) reaffirms, with due regard for the EU’s powers and tasks and for the principle of  subsidiarity  , the rights as they result, in particular, from the constitutional traditions and international obligations common to EU countries, the  European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms  , the Social Charters adopted by the EU and by the  Council of Europe  and the case-law of the  Court of Justice of the European Union  and of the  European Court of Human Rights  . By making fundamental rights clearer and more visible, it creates  legal certainty  within the EU.  The Charter of Fundamental Rights contains a preamble and 54 articles, grouped in 7 chapters:   chapter I:  dignity  (human dignity, the right to life, the right to the integrity of the person, prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, prohibition of slavery and forced labour);   chapter II:  freedoms  (the right to liberty and security, respect for private and family life,  protection of personal data  , the right to marry and found a family, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and information, freedom of assembly and association, freedom of the arts and sciences, the right to education, freedom to choose an occupation and the right to engage in work, freedom to conduct a business, the right to property, the  right to asylum  , protection in the event of removal, expulsion or extradition);   chapter III:  equality  (equality before the law,  non-discrimination  , cultural, religious and linguistic diversity,  equality between men and women  , the  rights of the child  , the rights of the elderly, integration of persons with disabilities);   chapter IV:  solidarity  (  workers’ right to information and consultation within the undertaking  , the right of collective bargaining and action, the right of access to placement services, protection in the event of unjustified dismissal, fair and just working conditions, prohibition of child labour and protection of young people at work, family and professional life, social security and social assistance, health care, access to  services of general economic interest  , environmental protection, consumer protection);   chapter V:  citizens’ rights  (the right to vote and stand as a candidate at elections to the  European Parliament  and at  municipal elections  , the right to good administration, the  right of access to documents  ,  European Ombudsman  , the  right to petition  , freedom of movement and residence,  diplomatic and consular protection  );   chapter VI:  justice  (the right to an effective remedy and a  fair trial  , presumption of innocence and the right of defence, principles of legality and proportionality of criminal offences and penalties, the right not to be tried or punished twice in criminal proceedings for the same criminal offence);   chapter VII:  general provisions  .    Scope   The charter applies to the European institutions, subject to the principle of subsidiarity, and may under no circumstances extend the powers and tasks conferred on them by the  treaties  . The charter also applies to EU countries when they implement EU law.  If any of the rights correspond to rights guaranteed by the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights, the meaning and scope of those rights is to be the same as defined by the convention, though EU law may provide for more extensive protection.   Annual reports   Every year since 2010, the  European Commission  publishes an  annual report  . This monitors progress on the application of the charter.   background    In 1999, the  European Council  concluded that the fundamental rights applicable at EU level should be consolidated in a charter to give them greater visibility.   The charter was formally proclaimed in Nice in December 2000 by the European Parliament, the  Council  and the Commission.   The Charter became legally binding on the EU with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, in December 2009 and now has the same legal value as the EU treaties.   For more information, see:    EU charter of fundamental rights  on the European Commission’s website.
   Iceland - Agriculture, fisheries and food safety     Iceland - Agriculture, fisheries and food safety     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM(2011) 666      final – SEC(2011) 1202 final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The       2011 Commission Report      identifies the progress which still needs to be achieved by Iceland in the fields of agriculture and fisheries. The provisions of the European Union (EU)       acquis      on food safety are applied by the country following the adoption of the       European Economic Area      (EEA) Agreement.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission’s words)      The       agriculture      chapter covers a large number of binding rules, many of which are directly applicable. The proper application of these rules and their effective enforcement by an efficient public administration are essential for the functioning of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The CAP includes the setting-up of management and control systems such as a paying agency and the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS), and also the capacity to implement rural development measures. EU accession requires integration into the common market organisations for a range of agricultural products, including arable crops, sugar, animal products and specialised crops. Member States must also be able to apply EU legislation on direct aid for farmers and to manage the common market organisations for various agricultural products.     The       fisheries       acquis      consists of regulations, which do not need to be transposed into national legislation. However, it requires the introduction of measures to prepare the administration and operators for participation in the Common Fisheries Policy (in the areas of market policy, resource and fleet management, inspection and control, structural actions and State aid). In some cases, existing fisheries agreements or conventions with third countries or international organisations need to be adapted.     This chapter covers detailed rules in the area of       food safety      . The general foodstuffs policy sets hygiene rules for foodstuff production. Furthermore, the       acquis      provides detailed rules in the veterinary field, which are essential for safeguarding animal health, animal welfare and safety of food of animal origin in the internal market. In the phytosanitary field, EU rules cover issues such as quality of seed, plant protection material, harmful organisms and animal nutrition.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      The majority of the       agricultural policy      is still not aligned with the European provisions and no new legislative measures have been undertaken by Iceland. Appropriate administrative structures must also be established in this field.     Overall Iceland has aligned its legislation with the EU       acquis      on matters of       food safety, veterinary policy      and       phytosanitary policy      . However, Iceland’s legislation on live animals is still not aligned and no new development has been noted. The European legislative package relating to hygiene shall be put in place in November 2011. Additional progress is required concerning legislation on phytopharmaceutical products, novel foods, and also to strengthen administrative capacities and the capacities of laboratories.     The country continues to apply a       fisheries policy      , which has similar objectives to those of the European fisheries policy. However, the applicable rules continue to differ considerably. The legislation is not aligned with the EU       acquis      and no new development has been noted. The mechanisms for putting in place and monitoring European support measures must also be established. The existing restrictions to foreign investment in the fisheries sector are not aligned with the European rules.

summary    introduction   The Treaty of Lisbon marks an important step in the role played by national Parliaments in EU affairs, listing, for the first time, in a provision (  Article 12  of the Treaty on European Union – TEU) the various ways in which national Parliaments may ‘contribute actively to the good functioning of the EU’. Their participation is ensured in 4 main ways:        —     receiving information and documents;            —     reviewing respect for the principle of  subsidiarity  ;            —     participating in the evaluation mechanisms in the area of justice, freedom and security;            —     involvement in  Treaty revision  .      information   The following documents must be promptly forwarded to national Parliaments:        —      white papers  ;            —      green papers  ;            —     communications*;            —     the  annual work programme  and any other instrument of legislative planning or policy;            —     proposals for legislation;            —     the agendas and the outcome of meetings of the  Council  ;            —     the annual report of the  European Court of Auditors  ;            —     the annual report established by the  Commission  on the application of the principles governing EU competence;            —     the evaluations of the implementation of the EU policies in the area of freedom, security and justice.      Furthermore, national parliaments receive notification of proposals for the amendment of the Treaties under the ordinary revision procedure and of requests for  accession to the EU  .   review of subsidiarity    The Protocol on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality  allows national Parliaments to issue reasoned opinions if they consider that an EU draft legislative act does not comply with the principle of subsidiarity. All reasoned opinions should be taken into account by the institutions involved in the legislative process. Other consequences for a legislative proposal depend on their number.  The Protocol assigns 2 votes to each national Parliament (if bicameral, one for each chamber). If the reasoned opinions submitted correspond to at least one third of the votes, the Commission has to review its proposal and may decide to maintain, amend or withdraw it. This threshold is lowered to one quarter of the votes in proposals relating to judicial cooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation. When the reasoned opinions submitted correspond to a majority of the votes, if the Commission decides to maintain the proposal, the  European Parliament  and the Council must consider whether the proposal complies with the principle of subsidiarity before concluding the first reading.  The  Court of Justice of the European Union  has jurisdiction in actions, based on a breach of the principle of subsidiarity by a legislative act, brought by Member States, or notified by them in accordance with their legal order on behalf of their national Parliament or a chamber thereof.   specific role in the area of justice, freedom and security   In the  area of justice, freedom and security  , national Parliaments have a specific role. They participate in the evaluation of the activities of  Eurojust  and in the scrutiny of the activities of  Europol  .  In addition, national Parliaments may oppose Council decisions which extend the ordinary legislative procedure (with qualified majority in the Council) to certain aspects of  family law  with  cross-border implications  which are currently subject to a special legislative procedure with unanimity in the Council (   passerelle  clause  in  Article 81  of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union).   involvement in treaty revision   Furthermore, the Treaty of Lisbon associates the national Parliaments with the procedures for the  revision of the treaties  , as described below.        —     Under the ordinary and simplified revision procedures, amendments to the Treaties enter into force after being ratified (or approved, for simplified revision procedures) by all the Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional provisions, which usually require parliamentary ratification.            —     Under the ordinary revision procedure, a Convention, which includes, among other members, representatives of national Parliaments, is convened to examine and adopt a recommendation on the revision proposals.            —     Under the general ‘  passerelle  clause’ of  Article 48(7)  TEU, the initiative taken by the  European Council  to switch from the special legislative procedure to the ordinary legislative procedure, or from voting by unanimity to voting by qualified majority, must be notified to the national Parliaments and cannot be adopted if a national Parliament opposes it within 6 months.      the conference of parliamentary committees for union affairs (cosac)   Since 1989, members of the national Parliaments' committees dealing with EU affairs and members of the European Parliament have met twice a year in a Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs, more commonly known by its French acronym COSAC, to exchange information and best practices and to discuss issues of common European interest.  The role of COSAC is recognised in the protocol on the role of national Parliaments in the EU which states that COSAC may send the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission any contribution it deems appropriate.   key terms    * A communication  is a policy document with no mandatory authority. The Commission takes the initiative of publishing a communication when it wishes to set out its own thinking on a topical issue. A communication has no legal effect (definition from the  European Judicial Network  ).   background   For further information:        —      European Commission page on relations with national Parliaments             —      Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs (COSAC)  – (with links to all 41 chambers)            —      European Parliament's relations with National Parliaments             —      IPEX: The platform for EU Interparliamentary Exchange
   Development of relations between the Commission and civil society     Development of relations between the Commission and civil society     The Commission is keen to improve the consistency and effectiveness of its consultation process, in order to encourage external parties to participate in the development of European policies. This presupposes the definition of general principles and minimum standards with which the Commission must comply. These principles and standards guarantee direct and fair relations with organised civil society.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 11 December 2002, Towards a reinforced culture of consultation and dialogue - General principles and minimum standards for consultation of interested parties by the Commission [       COM(2002) 704      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     By establishing a consultation process, the Commission is encouraging the participation of external interested parties in the development of European policies. Starting the consultation at an early stage in the legislative procedure helps to improve the effectiveness of policies whilst reinforcing the involvement of interested parties and the general public.      External consultation process      The consultation and dialogue are part of the European legislative procedure and complement the work of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union in the development of policy. The scope of the consultation depends on the potential impact of a proposal on a particular sector or on whether it represents a major policy reform.     This process differs clearly from the internal decision-making process and the specific consultation processes provided for in the treaties or secondary legislation, as well as in international agreements.     The process for the consultation of interested external parties is not legally binding. Moreover, it cannot be indefinite or permanent.     The Commission advocates open governance involving as broad a participation by citizens as possible, in a growing number of fields.      The specific role of organised civil society      Civil society organisations act as relays between citizens and the European institutions, thus encouraging policy dialogue and the active participation of citizens in achieving the aims of the European Union (EU).     The departments of the Commission thus conduct structured dialogue with these organisations. Improving the consultation procedures will guarantee a more consistent and interactive approach. Interactive mechanisms will allow the impact of Community policies to be assessed, via the feedback of information and the consultation of panels.     Information on the Commission's formal or structured advisory bodies in which civil society organisations participate can be found in the CONECCS database (       Consultation, European Commission and Civil Society      ), which also includes a voluntary list of civil society organisations established at European level.     The Commission also supports the       Economic and Social Committee      and the       Committee of the Regions      . These institutional advisory bodies acts as relays for the views of organised civil society and regional and local authorities respectively.      A consistent consultation framework      More systematic consultation calls for a rationalisation of procedures and the availability of a structured channel for participants' views to be expressed. Interested parties can express their views via the Internet portal "       Your voice in Europe      ".     The consultation is subject to certain general principles, relating to:      the broadest possible participation of citizens, from the preparation of European policies until their implementation;       the openness and responsibility of each European institution, so that the decision-making process is more visible and more easily understandable for everyone;       the effectiveness of the consultations, which are conducted at a sufficiently early stage so as to have a real influence on the development of policies;       the consistency and flexibility of the consultation procedures, so that they can be adapted to the various categories of interests.      The consultation must respect certain minimum standards, which provide that:      the content of the consultation must be clear. All communication must be sufficiently complete and concise to encourage the interested parties to respond;       the groups consulted must be representative and able to express their views;       the consultation must be publicised as broadly as possible and be geared as far as possible to the target audience;       the timeframe for participation must be long enough for the consulted parties to be able to submit their responses, i.e. at least eight weeks for the receipt of written consultations and 20 working days for meetings;       information provided by the parties consulted must be accompanied by a receipt, and the results of the consultations must be publicised.      These consultation principles and standards apply in particular to key Commission proposals, identified in the Commission's programme of work.     These general principles and minimum standards must be complemented by the dissemination of good practices, such as the diversity, responsibility and integrity of the information gathering exercise.      Background      In this Communication, the Commission is fulfilling the undertakings it made in its 2001 White Paper on       European governance      to reinforce the culture of consultation and dialogue in the European Union.     This Communication also contributes to the 'Action Plan for Better Regulation' and the new approach for evaluating the impact of Community legislation.       Key terms used in the act         Organised civil society: Although there is no legal definition of this concept, the term may be used to designate all organisations associating parties from the labour market, organisations representing various socio-economic groups, non-government organisations, community-based and denominational organisations. These groups are the main structures in society outside the State and the public administration.         Comitology: according to the Treaty establishing the European Community, it is for the Commission to implement legislation at Community level. To do this, it may call on the assistance of a committee comprising representatives of the Member States in order to establish dialogue with the national administrations. The European Parliament also has an important role in the comitology procedure, as it is entitled to express an opinion on the implementation of legislative acts adopted in codecision.       RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission of 5 June 2002, Consultation document: Towards a reinforced culture of consultation and dialogue - Proposal for general principles and minimum standards for consultation of interested parties by the Commission [         COM(2002) 277        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      The Commission launched a consultation to find out the views of all the parties concerned with the improvement of its external consultation process. These results were incorporated in the final version of the Communication from the Commission concerning the drafting of general principles and minimum standards for consultations.      Commission White Paper of 25 July 2001 on European Governance [         COM(2001) 428        final - Official Journal C 287 of 12.10.2001].       Commission Discussion paper of 18 January 2000, The Commission and Non-Governmental Organisations: Building a Stronger Partnership [         COM(2000) 11        final - Not published in the Official Journal]      This Discussion Paper emphasises the Commission's desire to build stronger partnerships with non-government organisations (NGOs). They contribute by their work towards reinforcing participative democracy by improving the representation of certain groups of citizens with the European institutions, as well as with their support for the definition of policies, the management of projects and European integration. Having identified the main issues that hamper such partnerships, the Commission proposes simplifying funding procedures, facilitating access to information and establishing regular dialogue through formalised consultations.

summary of   Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 laying down measures concerning open internet access   what is the aim of the regulation  It aims to introduce rules to safeguard open internet access and abolish retail roaming surcharges for customers while travelling in the EU.   key points   The regulation:   introduces rules to safeguard  equal and non-discriminatory treatment of internet traffic  (net neutrality);   sets up a  new pricing mechanism to regulate mobile roaming services EU-wide  , abolishing surcharges without distorting the market in the home or visited country.   The regulation amends Directive 2002/22/EC on  universal service and users’ rights  relating to electronic communications  networks  and  services  , and Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 on  roaming on public mobile communications networks  within the EU.   Open internet access   Internet providers will be required to treat all traffic equally when providing internet access services:   without discrimination, restriction or interference; and   irrespective of:   the sender and receiver;   the content accessed or distributed; or   the applications or services used.     Providers are allowed to use reasonable  traffic-management measures  , but these must be transparent, non-discriminatory, proportionate and not be based on commercial considerations.   Traffic-management measures  must not monitor  specific content  and must not be in place any longer than necessary. Measures going beyond such reasonable traffic management (for example, blocking or throttling) are prohibited, except for a limited number of cases defined in the regulation.  Agreements on  services requiring a specific level of quality are allowed  , provided they are not a replacement for internet access and do not reduce the availability or quality of the internet access services.  Internet access service providers should  inform customers  about:   how  traffic-management  practices and other services could impact the quality of internet access;   the internet  speed  normally available and the remedies available to users in case of non-compliance.    Roaming charges   A roaming provider must provide roaming services at domestic prices to customers who are normally resident in the EU country of that roaming provider while they are travelling in the EU.  Customers pay domestic prices for phone calls, SMS and mobile internet, irrespective of where they are travelling in the EU. Regulation on  roaming charges  within the EU is amended,  abolishing roaming surcharges  in the EU on 15 June 2017 except as follows:   roaming providers can prevent  abusive or anomalous use  of roaming services at domestic prices by applying a  surcharge  not higher than the maximum wholesale roaming charges, once ‘  fair use  ’ has been exceeded;   in exceptional and specific circumstances, in order to  ensure that domestic pricing is sustainable  , a roaming provider may be allowed by the national regulatory authority to apply a surcharge to recover the cost of providing roaming services to its customers.   As long as a customer travels periodically and spends more time in their home country than abroad in any 4-month period, they can fully benefit from the new rules.  Roaming providers must be transparent about tariffs. In particular, roaming customers must be notified, in a timely manner and free of charge, where the ‘fair use’ policy applies, when voice, SMS or data roaming services have been fully used up. This includes notification of any surcharge as well as roaming data consumption.  The  European Commission  will review the regulation at the latest by December 2019, after consulting  BEREC  .   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 30 April 2016. Roaming charges were abolished from 15 June 2017.   background   For further information, see:    Open Internet: net neutrality  (  European Commission  )    Roaming  (  European Commission  )    Guidelines on the Implementation by National Regulators of European Net Neutrality Rules  (  BEREC  ).
   Rules for the application of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Cohesion Fund (2007-2013)     Rules for the application of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Cohesion Fund (2007-2013)     This Regulation determines the application of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Cohesion Fund. In particular it concerns the obligations of Member States with regard to information and implementing the funds.     ACT     Commission Regulation (EC) No       1828/2006      of 8 December 2006 setting out rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No       1083/2006      laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and of Regulation (EC) No       1080/2006      of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Regional Development Fund [       See amending act(s)      ].     SUMMARY     This Regulation lays down rules for the application of:      Regulation (EC) No         1083/2006        on the European Regional Development (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Cohesion Fund;       Regulation (EC) No         1080/2006        on the ERDF.      This Regulation establishes all the rules for publishing and communicating information relating to projects funded by these Funds. In addition, it defines the rules aimed at ensuring the Funds are properly used, particularly with regard to the monitoring systems put in place by the Member States and the procedures for cases of irregularity.     Lastly, the Regulation establishes the provisions relating to certain specific aspects of the Funds, such as the financial engineering instruments and the eligibility expenditure on housing.      Information and publicity: the communication plan      In accordance with Regulation No       1083/2006      , Member States shall establish operational programmes. These programmes define the development strategies based on funding from the structural Funds.     With transparency in mind, the operational programmes must be the subject of a communication plan. The communication plans are established by the Member States or the management authorities responsible for operational programmes. These plans are aimed at:      beneficiaries and potential beneficiaries in order to widely disseminate information on the possibility of funding and the procedures to follow;       the public, in order to improve the communication of the role played by the European Union (EU) in the financing of programmes which aim to improve economic competitiveness, job creation and internal cohesion.      Furthermore, the communication plans include:      the aims and target groups;       the strategy and content of the information and publicity measures to be taken by the Member State or the managing authority;       the indicative budget for implementation of the plan;       the administrative departments or bodies responsible for implementation of the communication plan;       the means for evaluating the information and publicity measures.      Alongside the dissemination of information, this Regulation defines the responsibilities and roles of each of the stakeholders involved, specifically:      the rules allowing the Member States to submit to the Commission information on the use of the Funds, as well as information on the allocation of the Funds throughout the life of a programme;       the rules enabling the Commission to inform the other Institutions and the citizens of the European Union on the use of the Funds;       the obligations which the managing authorities should have with regard to beneficiaries in the phase leading to the selection and approval of the operations to be funded;       the obligations of the managing authorities with regard to the aspects which the verifications of the expenditure declared by the beneficiary should cover. This includes administrative verifications of the applications for reimbursement, and on-the-spot verifications of individual operations;       the provisions relating to personal data and the exchange of data electronically.      To ensure exchanges of good practice and experience, European networks may be set up, comprising the contact persons responsible for information and publicity, as designated by each managing authority.      Management and control systems      The general provisions on the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund provide that Member States submit to the Commission a description of the management and control systems and a report setting out the results of an assessment of their introduction.     The Commission relies on these documents to satisfy itself that the financial assistance concerned is used by the Member States in accordance with the applicable rules necessary for protecting the EU's financial interests. This is why the present Regulation sets out in detail the information that such documents should contain.     Furthermore, this Regulation lays down specific rules concerning:      intermediate bodies, managing authorities and certifying authorities;       audits of operations;       the description and assessment of management and control systems;       the conditions to be observed when on-the-spot verifications are carried out on a sample basis;       the information which should be included in the accounting records and audit trails.       Irregularities      Member States must report to the Commission any irregularities which have been the subject of a primary administrative or judicial finding. They then inform it of the procedures instituted with respect to all irregularities previously notified and of important changes resulting from them.     Each Member State is to report to the Commission and to the other Member States concerned any irregularities discovered or supposed to have occurred, where it is feared that they may very quickly have repercussions outside its territory or they show that a new malpractice has been employed.      Financial corrections      Where a Member State does not maintain an agreed target level of public structural expenditure during the programming period, no financial correction should be applied if the difference between the agreed target level and the level achieved is equal to or less than 3 % of the agreed target level (de minimis threshold).      Financial engineering instruments      This Regulation lays down general and specific provisions applicable to all financial engineering instruments. Financial engineering instruments take the form of actions which make repayable investments in enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and in public-private partnerships. When the Structural Funds finance operations comprising financial engineering instruments, a business plan must be submitted by the cofinancing partners or shareholders.      Provisions implementing Regulation (EC) No         1080/2006       The present Regulation lays down specific rules concerning the eligibility of expenditure on housing and the eligibility of operational programmes for the European territorial cooperation objective.      Context      The       ERDF      and the       ESF      ("Structural Funds") and the       Cohesion Fund      cofinance projects implemented at regional and local level. The structural funds particularly aim at increasing economic competitiveness, improving employment and strengthening social and economic cohesion between the European regions.

   Erasmus Mundus (2004-08)     Erasmus Mundus (2004-08)     The aim of the Erasmus Mundus programme is to enhance the quality of higher education in Europe by promoting cooperation with third countries and to make higher education in Europe more attractive.     ACT     Decision No       2317/2003/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 December 2003 establishing a programme for the enhancement of quality in higher education and the promotion of intercultural understanding through cooperation with third countries (Erasmus Mundus) (2004 to 2008).     SUMMARY     The Erasmus Mundus programme, which runs from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2008, offers a manifestly "European" content in the field of higher education. First and foremost, it aims to improve the quality and attractiveness of higher education in Europe and to promote international mobility for students and scholars. Erasmus Mundus is a follow-up from the Commission communications on       reinforcing cooperation with third countries      and on       the role of universities in the Europe of knowledge      .      Aims      Erasmus Mundus aims to enhance the quality of European higher education by fostering cooperation with third countries in order to improve the development of human resources and promote dialogue and understanding between peoples and cultures. More specifically, the programme seeks to:      promote quality in higher education with a distinctly European added value;       encourage and enable highly qualified graduates and scholars from all over the world to obtain qualifications and/or acquire experience in the European Union (EU);       develop better-structured cooperation between EU and third-country institutions and increase outgoing mobility from the EU;       make European higher education more accessible and enhance its visibility throughout the world.      In pursuing the programme’s objectives, the Commission must adhere to the Community's general policy on equal opportunities for men and women. It also ensures that no group of citizens or non-EU nationals is excluded or disadvantaged.      Actions      The Erasmus Mundus programme is being implemented through five actions.      Erasmus Mundus masters courses      are advanced-level European diploma courses that are selected by the Commission on the basis of the quality of the training offered. They are characterised by:      cooperation between at least three higher education institutions in three different Member States;       a study programme including a period of study in at least two of the three institutions;       built-in mechanisms for the recognition of periods of study at partner institutions;       the awarding of joint, double or multiple degrees by the participating institutions that are recognised or approved by Member States;       a minimum number of reserved places for non-EU students;       transparent admission conditions that also ensure fairness and equality between men and women;       clear rules for awarding grants to students and scholars;       adequate facilities for non-EU students (information, accommodation, etc.);       the use of at least two European languages that are national languages of the Member States where the participating institutions are situated.      Erasmus Mundus masters courses are selected for a five-year period, with an annual renewal procedure.      Scholarships      provide financial support for non-EU graduate students and scholars attending Erasmus Mundus masters courses. However, students and scholars must meet certain conditions in order to qualify for a scholarship.     Students must be nationals of a third country and hold a first higher education degree. They may not reside in a Member State or in the participating country, and they may not have carried out their main activity in a Member State or participating country for more than 12 months out of the last five years. They must also have been accepted to register or be registered for an Erasmus Mundus masters course.     Scholars must be nationals of a third country and may not reside in a Member State or participating country. They may not have carried out their main activity in a Member State or participating country for more than a total of 12 months out of the last five years. They must also offer outstanding academic and/or professional experience.      Partnerships with non-EU higher education institutions      (maximum duration of three years) involve an Erasmus Mundus masters course and a higher education institution in at least one non-EU country, in order to create a framework for mobility towards the third country. Recognition of study periods at the host (non-EU) institution must be guaranteed.     Students and scholars from Member States and third-country nationals who have been legally resident in the EU for at least three years before the start of the mobility programme (for purposes other than study) are eligible for mobility grants.     Partnership projects may also include:      teaching assignments at a partner institution with a view to developing the project curriculum;       exchanges of teachers, trainers, administrators and other relevant specialists;       development and dissemination of new methods for use in higher education, including information and communication technologies, e-learning, and open and distance learning;       developing cooperation schemes with third-country higher education institutions with a view to offering courses there.      Erasmus Mundus supports activities and measures       to make higher education in Europe more attractive      as a venue for study, for example by enhancing the profile and visibility of, and accessibility to, European education. The measures may also aim at achieving the objectives of the Erasmus Mundus programme, such as the international dimension of quality assurance, mobility, credit recognition, recognition of European qualifications abroad and mutual recognition of qualifications with third countries. They may also consist of establishing links between higher education and research.     Activities must take place within networks involving at least three public or private organisations (in three different Member States) that are active in higher education at national or international level. Networks may also involve third-country organisations. These activities (such as seminars, conferences, workshops, ICT tools or publications) may take place in Member States or third countries.      Technical support measures      during the implementation of the programme may involve experts, executive or other competent agencies in Member States on the Commission’s initiative, or any other form of technical assistance.      Beneficiaries      Erasmus Mundus is aimed in particular at:      higher education institutions;       students holding a first degree from a higher education institution;       scholars or researchers;       staff directly involved in higher education;       other public or private bodies active in the field of higher education.       Participating countries      The programme is open to the EU Member States, the European Free Trade Association countries that are part of the European Economic Area (EEA-EFTA) and candidate countries for accession to the EU.      Implementation of the programme      The Commission is responsible for the practical implementation of the programme. A selection board, composed of eminent personalities from the academic world who are representative of the diversity of higher education in the EU, selects the Erasmus Mundus masters courses and partnerships of higher education institutions. Erasmus Mundus masters courses are allocated a specific number of grants. The institutions offering Erasmus Mundus masters courses are responsible for selecting students from third countries, while the Commission selects promotional activities.     Selection procedures include a clearing mechanism at European level in order to prevent serious imbalances across fields of study, students' and scholars' nationalities and Member States of destination.     In cooperation with Member States, the Commission ensures overall consistency and complementarity with other relevant Community policies, instruments and actions, in particular with the framework research programmes and external cooperation programmes in the field of higher education.     Member States must ensure the efficient management of the programme at national level (including the designation of appropriate structures to cooperate closely with the Commission), involving all parties concerned. They must endeavour to remove legal and administrative barriers.      Budget      The financial framework for the 2004-08 period was initially set at EUR 230 million, but was boosted by allocations from the 'external aid’ budget and now stands at EUR 296.1 million. The annual appropriations are approved by the budgetary authority within the limits of the financial perspectives.      Monitoring and evaluation      The Commission regularly monitors the programme in cooperation with Member States. It also constantly evaluates the programme’s overall impact and the complementarity between the programme and other relevant Community policies, instruments and actions.     The Commission must submit the following to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions:      a report on the financial repercussions of an accession of a new Member State on the programme and proposals to counteract them;       an interim evaluation report by 30 June 2007 on the results achieved and on the qualitative aspects of programme implementation;       a communication on the continuation of the programme by 31 December 2007;       an ex-post evaluation report by 31 December 2009.       Background      The Erasmus Mundus programme responds to the challenges of the       Bologna process      initiated in 1999 and the       Lisbon strategy      launched in 2000, which respectively ensure that the European higher education system acquires a worldwide degree of attractiveness appropriate to Europe’s cultural and scientific traditions and adapt European education and training systems to the needs of the knowledge society.      References            Act                 Entry into force - Date of expiry                 Deadline for transposition in the Member States                 Official Journal                Decision                 2317/2003/EC                20.1.2004 – 31.12.2008               -               OJ L 345 of 31.12.2003          RELATED ACTS      Decision No         1298/2008/EC        of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 establishing the         Erasmus Mundus 2009-2013        action programme for the enhancement of quality in higher education and the promotion of intercultural understanding through cooperation with third countries [Official Journal L 340 of 19.12.2008].      The Erasmus Mundus 2009-13 action programme is based on its predecessor for the period 2004-08. This new programme is consistent with the objectives of excellence of the previous one, but introduces certain adaptations to the scope. Among others, the programme is now extended to the doctoral level, it more effectively integrates third country higher education institutions and their needs and provides more funding to European participants. Furthermore, instead of the previous five actions, the programme is now implemented through joint programmes, partnerships and measures promoting European higher education.      EVALUATION       Report from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 2 July 2007 – Report on the Interim Evaluation of the Erasmus Mundus Programme 2004-2008 [         COM(2007) 375        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      During the period of 2004-06, the Erasmus Mundus programme led to the creation of 80 Erasmus Mundus masters courses, 2325 scholarships for non-EU students, 19 partnerships and 23 projects designed to make European higher education more attractive. The Commission presents its conclusions and recommendations on the implementation of the programme based on the external evaluation undertaken during the period 2004-06. The programme’s added value, relevance, utility, efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability have been assessed. It responds to the objectives of the Bologna process and the Lisbon strategy in terms of mobility, cooperation, excellence and intercultural understanding. It thus allows European higher education to compete at world level. The programme has also led to better-structured cooperation. Furthermore, it has encouraged certain Member States to establish a legal framework for the accreditation of joint, double or multiple degrees in connection with partnerships. However, additional funding from the ‘external aid’ budget proved necessary in order to contend with the increase in demand for masters courses and scholarships. Non-EU students also benefited more from the programme than EU students.     With a view to preparing the next programme, recommendations have been drafted in order to improve, strengthen and extend the programme. These recommendations relate to the design of the programme, including the extension of scholarships to EU students, extension of the programme to doctorates, encouraging cooperation and partnerships with third-country higher education establishments, and so on. Recommendations on programme management refer in particular to scholarships, the reinforced role of national information sources, the promotion, dissemination and follow-up of projects, as well as the preparation of guidelines on good practice in order to ensure the quality of masters courses. Concerning programme funding, Erasmus Mundus scholarships and tuition fees for masters courses will be maintained at a level that is competitive internationally. The Commission plans to increase the financing allocated to universities that are members of an Erasmus Mundus Master Consortium in order to reflect the true cost of programmes.

   Distance contracts     Distance contracts     European consumers benefit from an increased level of protection when they buy a product or service at a distance. They benefit from a series of contractual rights and rules harmonised at the European level.     ACT     Directive       97/7/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 1997 on the protection of consumers in respect of distance contracts [       See amending act(s)      ].     SUMMARY     The Directive applies to       distance contracts      between a professional and a consumer, for the provision of a service or goods. A distance contract may be concluded by any means (by telephone, e-mail, catalogue, etc.) which do not require the simultaneous physical presence of the parties to the contract.     However, the Directive does not apply to contracts:      relating to         financial services        ;       concluded by means of automatic vending machines or automated commercial premises;       concluded with telecommunications operators through the use of public telephones;       relating to immobile property, except for rental;       concluded at an auction.      In addition, professionals may receive partial exemption (concerning the information requirements, the right of withdrawal and the performance of the contract) for contracts relating to:      food, beverages, goods intended for current consumption in the household supplied by regular roundsmen;       and contracts for the provision of accommodation, catering, leisure or transport services where the supplier undertakes to provide these services on a specific date or within a specific period.       Information for consumers      The professional must provide clear and comprehensible information to the consumer, in good time prior to the conclusion of the contract. They must give due regard to the principles of good faith in commercial transactions and the protection of persons who are unable to give their consent (such as minors).      Pre-contractual information      includes, as a minimum:      the identity and possibly the address of the supplier;       the characteristics of the goods or services and their price including all taxes;       delivery costs;       the arrangements for payment, delivery or performance of the contract;       the existence of a right of withdrawal;       the period for which the offer or the price remains valid and possibly the minimum duration of the contract;       the cost of using the means of distance communication, where it is calculated other than at the base rate.      In the case of telephone calls, the trader must identify themselves and their commercial purpose at the beginning of the call.     The professional must provide       written confirmation of the pre-contractual information      (or on another durable medium, such as electronic mail) at the time of performance of the contract or at the latest during delivery of the goods if they are being sent directly to the consumer.     However, written confirmation is not required if the performance of the contract is realised through the use of a means of distance communication, where the services are supplied on only one occasion and are invoiced by the operator using the means of distance communication.     The consumer also receives       written confirmation      regarding:      the conditions for exercising the right of withdrawal;       the place to which the consumer may address complaints;       information relating to after-sales service and guarantees;       conditions under which the contract may be rescinded, where it is of an unspecified duration or a duration exceeding one year.       Consumers’ right of withdrawal      The consumer may make a decision within a period of       seven working days      , without penalty and without giving a reason. The only charge that may be made to the consumer is the direct cost of returning the goods.     The start of the withdrawal period varies. If the professional has met their obligations of providing information in writing to the consumer, it is calculated from:      the day of receipt of the goods by the consumer;       from the day of conclusion of the contract or from the day on which the information obligations were fulfilled, provided that this period does not exceed three months.      If the supplier has not met their obligations to provide information in writing, exercising the right of withdrawal is extended for a       period of three months      , calculated from:      the day of receipt of the goods by the consumer;       the day of the conclusion of the contract for the service.      Where the right of withdrawal has been exercised by the consumer, the supplier shall reimburse the sums as soon as possible and within a maximum of thirty days.     However, the consumer may not exercise their right to withdrawal for all types of contracts, except if a specific conventional clause is provided by the parties. Withdrawal is usually impossible for the following types of contracts:      for the provision of services if performance has begun before the end of the seven working day period;       for the supply of goods or services the price of which is dependent on fluctuations in the financial market;       for the supply of goods made to the consumer's specifications or which cannot be returned (liable to deteriorate or expire rapidly);       for the supply of audio or video recordings or computer software which were unsealed by the consumer;       for the supply of newspapers;       for gaming and lottery services.      If the consumer has contracted credit for the goods or service, the credit shall be cancelled following the withdrawal without penalty.      Performance of the contract      In principle, the supplier has thirty days in which to perform the contract. If the goods or service ordered are not available, the consumer shall be reimbursed within 30 days. However, if the contract provides for this possibility, the supplier may procure goods or services of an equivalent quality and price to the original order.      Unsolicited supply of goods      The supply of unsolicited goods is prohibited. This supply is considered to be an       unfair trading practice      , even if the consumer has not indicated their refusal.      Communication techniques      If the supplier uses an automated calling system without human intervention (automatic calling machine) or a facsimile machine (fax), they must request the prior consent of the consumer.     However, they may use other distance communication techniques, except if there is clear objection from the consumer.

   A strategy for better ship dismantling practices     A strategy for better ship dismantling practices     The Commission has adopted a Community strategy aimed at making practices for the dismantling of old ships safer for workers and for the environment. Although the European Union has transposed the       Basel Convention      on movements of hazardous waste as well as its amendment concerning the ban on exporting this type of waste to countries which do not belong to the OECD into Community law, the situation is not satisfactory.     Many decommissioned European ships end up on the beaches of South Asia where they are dismantled. The absence of environmental protection and safety measures results in a high rate of accidents, health risks and large-scale pollution affecting vast expanses of the coast. The strategy proposed to improve ship dismantling practices includes action aimed at contributing to the implemention of the main elements of an international convention on the recycling of ships which has just been adopted. It also provides for measures aimed at encouraging voluntary action by the maritime transport sector and better application of current Community legislation on waste shipments.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 19 November 2008 - An EU strategy for better ship dismantling [       COM(2008) 767      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The European Union (EU) strategy gives effect to the       2007 Green Paper      on better ship dismantling practices. This strategy should guarantee that ships with a strong link to the Union (in terms of flag or ownership) are dismantled only in safe and environmentally sound facilities, in line with the Hong Kong Convention developed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and adopted on 19 May 2009.     Such a strategy complies with       Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006      on waste shipments which transposes the Basel Convention. It thus aims to prevent the export of hazardous end-of-life ships from the EU to developing countries, and to protect human health and the environment during dismantling operations, without creating unnecessary new economic burdens.      Main elements of the strategy proposed by the Commission      The EU strategy proposes a series of measures aimed at improving ship dismantling conditions as soon as possible, in particular during the interim period preceding the entry into force of the new IMO convention. The following measures are envisaged in particular:      start preparations to introduce measures on key elements of the new IMO convention, in particular concerning surveys, certification and the inventory of hazardous materials present on board ships;       encourage voluntary industry action through various measures, such as awards for exemplary “green” recycling activities, the publication of guidelines and a list of “clean” dismantling facilities.       provide technical assistance and support to developing countries for training programmes in safety and the establishment of basic infrastructure for environmental and health protection;       improve the application of current rules on waste shipments by intensifying controls in European ports, enhancing cooperation and exchange of information between European authorities and the establishment of a list of ships ready for scrapping.      The strategy also proposes that the Commission should examine the feasibility of the following measures:      establish auditing and certification of ship recycling facilities worldwide and evaluate how EU ships might be encouraged to use this scheme;       ensure that warships and other government vessels which do not come under the scope of the convention be subject to Community rules for their “clean” dismantling;       establish a mandatory international funding system for “clean” ship dismantling.       Context      The preparation of an EU strategy for environmentally sound ship dismantling practices is one of the elements of the Commission action plan on an integrated maritime policy for the European Union.     This Communication has the aim of encouraging debate and paving the way for the legislative proposal to be presented after the adoption of the Hong Kong Convention in May 2009.

act   Council Regulation (EEC) No  3577/92  of 7 December 1992 applying the principle of freedom to provide services to maritime transport within Member States (maritime cabotage).   summary    Scope   This law ensures that, within a given EU country, shipping companies or nationals based in other EU countries have the right to offer maritime transport services (known as maritime cabotage) provided they comply with all the conditions for carrying out cabotage within that country. Shipping companies based in countries outside the EU, but controlled by EU nationals, may also offer such services.  The regulation defines ‘maritime transport services within an EU country (maritime cabotage)’, ‘Community shipowners’, ‘public service contract’, ‘public service obligations’, and ‘serious disturbance of the internal transport market’.   Manning   Depending on the kind of transport service, matters relating to manning are the responsibility either of the EU country of registration (flag State) or of the country in which the cabotage service is performed (host State).   Public service   EU countries may make the right to provide transport services subject to public service obligations or may conclude public service contracts in the interests of maintaining adequate cabotage services between the mainland and its islands and between the islands themselves.   Safeguard measures   Where the market's opening up to cabotage results in problems (such as the serious excess of supply over demand) that threaten the financial survival of shipping companies, the Commission may introduce safeguard measures. These may include the temporary exclusion of the area concerned from the scope of the regulation.   Non-discrimination   Persons providing maritime transport services in an EU country other than their own may do so temporarily on the same terms as those applied by that country to its own nationals.   Timetable   Maritime cabotage was liberalised on 1 January 1993. For France, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Spain, mainland cabotage was gradually liberalised according to a specific timetable for each type of transport service. Mainland-island and inter-island cabotage for these countries was liberalised in 1999. This exemption was extended for Greece until 2004 for scheduled passenger and lighter services and services involving vessels of less than 650 gross tonnes (gt). Exemptions were granted to Croatia till 31 December 2016 for existing public service contracts and for cruise services between Croatian ports by ships smaller than 650 gt, which are reserved for Croatian ships till 31 December 2014.

   Radio and telecommunications terminal equipment     Radio and telecommunications terminal equipment     This Directive establishes the regulatory framework for the placing on the market, free movement and putting into service in the European Union (EU) of radio equipment and telecommunications terminal equipment. The aim of this Directive is to create an open and competitive single market. It also aims to ensure a high level of health and safety protection, and to avoid harmful interference.     ACT     Directive       1999/5/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 1999 on radio equipment and telecommunications terminal equipment and the mutual recognition of their conformity [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     This Directive is intended to encourage rapid dissemination of innovative technology and thus promote competition in the internal market for telecommunications.      Scope      The Directive applies to radio equipment       *      and telecommunications terminal equipment       *      . The Directive also applies where this equipment :      incorporates, as an integral part or as an accessory, a medical device within the meaning of Directive         93/42/EEC        on         medical devices        ;       incorporates, as an integral part or as an accessory, an active implantable medical device within the meaning of Directive         90/385/EEC        on         active implantable medical devices        ;       constitutes a component or a separate technical unit of a vehicle, within the meaning of Directive         72/245/EEC        relating to radio interference caused by motor vehicles;       constitutes a component or a separate technical unit of a vehicle, within the meaning of Directive         2002/24/EC        relating to the type-approval of         two- or three-wheel motor vehicles        .      The Directive does not apply to apparatus exclusively used for activities concerning public security, defence, State security and the activities of the State in the area of criminal law; nor does it apply to:      radio equipment used by radio amateurs, except when it is commercially available fully assembled;       equipment covered by Directive         96/98/EC        relating to marine equipment;       wires and cables;       radio equipment intended to be used solely for the reception of sound and TV broadcasting services;       products, equipment or components within the meaning of Council Regulation (EEC) No         3922/91        relating to the field of         civil aviation        ;       Essential requirements and harmonised European standards      Member States must ensure that apparatus complies with the essential requirements of the Directive where it is properly installed, maintained and used, which is a condition for its being placed on the market.     The following essential requirements are applicable to the apparatus:      protection of the health and safety of the user and any other person, including the security provisions laid down in Directive         2006/95/EC        , relating to electrical equipment designed for use within certain         voltage limits        (but with no lower voltage limit);        electromagnetic compatibility        as per Directive         2004/108/EC        ;       use of the spectrum allocated to terrestrial/space radiocommunication and to orbital resources, which make it possible to avoid harmful interference.      When an apparatus is in       conformity with harmonised European standards      , in accordance with the       procedures      established by Directive       98/34/EC      , the Member States presume that the current Directive’s requirements have been met.      Information and notification      Member States shall ensure that the manufacturers or the persons responsible for placing the apparatus on the market provide information on its use in the documentation or packaging, together with the declaration of conformity with the essential requirements.     More specifically, for radio equipment, this information must be sufficient to identify on the packaging and in the instructions for use of the apparatus the Member States or the geographical area within a Member State where the equipment is intended to be used.     For telecommunications terminal equipment, such information must identify the interfaces of the public telecommunications networks to which the equipment is intended to be connected.      CE marking      Apparatus which complies with all the essential requirements bears the       CE conformity marking      . Manufacturers identify their apparatus by stating its type, batch and/or serial numbers and by the name of the manufacturer or of the person responsible for placing the apparatus on the market.     If a notified body has been consulted by the manufacturer regarding the equipment's conformity with the Directive, its number accompanies the CE marking.     In its Decision       2000/299/EC      of 6 April 2000, the Commission established a class of radio equipment and telecommunications terminal equipment that cannot be used everywhere in the EU (as in the case of non-harmonised national frequency plans). This type of equipment must bear a corresponding warning mark along side the CE marking.      Placing on the market and free movement      Member States must not prohibit, restrict or impede the placing on the market and putting into service on their territory of any apparatus if it complies with the essential requirements and other provisions of the Directive.     If a Member State decides that apparatus does not meet the requirements of this Directive, it may prohibit, interrupt or restrict the placing on the market and also the putting into service of that apparatus.      Putting into service and the safeguard clause      Member States may restrict the putting into service of radio equipment only for reasons relating to the efficient and appropriate use of the radio spectrum, the need to avoid harmful interference, or public health issues.     If a Member State decides that an apparatus does not satisfy the requirements of the safeguard clause, it may take measures to withdraw it from service, to prohibit its being in service or to restrict its free movement.      Conformity assessment and notified bodies      This Directive lays down the procedures from which the manufacturer may choose for assessing conformity with the essential requirements for different types of equipment. Member States notify the Commission of the bodies they have designated to carry out the conformity assessment procedures.     If the manufacturer so chooses, the procedures for assessing conformity with essential requirements in Directive       73/23/EEC      and Directive       89/336/EEC      may also be used for assessing conformity with the respective requirements of those directives.       Key terms used in the act         Radio equipment: a product, or component thereof, capable of communication by means of the emission and/or reception of radio waves utilising the spectrum allocated to terrestrial/space radio communication.         Telecommunications terminal equipment: a product, or a component of a product, which is intended to be connected directly or indirectly to interfaces of public telecommunications networks.         Apparatus: any radio equipment, telecommunications terminal equipment, or both.

summary of   Article 8 of the 1957 Euratom Treaty   what is the aim of this treaty article  The Joint Research Centre (JRC), set up under Article 8 of the 1957 Euratom Treaty, is the science and knowledge service of the  European Commission  providing independent scientific advice and support to EU policy.  Originally established with a view to carrying out nuclear research, it was entrusted with other activities over the years.   key points   A 1989 Council  decision  and some 1994 Council  conclusions  supplement Article 8 in clarifying the role and funding of the JRC in the  non-nuclear field  . The conclusions in particular reinforce the JRC’s move towards non-nuclear activities and a benchmarking (evaluating something by comparison with a standard) and competitive approach.  JRC scientific work supports a variety of EU policies with  independent scientific evidence  . These policies include:    agriculture and food security  ;    economic and monetary union  ;    energy and transport  ;    environment and climate change  ;    health and consumer protection  ;    safety and security  ;    information society  ;    innovation and growth  ;    nuclear safety and security  ;    standards  .    Creating and managing knowledge   As the Commission’s knowledge and science service, the JRC plays a central role in  creating, managing and making sense  of collective  scientific knowledge  for better EU policies.   JRC role   Under the regulation setting up  Horizon 2020  , the framework programme for research and innovation for the 2014-2020 period, the JRCs role is to:   contribute to the nuclear safety research needed for safe, secure and peaceful use of nuclear energy, and other non-fission applications  *  ;   provide a scientific basis for the relevant EU policies and, where necessary, react within the limits of its mission and competence to nuclear events, incidents and accidents;   carry out research and provide independent and customer-driven scientific advice to EU and national policymakers in non-nuclear policy areas, while flexibly responding to new policy demands;   actively support the functioning of the  European Research Area  by:   close collaboration with peers and actors involved,   maximising access to JRC facilities;   training researchers;   close cooperation with EU countries and international institutions that pursue similar objectives.      Budget   The JRC is funded by the research framework programmes (nuclear and non-nuclear activities); in addition, it generates a part of its budget through activities of a competitive nature.   Reorganisation   Over the years since it was set up, the JRC’s scope and structure has evolved. The 1996 Commission  Decision 96/282/Euratom  reorganised the JRC, whereby its Director-General is assisted by a Board of Governors nominated by EU countries and appointed by the Commission. The board assists the Director-General in preparing work programmes.   background   For more information, see also:    Horizon 2020 and the Joint Research Centre (JRC)  (  European Commission  )    The Joint Research Centre: EU policy-making based on facts  (  European Commission  )    Joint Research Centre (JRC): EU Science Hub  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Non-fission applications:  applications which do not involve nuclear fission activities (nuclear fission is where an atom is split and releases energy).
   Reinsurance (until November 2012)     Reinsurance (until November 2012)     This Directive provides a regulatory framework for reinsurance activities       *      in the EU. The supervision of reinsurers is to be provided by the competent authorities of their “home Member State”, on the basis of which they could operate throughout the EU.     ACT     Directive       2005/68/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 November 2005 on reinsurance and amending Council Directives 73/239/EEC, 92/49/EEC as well as Directives 98/78/EC and 2002/83/EC [       See amending act(s)      ].     SUMMARY     This Directive, provided for in the       Action Plan for Financial Services      (APFS), provides a harmonised regulatory framework for reinsurance in the European Union (EU). By establishing a system of specific supervision for the cross-border reinsurance market, the Directive aims to strengthen insurance markets. According to the Commission, the Directive will help to reduce the administrative charges and costs resulting from different national rules.     This Directive follows the approach adopted by European legislation on insurance by bringing about such harmonisation as is essential, necessary and sufficient to achieve the mutual recognition of authorisations and prudential supervision systems, thereby making it possible to grant a single authorisation valid throughout the EU and to apply the principle of supervision by the home Member State.      Scope      This Directive provides general provisions for the taking up of the self-employed activity of reinsurance carried out exclusively by undertakings, which are established in a Member State or wish to become established there.     This Directive will not apply to:      direct insurance undertakings to which Directives         73/239/EEC        or         2002/83/EC        apply (Life assurance and non-life insurance);       activities and bodies referred to in Articles 2 and 3 of Directive 73/239/EEC;       activities and bodies referred to in Article 3 of Directive 2002/83/EC;       the activity of reinsurance conducted or fully guaranteed by the government of a Member State acting, for reasons of substantial public interest, as a last resort reinsurer, including when such a role is required by a situation whereby adequate reinsurance cover cannot be provided on the commercial market.       Taking up the business of reinsurance      The taking up of the business of reinsurance is to be subject to prior administrative authorisation granted by the competent authorities of the home Member State. Such authorisation, valid throughout the EU, will permit a reinsurance undertaking to operate, under either the right of establishment or the freedom to provide services.     Authorisation is provided for all types of reinsurance business (life assurance, non-life insurance, etc.) and granted to any reinsurance undertaking adopting one of the forms set out in Annex 1 to the Directive or, alternatively, that of European Company (SE).     All reinsurance undertakings must:      limit their activities to reinsurance and related business;       submit a scheme of operations;       possess the minimum guarantee fund (set at €3 million), subject to certain exceptions;       be run by “qualified” persons “of good repute”. The identities of the shareholders or members must also be made known.       Conditions for conducting reinsurance business      As regards the principles and methods of financial supervision, this Directive stresses that the financial supervision of reinsurance undertakings is the sole responsibility of the home Member State and involves the verification of solvency (in other words, the undertaking's ability to fund expenses), technical provisions (the amount which a reinsurance undertaking must provide for in order to meet its underwriting liabilities) and the assets of reinsurance undertakings. Particular attention is given to professional confidentiality obligations and to the exchange of information between competent authorities.      Conditions relating to acquisitions and qualified shares      The Directive lays down specific criteria for implementing the prudential evaluation of shareholders and management at the time of a planned acquisition, defining a clear procedure for this to be implemented. The competent authorities must be given prior notice of all acquisitions or transfers of qualified shares in reinsurance undertakings, before conducting an agreed evaluation.     The competent authorities will decide on the appropriate repute of the potential purchaser, its potential influence and financial health of the acquisition.      Rules relating to technical provisions      The Directive provides for:      the         establishment of technical provisions        by reinsurance undertakings in accordance with Directives         91/674/EEC        or 2002/83/EC. Authorised reinsurance undertakings do not need to pledge assets to cover reserves. The State may allow technical provisions to be covered by claims against reinsurers or insurers who are not authorised;       the establishment of         equalisation reserves        in order to offset deficits recorded in each financial year under five heads of credit: general insolvency, export credit, instalment credit, mortgages and agricultural credit. In certain cases, the Member State may grant an exemption from the obligation to establish an equalisation reserve;       freedom to invest         assets covering the technical provisions        and equalisation reserves, provided it is diversified and prudent. The aim is to reduce the risk of volatility in the financial markets and to secure the sufficiency, liquidity, security and matching of investments;       notification by the acquirer in writing of the intended amount of his participation to the relevant authorities.       Solvency margin and guarantee fund      Each Member State is to require of every reinsurance undertaking whose head office is situated in its territory an adequate available solvency margin in respect of its entire business at all times, which is at least equal to the requirements of this Directive.     The Directive provides that the required solvency margin in respect of both non-life and life reinsurance business should be determined on the basis either of the annual amount of premiums or contributions, or of the average burden of claims for the past three financial years.     Reinsurance undertakings transacting both non-life and life reinsurance business must have an available solvency margin to cover the total sum of required solvency margins in respect of both non-life and life reinsurance activities; otherwise, an undertaking will be deemed to be in difficulty or in an irregular situation.     The guarantee fund corresponds to a third of the required solvency margin. It may not be less than €3 million, while any Member State may provide that, for captive reinsurance undertakings       *      , the minimum guarantee fund be not less than €1 million.      Reinsurance undertakings in difficulty      The competent authorities in the home Member State may restrict or prohibit the free disposal of assets belonging to reinsurance undertakings in difficulty or in an irregular situation. The competent authorities must be empowered to require reinsurance undertakings to have a financial recovery plan of reinsurance undertakings (which must contain an estimate of management costs, forecast revenue and expenditure, a forecast balance sheet, estimates of the financial resources intended to cover underwriting liabilities and the requisite solvency margin and the overall retrocession policy). In exceptional cases, the authorisation granted to a reinsurance undertaking may be withdrawn by the home Member State.      Other provisions      In certain cases, the home Member State may lay down specific provisions concerning the pursuit of “finite” reinsurance activities       *      . As regards special purpose vehicles       *      , the Member State where the vehicle is established is to lay down the conditions under which the activities of such an undertaking is to be carried out.     Where a reinsurance undertaking with a branch or carrying on business under the freedom to provide services does not comply with the law of the host Member State, the local authorities may first call upon the undertaking to remedy that irregular situation; if the infringement continues, they may intervene in order to prevent or penalise the new irregular situation.     Reinsurance undertakings whose head offices are outside the European Union (EU) are not to be more favourably treated than reinsurance undertakings that have their head office in the EU.     Where a third country fails to grant EU reinsurance undertakings effective access to its market, the EU may negotiate with a view to obtaining improved access to that third-country market. In comitology, the Commission is to be assisted by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Committee.     This Directive is repealed by the       Directive on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of insurance and reinsurance      as of 1 November 2012.       Key terms used in the act         Reinsurance: the activity consisting of accepting risks ceded by an insurance undertaking or by another reinsurance undertaking.         Captive reinsurance undertaking: a reinsurance undertaking owned either by a financial undertaking other than an insurance or a reinsurance undertaking or a group of insurance or reinsurance undertakings to which           Directive 98/78/EC          “Finite” reinsurance: reinsurance under which the maximum loss potential exceeds the premium over the lifetime of the contract by a limited but significant amount, together with at least one of the following two features: i) explicit and material consideration of the time value of money; ii) contractual provisions to moderate the balance of economic experience between the parties over time to achieve the target risk transfer.         Special purpose vehicles: any undertaking which assumes risks from insurance or reinsurance undertakings and which covers such risks through the proceeds of a debt issuance or some other financing mechanism.

   Action plan for entrepreneurship     Action plan for entrepreneurship     A Community action plan is proposing a series of measures to promote entrepreneurship in order to help entrepreneurs fully realise their ambitions and provide them with a business climate conducive to entrepreneurship. For, although 47% of Europeans express a preference for self-employment, only 17% actually realise their ambitions.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 11 February 2004 entitled "Action Plan: The European agenda for Entrepreneurship" [       COM(2004) 70      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Taking account of the reactions provoked by the publication of the       Green Paper on Entrepreneurship      , this action plan proposes a set of measures to promote entrepreneurship in order to help entrepreneurs fully realise their ambitions and provide them with a business climate conducive to entrepreneurship.     The Action Plan sets out the key objectives to be achieved by the European Union (EU) and Member States' policy-makers in the following five strategic areas:      Fuelling entrepreneurial mindsets      In order to inform as many people as possible about entrepreneurship, the Commission intends to foster entrepreneurial mindsets among young people through educational activities (such as presenting role models) in schools. The Commission calls upon the Member States to integrate entrepreneurship education into all schools' curricula, arrange awareness campaigns, offer training material, organise training modules for teachers and, together with business organisations, involve entrepreneurs in teaching programmes.      Encouraging more people to become entrepreneurs      According to the Eurobarometer, although 47% of Europeans say they prefer self-employment, only 17% actually realise their ambitions. Encouraging more people to become entrepreneurs means:       Reducing the stigma of failure        . A better understanding of business failure, including distinguishing between honest and dishonest bankruptcies, is needed in order to tackle the stigma of failure. The Commission will gather practical information on early warning signs of financial difficulties, reasons for failure, barriers to starting afresh and portraits of failed and restarted entrepreneurs. This information should be used in promotional campaigns or teaching courses and should help reduce the stigma suffered by failed entrepreneurs. The Commission is planning to prepare, together with an expert group, self-evaluation tests for entrepreneurs to assess their financial condition, including information on existing support and procedures aimed at rescue from failure;        Facilitating business transfers        . Given that it is possible to become an entrepreneur with a reduced risk of failure by taking over an established firm rather than building an enterprise from scratch, the EU should ensure that such enterprises do not close because of obstacles in the tax and legal environment or the lack of a successor. The Commission will foster implementation of the Recommendation on Business Transfers;        Reviewing social security schemes for entrepreneurs        . In order to determine more precisely the influence of social security on the attractiveness of entrepreneurship, the Commission is planning to present an overview of social security schemes for the self-employed and business owners, including their spouses and other dependants, and the effects of transition from one status to another. Based on this, the Commission will ask the Member States to define the areas in which they intend to take action and will then organise an exchange of experience involving external experts about how best to make progress.      Taking account of demographic ageing and the fact that the age group that is most active in setting up businesses (25-34 years) will be less visible in the future, the action plan calls on the Member States to react quickly.      Gearing entrepreneurs for growth and competitiveness      The EU has taken a whole range of initiatives to enable small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to make the most of the opportunities offered by the knowledge-based economy. It has, for example, reserved 15% of the budget for the       6th Framework Programme      for RTD for SMEs. It has also extended the scope of the Block Exemption Regulation to R&D aid granted to SMEs. Focusing more specifically on entrepreneurship, this Communication proposes:       Providing tailor-made support for women and ethnic minorities        . The Commission intends to promote access to top-class support and management training for entrepreneurs from all backgrounds, including groups with specific needs, such as women and entrepreneurs from ethnic minorities. In this context, the Commission plans to assist the national and regional authorities to address those areas where the needs of female entrepreneurs are still insufficiently met, notably access to finance and entrepreneurial networks, and to identify and evaluate policy measures with a view to identifying good practices to assist ethnic minority entrepreneurs;        Supporting businesses in developing inter-enterprise relations        . The Commission will reinforce the role of the European support networks 'Euro Info Centres (EICs)' and the 'Innovation Relay Centres (IRCs)' by involving them in promoting business cooperation and ensuring streamlined delivery of all EU-wide support services, not only by these networks, but also by the Business Innovation Centres (BICs).      As noted in the Green Paper on Entrepreneurship, too few fast-growing enterprises, or "gazelles", which are the key drivers of innovation and entrepreneurial dynamism, emerge in Europe. Entrepreneurial growth rarely happens by chance: entrepreneurs primarily seek inspiration from successful role models. The Commission will therefore seek good policy practices for disseminating as role models and providing suitable support to potential gazelles.      Improving the flow of finance      The Commission helps to improve the financial environment for enterprises, especially SMEs, through its financial instruments and by bringing together SMEs and financial players to allow the exchange of good practice and make for a better mutual understanding among SMEs and the financial community.     This Communication proposes       creating more equity      and stronger balance sheets in firms. The Commission intends to use its financial instruments for SMEs to facilitate entrepreneurial growth by stimulating the supply of both debt and equity finance. It also plans to intensify its actions to improve the availability of venture capital, "business angel" finance, and investments by private individuals ("micro-angels").     The Commission also plans to analyse the impact of State aid and remedy possible market failures in the provision of funding for SMEs, particularly young and growth-oriented ones.      Creating a more SME-friendly regulatory and administrative framework      The Internal Market has made the life of businesses, particularly SMEs, much easier. However, its completion remains a priority, as there are still a number of obstacles that need to be removed. The Commission is continuing to promote the involvement of SMEs in standardisation. It also wants more       effective consultation of SMEs      to allow them to give their opinions on new initiatives at an early stage of the decision-making process and about the adequacy of existing regulations and practices.     This Communication also proposes       reducing the complexity of complying with tax laws      . An enterprise operating in an intra-European environment has to comply with different national tax laws and regulations, which can become an obstacle to cross-border activities, particularly for SMEs. To simplify and reduce tax compliance procedures related to direct taxation, the Commission intends to launch a pilot scheme whereby SMEs can apply 'Home State Taxation'. This should lead to considerable savings and efficiency gains for qualifying SMEs.     For several categories of business-to-consumer transactions, application of VAT at the place of consumption means traders have to be identified and make returns and payments in every Member State where they carry out taxable transactions. This is burdensome for traders within the Internal Market. The Commission intends to propose a 'one-stop-shop' system to enable firms to deal with one single tax authority, in their own language, and to benefit from a single set of compliance obligations.     REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACTION PLAN     In September 2006 the report prepared by the Commission (       PDF      ) concluded that most of the initiatives presented in the action plan had in the meantime been implemented.     As an example, Community funding for measures to help businesses has increased, and       access to funding      has been made easier. Progress has also been made in the field of       entrepreneurship education      by offering people from a very young age a real chance to acquire basic commercial expertise and develop their personal qualities and general skills such as creativity, sense of initiative, self-confidence and sense of responsibility.     The action plan has thus proved to be a valuable tool in achieving the aim of promoting entrepreneurship. The initiatives to which it has given rise are now continuing under the       Community SME policy      .

   Passengers and goods: Driver attestation     Passengers and goods: Driver attestation     This regulation aims to establish a uniform Community attestation permitting the effective checking of the regularity of the employment status of drivers from third countries employed by hauliers in the Member States engaged in the international carriage of goods.     ACT     Regulation (EC) No       484/2002      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 1 March 2002 amending Council Regulations (EEC) No       881/92      and (EEC) No 3118/93 for the purposes of establishing a driver attestation [Official Journal L 76, 19.03.2002].     SUMMARY      Background      The impossibility of checking whether drivers are legally employed or used outside the territory of the Member State where a haulier is established has given rise to a market in which drivers from third countries are sometimes irregularly used only to carry out the international carriage of goods outside the Member State in which the haulier employing them is established. This Regulation has been designed to combat such practices.     These irregularly employed drivers often work in precarious conditions and are poorly paid, which is a threat to road safety. This situation seriously distorts competition between hauliers engaged in such practices and those that use only legally employed drivers.      New rules      International carriage by road was already subject to a Community authorisation under Regulation (EEC) No       881/92      . Under Regulation (EC) No       484/2002      , drivers who are nationals of third countries must from now on be in possession of a driver attestation.     The attestation must certify that a driver is employed in the haulier's Member State of establishment in accordance with the laws and regulations applicable in that Member State.     The scope of the Regulation is restricted to drivers from non-member countries. The scope may be extended to drivers who are nationals of Member States, after evaluation by the Commission.     Driver attestations will be issued by a Member State to the haulier requesting them for each driver who is the national of a third country and whom he legally employs.     The attestation must comply with the model in the Annex to the Regulation. Driver attestations are issued for a period to be determined by the issuing Member State, subject however to a maximum validity of five years. The attestation must be produced whenever required by authorised inspecting officers.     The competent authorities of a Member State may withdraw a driver attestation where the holder:      has failed to observe the conditions in accordance with which the attestation was issued;       has supplied incorrect information in relation to the data required for the issue or renewal of a driver attestation.      A certified true copy of the driver attestation must be kept at the haulier's premises.     The original driver attestation must be kept on board the vehicle and presented for inspection whenever required by authorised inspecting officers.          Act               Date of entry into force               Deadline for implementation by the Member States               Regulation (EC) N°                 484/2002                19.03.2002               19.03.2003          Last updated: 19.07.2006  
summary of   Regulation (EC) No 812/2004 — measures concerning incidental catches of cetaceans in fisheries   what is the aim of the regulation  It introduces measures to reduce incidental catches (known as  by-catches  ) by fishing vessels of whales, dolphins and porpoises (a group of marine mammals known as cetaceans).   key points   The regulation introduces:    technical measures  concerning gill nets (a fishing net that is hung vertically so that fish get trapped in it by their gills) and trawls (a fishing net) in specified areas (listed in the regulation’s Annexes I and III);    a monitoring scheme  on board fishing vessels to obtain information on by-catches of cetaceans in  ‘at risk’ fisheries   *  (see Annex III).    Acoustic deterrent devices    Acoustic deterrent devices of various types have been developed. These devices (often known as ‘pingers’)  emit signals  designed to keep cetaceans away from fishing gear.   All fishing vessels of  12 metres or longer  fishing in the specified zones for the given fishing period must use the devices.   Masters of fishing vessels must ensure that the devices are  fully operational  when setting the gear.   European Union (EU) countries must  monitor and evaluate the effects  of the use of the devices over time.   The devices’  technical specifications  (e.g. signal characteristics) and  conditions of use  (i.e. the maximum spacing between devices on nets) are set out in Annex II of the regulation.   Exceptionally, EU countries may authorise the use for up to 2 years of devices which do not fulfil the specifications or conditions of use, provided that their use has been sufficiently documented.    Monitoring schemes for incidental catches    EU countries must design and implement  monitoring schemes for incidental catches  of cetaceans by fishing vessels flying their flag. The object of the exercise is to obtain representative data on the fisheries listed in annex III.   For vessels of  under 15 metres  in length, data are collected by means of  studies  or  pilot projects  .   For vessels that are  15 metres or longer  , the monitoring is done by  on-board observers  .   In respect of the  observers  , the legislation lays down:   their  qualifications  (e.g. relevant experience in cetacean species and fishing practices;   their  capacity  to accomplish certain elementary scientific tasks, etc.);   their  tasks  (monitor incidental catches and collect the data necessary to extrapolate the by-catch observed to the whole fishery concerned);   the  content of the report  that observers must send about the data they have collected, their observations and findings.      Reports    Each year, EU countries must send a report to the  European Commission  . This report should:   contain  estimates of the overall incidental catches  of cetaceans in each of the fisheries concerned;   include an assessment of the  conclusions of the observers’ reports  and any other appropriate information, including any research done to reduce the incidental capture of cetaceans in fisheries.     from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 1 July 2004.   background   Whales, dolphins and porpoises are all protected under the EU’s  Habitats Directive  which requires EU countries to undertake surveillance of the conservation status of these species. The EU has therefore taken specific measures to ensure that the impact of fishing activities is minimised.   * key terms     ‘at risk’ fisheries:  in the context of this summary, fisheries where the cetacean population is under particular threat due to fishing activities.
   Partnership for democracy and prosperity with the Southern Mediterranean     Partnership for democracy and prosperity with the Southern Mediterranean     The Commission presents the principal elements of a new partnership between the European Union and the Southern Mediterranean countries. This partnership aims to support those countries engaged in political and economic reforms contributing towards increasing human rights and freedoms.     ACT     Joint Communication to the European Council, the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 8 March 2011 – A Partnership for democracy and shared prosperity with the Southern Mediterranean [       COM(2011) 200      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     A new strategy for cooperation should enable the European Union (EU) to strengthen its support for those Southern Mediterranean countries undertaking political and economic reforms.     This renewed partnership should be based on the results of the Barcelona Process and the       Union for the Mediterranean      . The Mediterranean partners must be ready to deepen their political cooperation, including on matters of external and security policy. They must demonstrate their ability to respect human rights and democratic processes.     The strategy should be implemented following a differentiated approach, in order to meet the needs of each country. In addition, the pace of reforms should determine the amount of financial assistance provided and whether the country may progress to the advanced status of association, based on the       Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements      .      Supporting democracy      The priority reforms supported by the EU concern the functioning of public administration, political processes and tax systems, as well as the fight against corruption and illicit financial flows.     The strategy also commits the partners to improving social dialogue and the role of civil society, in particular through the creation of a Civil Society Neighbourhood Facility.      Improving the mobility of persons      The partners must establish frameworks for cooperation to promote the mobility of persons (particularly in the areas of visas and legal immigration, migration for seasonal work, managing remittances sent by migrants, return and reintegration programmes, etc.).     In addition, the EU plans actions to support the capacity of its partners to manage migration flows, concerning the integration of migrants and border security (fighting against irregular immigration, trafficking in human beings, trans-border crime and corruption, etc.).      Promoting inclusive economic development      The strategy should contribute towards identifying the social and economic reforms needed in order to improve economic stability and job creation in the partner countries.     The Commission identifies additional priorities concerning the quality of education systems, the legislation applicable to small and medium-sized enterprises, regional trade integration and Euro-Mediterranean cooperation in the industrial sector.      Promoting trade and investment      Improvements to the business climate are required in order to encourage trade and direct foreign investment. The strategy must also support strengthening the rule of law and the judiciary, tackling corruption and overhauling administrative procedures.     The EU has concluded trade agreements with all of its Mediterranean partners (except for Syria). These agreements should be supplemented by measures tailored to each country in the following areas:      agricultural and fisheries products;       the conformity of industrial products;       the liberalisation of trade in services;        Pan-Euro-Mediterranean        preferential rules of origin.      In addition, the renewed partnership should lead to the negotiation of Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreements       *      with the aim of creating free trade areas.      Enhancing sectoral cooperation      New initiatives for cooperation should be launched, specifically in the following sectors:      energy, by adopting a joint approach for energy security and the production of renewable energies;       agriculture, food supply and food security;       vocational education and training, in particular to tackle illiteracy and to develop student exchange programmes;       aviation and maritime safety;       information and communication technologies, by improving the applicable regulatory framework and the conditions of competition.       Financial assistance      The financial priorities of the       European Neighbourhood Policy      must be re-defined following adoption of the strategy. The financial assistance should be increased and diversified, including having access to finance from international financial institutions, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and the       European Investment Bank      (EIB).     In addition, the EU may consider granting macroeconomic assistance to its partners affected by the international financial crisis.       Key terms         Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area: a trade agreement covering a large number of areas and aiming at regulatory approximation in order to facilitate trade between States. This type of agreement provides for a partial opening of the EU internal market to a non-EU country. It is currently only offered to ENP countries.       Last updated: 27.06.2011  
summary of   Directive 2011/92/EU on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment   what is the aim of the directive  Known as the EIA Directive, the directive aims to ensure:   a high level of environmental protection;   environmental considerations are integrated into the preparation and authorisation of projects.   This objective is achieved by ensuring that environmental assessment of certain public and private projects listed in the directive’s Annexes I and II (airports, nuclear installations, railways, roads, waste disposal installations, waste water treatment plants, etc.) is carried out.  The EIA Directive applies to a wide range of public and private projects.   key points   Directive 2011/92/EU defines the  environmental impact assessment (EIA)  process which ensures that projects likely to have significant effects on the environment are made subject to an assessment, prior to their authorisation.  Amending legislation (Directive  2014/52/EU  ) was adopted in 2014. In line with the drive for smarter regulation, it:   helps reduce administrative burden;   improves the level of environmental protection to permit sounder, more predictable and sustainable business decisions on public and private investments;   takes into account threats and challenges that have emerged since the original rules came into force 30 years ago. This means paying more attention to aspects like resource efficiency, climate change and disaster prevention, which are now better reflected in the assessment process.   The main amendments are:   EU countries can  simplify their different environmental assessment procedures  .    Timeframes  are introduced for the different stages of environmental assessments.   The  screening  procedure, determining whether an EIA is required, is simplified.    Decisions must be duly motivated  in the light of the updated screening criteria.    EIA reports  are to be made more understandable for the public, especially as regards assessments of the current state of the environment and alternatives to the project in question.   The  quality and the content of the reports  is improved. Competent authorities also need to prove their  objectivity  to avoid conflicts of interest.   The grounds for  development consent decisions   *  must be clear and more transparent for the public.   If projects do entail  significant adverse effects  on the environment, developers are obliged to avoid, prevent or reduce those effects. These projects must be  monitored  .    The EIA process   The EIA process operates as follows:   the  project developer  may request the competent authority to specify what should be covered by the EIA information to be provided (scoping stage);    the developer must provide information on the environmental impact  (in the form of an EIA report drafted in accordance with Annex IV of the directive);   the  environmental authorities  and the  public  , as well as  local and regional authorities  (as well as any EU countries that are affected) must be informed and consulted;   the  competent authority  decides taking into consideration the  results of consultations  ; this decision also includes a  reasoned conclusion  on the significant effects of the project;   the  authority  informs the public of its decision;   the  public  can challenge the decision before the courts.    Public consultations   Consultation with the public is a key feature of EIA process. To ensure effective public participation,  the EIA report and other information  must be provided as early as possible. This can be done electronically, by public notices or bill posting, or via local newspapers.   Responsibility of national authorities   Authorities have to decide within  a reasonable time  whether to approve the project or not. They must make available to the public, as well as to environmental, local and regional bodies, the content of a positive decision, including the main reasons for their approval and any  environmental or other conditions they attach  . If they refuse development consent, they should explain why.  EU countries may lay down  more stringent conditions  and fix  penalties  for any infringements.   from when does the directive apply  Directive 2011/92/EU has applied since 17 February 2012. It  codifies  4 earlier directives (  85/337/EEC  ,  97/11/EC  ,  2003/35/EC  and  2009/31/EC  ) the first of which became law in the EU countries on 3 July 1988.  Amending Directive  2014/52/EU  has applied since 25 April 2014 and had to become law in the EU countries by 16 May 2017.   background   For more information, see:    Environmental Impact Assessment — EIA  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Development consent decision:  a decision by the competent authorities to approve a project.
   Equal opportunities for people with disabilities     Equal opportunities for people with disabilities     The aim of these two texts is to promote equal opportunities for people with disabilities by incorporating disability issues into Community policies and to consolidate cooperation between Member States in preventing all forms of discrimination on grounds of disability.     ACT     Communication of the Commission of 30 July 1996 on equality of opportunity for people with disabilities: A New European Community Disability Strategy [       COM(96) 406      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     Resolution of the Council and of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States meeting within the Council of 20 December 1996 on equality of opportunity for people with disabilities [Official Journal C 12 of 13.01.1997].     SUMMARY      Communication      One out of ten citizens in the European Community has a disability, which may be of a physical, sensory, mental or psychic nature.     There are still a number of obstacles to the integration of people with disabilities into society:      in education, many children with disabilities are excluded from mainstream schools and are confined to institutions which give them no opportunity for normal social interaction;       in the field of employment, a great number of people with disabilities within the working age are excluded from the labour market; they are also two to three times more likely to be unemployed and to be so for longer periods than the rest of the working population;       many transport systems and public buildings continue to be inaccessible or accessible only with difficulty to people with disabilities;       as regards housing, suitably adapted or adaptable accommodation is in short supply and prohibitively expensive;       welfare systems tend to provide a minimum level of support, falling some way short of achieving the goal of integration.      Historically, the response to disability has been mainly one of social compensation through charity and the development of specialist caring services outside the mainstream of society. However necessary and well intentioned they might be, such responses have compounded the problem of exclusion and under-participation.     The traditional approaches are slowly giving way to a stronger emphasis on identifying and removing the various barriers to equal opportunities and full participation in all aspects of life.     Responsibility for eliminating exclusion and discrimination based on disability lies primarily with the Member States. The new approach is already being implemented in all the Member States, in different ways and at different speeds.     The Commission considers that Community-level involvement can bring significant added value to the efforts of the Member States. The strategy will be organised along the following lines:      consolidation of the cooperation with and between the Member States: establishment of a high-level group of Member State representatives on disability,       development of social dialogue focusing on disability-related issues;       continued support for non-governmental organisations working in the field of disability to encourage European cooperation;       incorporation of disability issues into the formulation of Community policy proposals: an interdepartmental group focussed on issues relating to disability has been set up by the Commission.       strengthening of measures to prevent long-term unemployment and to integrate disabled people into working life in line with the European employment strategy;       assessment of the extent and impact of Structural Fund action targeting people with disabilities, with particular reference to combating social exclusion.       Resolution      The Council reaffirms its commitment to equal opportunities for people with disabilities and to the principle of avoiding or abolishing all forms of negative discrimination based solely on disability.     The Council calls upon the Member States to ascertain whether their policies take account of the need to eliminate all obstacles to full participation in social life by disabled people and to educate public opinion to be receptive to the abilities of disabled people. Member States are equally encouraged to promote the participation of disabled people in the implementing and following-up of the policies and relevant actions.     The Council calls upon the Commission to integrate the dimension of "equality of opportunity for people with disabilities" into all its relevant proposals and to encourage the exchange of useful information and experience, particularly with regard to innovative policies and good practice. The Commission is also called upon to present periodic reports summarising the progress made and obstacles encountered in implementing the resolution on the basis of information supplied by the Member States.     RELATED ACTS      Resolution of the Council and of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States meeting within the Council of 17 June 1999 on equal employment opportunities for people with disabilities [Official Journal C 186 of 02.07.1999].      The Council calls on the Member States to:      place particular emphasis on the promotion of employment opportunities for people with disabilities and to develop preventive and active policies to promote their integration into the labour market;       make full use of the existing and future possibilities of the European Structural Funds, in particular the European Social Fund;       attach particular attention to the possibilities offered by the development of the information society.      The Council invites the social partners at all levels to play an increasing role in creating improved employment opportunities and negotiated work organisation changes in cooperation with people with disabilities.     The Council invites people with disabilities themselves and their organisations to make their contribution towards the goal of equal employment opportunities by sharing and exchanging their experience with all those involved in the labour market..     The Council encourages the Community institutions to promote equal employment opportunities for people with disabilities within their own services.     The Council calls upon the Commission to work together with the Member States, in particular within the framework of the European employment guidelines, to monitor and analyse the development of the employment of people with disabilities and to develop new strategies and campaigns, taking into consideration national, regional and local differences.     The Council affirms that, in the framework of a coherent global policy, equal employment opportunities for people with disabilities will be enhanced if specific attention is given to areas such as workplace accommodation, access to the place of work, qualifications and skills required at work and access to vocational guidance and placement services.      Resolution of the Council and of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States meeting within the Council of 15 July 2003 on promoting the employment and social integration of people with disabilities [Official Journal C 175 of 24.07.2003].      The Council calls on the Member States and the Commission, within the framework of their respective powers, to take new and concrete measures to promote the employment and social integration of people with disabilities.

summary of   Directive 2014/17/EU –rules on home loans   what is the aim of the directive  Known as ‘the Mortgage Credit Directive’, it aims to ensure that all consumers who take out a mortgage to purchase a property are adequately informed and protected against the risks.   key points    The directive applies to all loans made to consumers for the purpose of buying a home, including loans that are guaranteed by a mortgage or by another comparable security.   It provides for better information to consumers on available mortgage products including:   an obligation on lenders to provide consumers with a standardised information sheet (  European Standardised Information Sheet  - ESIS) which allows them to shop around to identify the right product for them;   inclusion in the ESIS of worst-case scenarios regarding variable interest and foreign currency loans so as to alert consumers of potential interest rate variations;   a guaranteed period of reflection or a right of withdrawal for borrowers prior to being bound by the credit agreement;   new EU-wide standards to assess the credit worthiness of mortgage applicants so as to ensure that borrowers can meet their repayment obligations.     The directive establishes business conduct principles.   These ensure that lenders and credit intermediaries (i.e. persons or companies providing information and assistance to consumers looking for a mortgage loan) act honestly and transparently in the consumer’s interests.   Lenders and intermediaries must ensure that their staff have up-to-date knowledge on loan agreements and that customers are provided with all the necessary information before signing any agreement.     Consumers have a general right to repay their loans early, thus benefiting from a reduction in the total remaining cost of the mortgage. In such cases, EU countries may entitle lenders to fair compensation for any costs directly and exclusively linked to early repayment.   The directive establishes an EU passport regime for credit intermediaries. This means that in principle once authorised in one EU country, a credit intermediary is allowed to provide services throughout the EU.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 20 March 2014. EU countries had to incorporate it in national law by 21 March 2016.   background   For more information, see:    Mortgage credit  (  European Commission  ).
summary of   Regulation 2017/1938 aiming to safeguard an uninterrupted supply of gas throughout the EU   what is the aim of this regulation  It aims to strengthen EU energy security by helping prevent potential supply disruptions — and to respond to them when they occur — to ensure that households and other vulnerable consumers are always supplied.  The regulation forms part of the  Energy Union package  , which aims to make energy secure, affordable and sustainable through closer cooperation between EU countries.   key points   Gas security of supply is the shared responsibility of natural gas companies, EU countries and the  European Commission  . The main elements of the regulation are:    better cooperation and coordination  between groups of EU countries in regional groups to assess common supply risks together and to develop and agree on joint preventive and emergency measures;   introduction of the  solidarity mechanism  through which EU countries must help each other to always guarantee gas supply to the most vulnerable consumers — even in severe gas supply situations — under fair compensation conditions by the country receiving solidarity;   improvement of  transparency  thanks to the obligation placed on gas companies to notify to their national authority their major long-term gas supply contracts that may be relevant for security of supply;   the  European Network of Transmission System Operators (ENTSOG)  will carry out  a 4-yearly EU-wide simulation  of gas supply and infrastructure disruption scenarios;   EU countries have specific  obligations to the  Energy Community   , with the Commission coordinating the legal rules.    Repeal   The regulation repeals  Regulation (EU) No 994/2010  .   from when does this regulation apply  It has applied since 1 November 2017.   background   For more information, see:    Secure gas supplies  (  European Commission  ).
act   Council Directive  77/538/EEC  of 28 June 1977 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to rear fog lamps for motor vehicles and their trailers   summary    Directive   77/538/EEC   Rear fog lamp means the lamp used to render the vehicle more readily visible from the rear in dense fog.  Each Member State must grant component type-approval for any type of rear fog lamp which satisfies the construction and testing requirements laid down in the Annexes to the Directive, and issue an EC component type-approval mark. The Member State which has granted EC component type-approval must take the measures required in order to verify that production models conform to the approved type.   Member States may not:    prohibit the placing on the market of rear fog lamps on grounds relating to their construction or method of functioning if they bear the EC component type-approval mark.   refuse to grant EC type-approval or national type-approval of any vehicle on grounds relating to its rear fog lamps if these bear the EC component type-approval mark and are fitted in accordance with the requirements laid down in Directive 76/756/EEC.   prohibit the sale, registration, entry into service or use of any vehicle on grounds relating to its rear fog lamps if these bear the EC component type-approval mark and are fitted in accordance with the requirements laid down in Directive  76/756/EEC  .    Directive   89/518/EEC   This Directive adapts the previous Directive to technical progress, and simplifies the EC component type-approval mark for rear fog lamps where they are grouped together with, combined with or reciprocally incorporated in other lamps. The definitions set out in Directive  76/756/EEC  (grouped lamps, combined lamps, light source with regard to filament lamps, etc.) are also applicable to Directive  77/538/EEC  .   Directive   99/14/EC   In the light of technical progress, this Directive radically amends the Annexes to Directive  77/538/EEC  , in particular with regard to the information document and type-approval certificate. Directive  99/14/EC  also simplifies the type-approval procedures to maintain the equivalence between Directive  77/538/EEC  and the corresponding regulations of the United Nations' Economic Commission for Europe.  From 1 April 2000, Member States may no longer grant EC type-approval, and may refuse to grant national type-approval, for any type of vehicle on grounds relating to rear fog lamps, if the requirements of Directive  77/538/EEC  are not fulfilled.  Any amendments necessary to adapt the provisions in the Annexes to technical progress will be adopted pursuant to the procedure set out in Article 13 of Directive  70/156/EEC  .  Directive 77/538/EEC is repealed by Regulation (EC) No 661/2009 with effect from 12 November 2014.

act   Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Central Bank, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and the European Investment Bank: An investment plan for Europe (  COM(2014) 903 final  of 26.11.2014).   summary    background   The communication sets out an investment plan to serve three policy objectives:   reverse downward investment trends and help boost job creation and economic recovery, without weighing on national public finances or creating new debt;   move towards meeting the long-term needs of the EU economy and increase competitiveness;   strengthen the European dimension of human capital, productive capacity, knowledge and physical infrastructure, with a special focus on aspects vital to the EU’s single market.   what will the plan do   Mobilise at least €315 billion in additional investment over 3 years, maximising the impact of public resources and unlocking private investment.   Target initiatives to ensure that this extra investment meets the needs of the real economy.   Put in place measures to provide simpler, better and more predictable regulation, in particular removing obstacles to growth.   Reinforce the level-playing field and remove barriers to investment in the single market.   Open up new sources of long-term financing.   key points   A new European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) is being set up in partnership between the European Commission and the  European Investment Bank  (EIB).  Initially, the EU budget will guarantee €16 billion, and the EIB will commit €5 billion. EU countries and private companies have the opportunity to contribute, with every €1 billion of funding resulting in at least €20 billion of capital.  A pipeline of projects will be established at EU level, and an investment advisory ‘hub’ will be set up to bring together expertise and strengthen technical assistance at all levels. The Commission will engage with investors, project promoters and institutional stakeholders to facilitate key investment projects and make sure projects access appropriate sources of funding.

   Cooperation between special intervention units     Cooperation between special intervention units     This Decision aims to improve cooperation between Member States’ special intervention units in man-made crisis situations that present a serious and direct physical threat. The Decision establishes the general rules and conditions for the provision of assistance by these units to any requesting Member State.     ACT     Council Decision       2008/617/JHA      of 23 June 2008 on the improvement of cooperation between the special intervention units of the Member States of the European Union in crisis situations.     SUMMARY     This Decision sets out the general rules and conditions for the cooperation of Member States’ special intervention units       *      in situations of crisis       *      . Cooperation is based on the provision of assistance and/or on the carrying out of operations on the territory of the requesting Member State. The details for implementing the practical aspects of the cooperation are settled between the requesting and the requested Member States directly.     The competent authority       *      of a Member State processes the request for assistance from another Member State’s special intervention unit. The request must specify the nature of and the operational necessity for the assistance. The requested Member State’s competent authority may either accept or refuse the request, or propose assistance in another form.     The assistance provided may consist of:      equipment;       expertise;       carrying out operations on the requesting Member State’s territory.      When carrying out operations, the requested Member State’s special intervention unit has a supporting role. It is to provide the assistance under the responsibility, authority and direction of the requesting Member State. While the operations fall under the jurisdiction of the requesting Member State, the requested Member State’s officers may act only within the limits of their powers as defined by their national law.     The Member States taking part in this form of cooperation must ensure that experience, expertise and information on managing crisis situations are exchanged. To this end, the special intervention units are to hold meetings and joint trainings and exercises. These may be funded from certain Community financial programmes. Hence, the responsibility for the organisation of these events lies with the Member State holding the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. All operational costs however, including those of the requested Member State’s special intervention unit, are to be borne by the requesting Member State, unless the cooperating Member States decide otherwise.     An up-to-date list of the Member States’ competent authorities is maintained by the General Secretariat of the Council.      Background      The Council Declaration on Solidarity against Terrorism of 25 March 2004 established the basis for cooperation between Member States in the event of terrorist attacks.     Council Decision 2008/617/JHA complements Council Decision       2008/615/JHA      of 23 June 2008 on the       stepping up of cross-border cooperation      , particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime, whose article 18 lays down the obligation for Member States to provide one another assistance in connection with mass gatherings, disasters and serious accidents.       Key terms used in the act         Special intervention unit: any law enforcement unit of a Member State that is specialised in the control of a crisis situation.         Crisis situation: any situation in which the competent authorities of a Member State have reasonable grounds to believe that there is a criminal offence presenting a serious direct physical threat to persons, property, infrastructure or institutions of that Member State.         Competent authority: the national authority that may make requests and give authorisations regarding the deployment of the special intervention units.

   The Social Policy Agenda (2006-2010)     The Social Policy Agenda (2006-2010)     The European Commission proposes a new social policy agenda for the period 2005-2010. The main objective of this new agenda is "a social Europe in the global economy: jobs and opportunities for all".     ACT     Communication from the Commission. The Social Agenda [       COM(2005) 33      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This communication identifies the priorities that should guide the European Union's action in the development of the European social model. It is also intended to promote social cohesion as part both of the       Lisbon strategy      and the       Sustainable Development Strategy      . This review of the Agenda has a key role in promoting the social dimension of economic growth and improving the implementation of the measures foreseen by the old       Social Agenda (2000-2005)      .     The added value of the Social Agenda is beyond doubt because it facilitates the modernisation of national systems against a background of far-reaching economic and social changes. It supports the harmonious operation of the single market while ensuring respect for fundamental rights and common values.     The Agenda develops a two-pronged strategy: Firstly, it emphasises its role in strengthening citizens' confidence; secondly, it presents key measures under two major headings, namely employment and equal opportunities and inclusion.      STRENGTHENING CITIZENS' CONFIDENCE      The measures proposed are designed to enable citizens to gain confidence in their own ability to effectively manage change, viz.: increased competition in a global context, technological development and population ageing.     In this context, the Agenda presents several key conditions:      an intergenerational approach;       a partnership for change;       integration of the external dimension       An intergenerational approach      The changes brought about by the demographic development - notably the ageing of the European populations - the need to adapt systems of social protection and pensions to these changes, the need to improve the integration of young people and to address the whole question of migration are major challenges.     To this end, the Commission plans to analyse future challenges and proposes a series of measures to analyse the demographic changes of European populations.      A partnership for change      Given that the partnership between the authorities, the social partners and civil society is one of the keys to the success of European policies, the Commission will propose the organisation of an annual meeting of all players concerned in a forum. The aim of this meeting will be to evaluate the implementation of the Agenda on a regular basis.      Integration of the external dimension      The Commission also plans to incorporate the European social model into external dialogue and measures at bilateral, regional and multilateral level      THE TWO PRIORITY AREAS      The two priority areas concerning the strategic objectives of the new Agenda are:      employment, under the prosperity objective;       equal opportunities and inclusion, under the solidarity objective.       Achieving full employment      In order to attain the Lisbon growth and jobs objectives, the Commission has proposed a revamped cycle of the European Employment Strategy (EES) in the framework of the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy. This new cycle should underpin long-term economic growth, combat unemployment and regional disparities and promote social cohesion.     To ensure that the European Social Fund fosters convergence, employment and competitiveness, the Commission plans to put forward several measures, notably a measure to sensitise the ESF players in 2006 and a communication campaign among parliaments and players concerned in 2006-2007.     The Commission also proposes developing a strategy for anticipating, triggering and managing economic change more effectively. This strategy is developed around four themes:      greater interplay between European policies;       greater involvement of the social partners;       greater synergy between policies and their financial levers, especially the ESF;       a stronger link between the EES and the development of the legal frameworks and social partners' agreements.      In this new Agenda, the Commission also introduces a new dynamic for industrial relations and provides for several initiatives concerning the development of labour law, health and safety at work and corporate social responsibility     The Commission considers that the creation of a genuine European labour market is essential. This objective implies both removing the remaining direct and indirect barriers and, besides, drawing up policies that create the conditions for the players concerned to derive maximum benefit from the European area.     With a view to giving the social partners a basis for increasing their capacity to act at transnational level, the Commission plans to adopt a proposal designed to make it possible for the social partners to formalise the nature and results of transnational collective bargaining in an optimal way.      Equal opportunities and inclusion      The EU has been a driving force in implementing the principle of equal treatment. As the current framework strategy 2000-2005 comes to an end, the Commission plans to propose several actions to resolve such problems as the gender pay gap, women's access to and participation in the labour market, training, career advancement, reconciliation of family and working life, equal opportunities for the disabled, etc.     The Commission also plans to organise a European year of equal opportunities in 2007 with a view to highlighting the results achieved and showing the advantages of diversity for the economy and society of Europe.

summary of   Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1294 on the EU’s renewable energy financing mechanism   what is the aim of the regulation  This  implementing regulation  sets out the rules on the functioning of the new  EU  renewable energy financing mechanism in line with Regulation (EU)  2018/1999  on  governance of the energy union  .  The mechanism supports new renewable energy projects across the EU and contributes to the renewable energy deployment in accordance with Directive (EU)  2018/2001  on  renewable energy  .   key points    Funding  comes from  three sources  :   EU countries’ governments may provide voluntary payments;   other EU programmes and funds may make contributions, especially to reduce the cost of capital for renewable energy projects or to support regional cooperation inside the EU and with non-EU countries;   the private sector may offer finance, with the option of indicating the project, technology or end-use it would like to support.    All financing  must respect  EU financial rules  as set out in Regulation (EU, Euratom)  2018/1046  (see  summary  ).  The  European Commission  asks EU governments every year whether they would like to provide voluntary payment (contributing country) or to allow renewable energy to be installed on their territory (host country).   Host countries  must provide certain information, such as:   maximum total capacity or renewable energy available to projects financed by the mechanism;   preferred technologies or end-use sectors;   any site or geographical restrictions.    Contributing countries  must provide certain information, such as:   volume of renewable energy they intend to support and benefit from in statistical allocations;   their maximum financial contribution;   preference for technology-neutral, multi-technology, technology-specific, project-specific or end-use specific grant award procedures.   The  Commission  :   designs, on the basis of the offers and requests received, tenders (referred to as calls for proposals) specifying, for instance:   call’s objectives,   form of grants (investment or operating support) and award criteria,   ceiling price of proposals,   eligible technologies;     informs EU countries it intends to launch a call for proposals;   launches the call or calls, including the eligibility and selection criteria, after receiving binding commitments from host countries, whereby they will allow installations on their soil to receive the financial support, and from contributing countries, whereby they will provide the money they offered.   If a  project promoter  fails to deliver on their commitment, the rules on suspension, termination and reduction in Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 apply.  The  grant award system  :   contains principles to ensure a competitive process, mitigate financial risk and limit transactions costs;   provides scope for different procedures depending on the technology or projects involved;   allocates grants to:   increase renewable energy production capacity (investment support),   give incentives to operate renewable energy installations by providing premiums in addition to market revenues (operating support).      Implementation periods  reflect realistic delivery periods and are technology-specific and uniform across the EU, unless the Commission determines otherwise.  Projects financed by the renewable energy scheme may receive funding from other EU, national, public or private programmes provided they respect  State aid  rules and the  EU budget  does not finance the same costs twice.  The  statistical benefits  of renewable energy from installations financed by the scheme are, in general, divided 80:20 between contributing and host countries — however, the Commission may alter this ratio — during the implementation or support period. Afterwards, they remain entirely with the host. These statistical benefits count towards the national share of renewable energy regardless of where and how the actual renewable energy from the installations is consumed.  The  Commission  :   calculates annually, on the basis of the available energy production data from participating EU and non-EU countries, the actual statistical benefits that participating countries receive;   reports by 31 October every year to the:   Energy Union Committee, and makes public how the financing mechanism is helping to meet the EU’s 2030 binding renewable targets and  European Green Deal  objectives (see  summary  ),   Energy Union Committee and to the  European Parliament  on the mechanism’s finances, including sums received, allocated and remaining.     from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 7 October 2020 and does not have a deadline.   background    The legislation aims to help EU countries cooperate more closely to meet their individual and collective renewable energy targets.

   Exposure to electromagnetic fields     Exposure to electromagnetic fields     This Directive lays down minimum requirements concerning the protection of workers from the risks arising from exposure to electromagnetic fields and waves.     ACT     Directive       2004/40/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (electromagnetic fields) (18th individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC) [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     This Directive forms part of a "package" of four directives on the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents:       noise      ,       vibration      , electromagnetic fields and       optical radiation      .     It is an individual directive under framework       Directive 89/391/EEC      on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work.      SCOPE      The Directive provides for measures to protect workers from the risks related to electromagnetic fields. However, it does not address the long-term effects, including the carcinogenic effects, that could result from exposure to electrical, magnetic and electromagnetic fields, for which there is no conclusive scientific data establishing a causal link.     Moreover, the Directive does not yet provide for exposure limits for static magnetic fields, for which further scientific evaluations are awaited.     The measures foreseen create a minimum basis of protection for all workers in the Union, leaving the Member States the option of keeping or adopting more favourable provisions. Moreover, its implementation cannot be used to justify any regression of the (possibly more favourable) provisions that apply in each Member State before its entry into force.      EXPOSURE LIMIT VALUES AND ACTION VALUES      The Directive lays down two types of value for exposure of workers:      "exposure limit values" defined in Table 1 of the Annex to the Directive on the basis of the various frequencies that are recognised as having harmful effects on the human cardiovascular system or the central nervous system or as being capable of causing whole-body heat stress or excessive localised heating of tissues;       "action values", or values above which employers must take the measures specified in the Directive. Compliance with these action values will ensure compliance with the relevant exposure limit values. These action values are obtained from the guidelines laid down by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). They are set out in Table 2 of the Annex to the Directive (13 frequency ranges that apply to all electromagnetic fields and are based on directly measurable parameters).       OBLIGATIONS OF EMPLOYERS      The Directive lays down various types of obligation with which employers must comply.      Determination of exposure and assessment of risks       assessment, measurement and calculation, by the appropriate services and at regular intervals, of the levels of electromagnetic fields to which workers are exposed;       saving of the results of this assessment on a suitable data storage medium so that they can be consulted at a later stage;       consideration in the assessment of risks (among other things, of the level, frequency spectrum, duration and type of exposure), of the indirect effects, such as interference with medical electronic equipment and devices, fires and explosions resulting from ignition of flammable materials.       Provisions designed to avoid or reduce risks      Once the action values are exceeded, employers must devise and implement an action plan comprising technical and/or organisational measures intended to prevent exposure from exceeding the exposure limit values (modification of working methods, choice of appropriate work equipment, better design of work stations, etc.). However, employers are not obliged to do so if they prove that there are no risks to the health of workers.     If, despite the measures taken by the employer to limit the risks, the exposure limit values are exceeded, the employer must take immediate action in order to reduce exposure to an authorised level.      Worker information and training      Exposed workers or their representatives must receive all necessary information and training, particularly relating to the outcome of the risk assessment, the measures taken by the employer, safe working practices, the detection of adverse effects and the circumstances in which workers are entitled to health surveillance.      Consultation and participation of workers      The Directive restricts itself to the requirements laid down in       framework Directive 89/391/EEC      .      MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS       Health surveillance      The Directive provides for the requirement of appropriate surveillance of the health of exposed workers with the objective of preventing any adverse effects due to exposure to electromagnetic fields.     Where exposure exceeds the limit values, a medical examination is foreseen. If it transpires that the health of the workers concerned has been harmed as a result of this exposure, a reassessment of the risks must be carried out.     Measures are also foreseen to ensure that the doctor responsible for the health surveillance has access to the results of the risk assessment, while the workers concerned will be able to have access to their own personal health records, at their request.      Sanctions      The Member States must provide for adequate sanctions in the event of infringement of the national provisions transposing the Directive.      Reports      Member States must provide a report to the Commission every five years on the practical implementation of the Directive, indicating the points of view of the social partners.     Every five years, the Commission must inform the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Advisory Committee on Safety and Health Protection at Work of the content of the reports of the Member States. It must also send them an assessment of developments in this field, in particular as regards exposure to static magnetic fields.

   A new framework for the open coordination of social protection and inclusion policies     A new framework for the open coordination of social protection and inclusion policies     The aim of this communication is to put in place an enhanced open method of coordination (OMC) for policies geared to providing social protection and combating poverty. This strengthened OMC will be more visible and will focus more on policy implementation, tying in more closely with the revised Lisbon Strategy. It will simplify the reporting process and will increase the opportunities for exchanging ideas between the Member States on the policy to be conducted.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 22 December 2005 "A new framework for the open coordination of social protection and inclusion policies" [       COM(2005) 706      - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY      EVALUATION OF WORK DONE UNDER THE OMC      Before making its proposals, the Commission asked the Member States, the social partners, NGOs and social protection institutions to complete a questionnaire on the OMC and its working methods.     The parties concerned believe that the OMC is worthwhile and that it has a positive impact on policy making. They are in favour of a more streamlined process in tandem with simplified reporting.     Streamlining should:      bring together the three strands of work, while allowing the specific features which are important to each of them to develop further. New integrated common objectives should not reduce the scope for in-depth focus on each area of operation;       support more learning and integrate it more effectively with the work of reporting and evaluation;       foster good interaction with the revised Lisbon Strategy and the re-launched Sustainable Development Strategy;       promote the practice of involving stakeholders who have made the most headway in the relevant field.       NEW COMMON OBJECTIVES FOR THE STRENGTHENED OMC      These new objectives are based on the existing objectives set out in Nice as regards inclusion and in Laeken as regards pensions.      General objectives       Promote social cohesion and equal opportunities for all through adequate, accessible, financially sustainable, adaptable and efficient social protection systems and social inclusion policies;       Interact closely with the Lisbon objectives for achieving greater economic growth and more and better jobs, as well as with the Union's Sustainable Development Strategy;       Improve governance, transparency and the involvement of stakeholders in the design, implementation and monitoring of policy.       Objectives applying to the different fields of operation        Making a decisive impact on the eradication of poverty and social exclusion       - Ensure the active inclusion of all by promoting participation in the labour market and by fighting poverty and exclusion among the most marginalised groups;     - Combat all forms of discrimination which lead to exclusion;     - Incorporate the fight against poverty and social exclusion into all relevant public policies, including economic and budgetary policies, and the Structural Fund programmes (especially the ESF).       Providing adequate and sustainable pensions       - Guarantee an adequate retirement income for all and access to pensions which allow people to maintain, to a reasonable degree, their living standard after retirement;     - Ensure the financial sustainability of public and private pension schemes, particularly by supporting a longer working life and active ageing, guaranteeing an appropriate and fair balance between contributions and benefits, and maintaining the security of funded and private schemes;     - Ensure that pension schemes are transparent and that people receive the information they need to prepare for retirement.       Ensuring accessible, high-quality and sustainable health care and long-term care       - Guarantee access for all to adequate health and long-term care, and ensure that the need for care does not lead to poverty and financial dependency;     - Promote quality of care and rational use of resources.      PROCEDURES AND WORKING ARRANGEMENTS FOR A STRENGTHENED OMC       Evaluation and reporting      The new common objectives will provide a basis for drawing up national social protection and inclusion strategies, entailing:      a common section assessing the social situation and presenting the overall strategic approach for modernising social protection and social inclusion policies;       three thematic plans covering social inclusion, pensions and health care. These plans should be forward-looking, with prioritised national objectives translating the common objectives into national plans.      The Commission will draw up a joint report (for adoption by itself and by the Council) on social protection and social inclusion, which will take stock of the progress made by the Member States and review the main trends.      Timetable for reporting and evaluation      The national strategies would normally cover a forward-looking period of three years. As regards the new Lisbon timetable, the first reports ought to be submitted in September 2006. The Member States will not be required to present national strategies in the intermediate ("light") years. They may, if they wish, report on any new initiatives or on progress with their actions.      Supporting more mutual learning      Exchanges of practice and mutual learning should be given more prominence and be better integrated with reporting and evaluation. The planned PROGRESS budget line will provide assistance for conducting such exchanges across the whole OMC spectrum.      Stakeholder involvement and governance      The strengthened OMC should redouble the focus on promoting good governance, transparency and stakeholder involvement:      For inclusion: promoting participation in decision-making, ensuring policy coordination between branches and levels of government;       For pensions: making pension systems understandable and giving people the information they need to prepare for retirement;       For health: establishing good coordination between the different elements of the system and giving good information to citizens.       Enhancing visibility      Improving the visibility of the OMC would contribute positively to the policy debates in the Member States. The planned lighter rhythm of reporting and evaluation may provide an opportunity to place greater emphasis on publicising the OMC through national seminars open to all.      Background      In so far as social protection and social inclusion policies are not incorporated into Community law, the mechanism introduced by the Lisbon European Council in March 2000 within the Union is called the open method of coordination (OMC). It allows the definition of common objectives and the comparison of good practices between Member States in three areas: social inclusion (since 2000), pension and retirement systems (since 2001) and the future of the health and long-term care sector (since 2004). Specifically, the OMC involves the setting of common general objectives, the drawing-up of national action plans and reports outlining the policies the Member States intend to conduct for achieving the common objectives, and the assessment of these plans and strategies in other joint reports by the Commission and the Council.     With a view to achieving more effective social policy coordination and better alignment with the Lisbon Strategy (particularly with the broad economic policy guidelines and the European employment strategy), a decision was taken in 2003 to streamline the OMC (see       Commission Communication of May 2003 on the streamlining of coordination in the field of social protection      ).     Continuing with the streamlining effort, the present Communication proposes a new set of common objectives for the three strands of the OMC along with the application of new procedures from 2006 onwards. The strengthened OMC should operate in parallel and in close interaction with the revised Lisbon Strategy, contributing to the growth and employment objectives at the same time as the Lisbon-related programmes contribute to the social cohesion objectives.

summary of   Council Decision 2002/358/EC on the EU’s approval of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the joint fulfilment of commitments thereunder   summary    what does this decision do  It gives the EU’s legal approval to the  Kyoto Protocol  — an agreement under the  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  (UNFCCC) — and confirmation that the EU and the 15 countries that were members at the time the legislation was adopted (the ‘EU-15’) would honour the commitments they made to an 8 % cut in their greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 levels for the EU as a whole.   key points    As the Kyoto Protocol allowed groups of countries to meet their targets jointly, the overall 8 % reduction for the EU and EU countries was broken down into legally binding national targets, tailored to the relative wealth of each country at the time.   The decision sets out emission limitations or reductions for the ‘EU-15’ between 2008 and 2012. These are:   the EU to reduce overall emission levels to 92 %,   8 countries to reduce emissions, to between 72 % (Luxembourg) and 94 % (Netherlands),   5 to be allowed to increase them, to between 104 % (Sweden) and 127 % (Portugal)   2 (France and Finland) to maintain them at existing levels (100 %).     Similar individual targets have been set for countries that joined the EU after the Kyoto Protocol was adopted — except for Cyprus and Malta, which have no targets.   The EU and the EU countries have met their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol’s first commitment period (2008-2012).   To bridge the gap between the end of the first Kyoto period and the start of a new global agreement in 2020, 37 developed countries and the EU agreed to a second period. The  arrangements for 2013-2020  were adopted at the Doha climate change conference in December 2012.   background    ‘Kyoto 1st commitment period (2008-12)’  on the European Commission's website.   from when does this decision apply  It entered into force on 2 May 2002.   act   Council Decision  2002/358/EC  of 25 April 2002 concerning the approval, on behalf of the European Community, of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the joint fulfilment of commitments thereunder (OJ L 130 of 15.5.2002, pp. 1–3)
summary of   Regulation (EU) No 346/2013 on European social entrepreneurship funds   what is the aim of the regulation  It introduces the  European social entrepreneurship fund  (  EuSEF  ) label which is designed to identify funds focusing on European social businesses, making it easier for them to attract investment.   key points    Social businesses address  social objectivesas their corporate aim  rather than simply maximising profit. It is a growth sector, representing 10 % of all European companies and employing over 11 million people. While they often receive public support,  private investments from funds that invest in social entrepreneurs are vital  for their success.   These funds face  2 problems  :   it can be  costly and difficult to set up  such funds and attract investors, especially cross-border investment;   it is  notalways easy for investors to identify such funds  or compare the advantages of different types.     To remove these barriers, the EU has adopted legislation creating a  label  for  European social entrepreneurship funds  , making it easier for investors to know the destination of their investments.   The  label  :   makes it easier for investors to  identify and choose E  u  SEFs  ;   helps social businesses through  easier access to finance  ; and   enables investment fund managers to  raise finance with less cost and complexity  .     Funds that market themselves using this label have to direct at  least 70 % of their investments to social businesses  .   In addition, they have to provide  key information to investors in a standardised way  . This information covers areas such as:   the fund’s social objectives;   the social businesses it invests in; and   how it assesses whether these businesses achieve their social goals.     Once a fund has provided the required information and meets some important conditions on its organisation and operation, it can gather investments from across the EU without incurring major costs.   In addition to the 70 % rule, a  fund manager  must  demonstrate good conduct  of the business and  effective systems and controls  , and  avoid any conflict of interest  . The funds are supervised by the national authorities in the country where they are based and the  label can be withdrawn  if they do not fulfil any of the essential conditions.   In 2014, the  European Commission  adopted an implementing regulation (Regulation (EU) No  593/2014  ) which deals with the notification of events related to the passport of the managers of qualifying social entrepreneurship funds and with aspects concerning the removal of a manager of a EuSEF from the register.   As one of the measures under the  Capital Markets Union  initiative, the EuSEF regulation is currently being revised in order to increase the take-up of social entrepreneurship funds. On 14 July 2016, the Commission submitted a  proposal  to the  European Parliament  and the  Council  to amend the EuSEF Regulation for adoption under the  ordinary legislative procedure  .   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 22 July 2013, except for those articles giving the Commission the power to adopt delegated acts which has applied from 15 May 2013.   background   For more information, see:    ‘Social entrepreneurship funds’  on the European Commission's website.
   Passenger car related taxes     Passenger car related taxes     This proposal for a directive provides for the restructuring of European Union (EU) countries’ passenger car related taxation systems with a view to improving the functioning of the internal market. It aims to remove the tax obstacles to permanently transferring passenger cars from one EU country to another. By restructuring the basis on which passenger cars are taxed, the proposed directive also aims to promote environmental sustainability in terms of carbon dioxide emissions.     PROPOSAL     Proposal for a Council Directive of 5 July 2005 on passenger car related taxes [       COM(2005) 261      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This proposal for a directive aims to improve the functioning of the internal market and reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars. By restructuring European Union (EU) countries’ systems for taxing passenger cars the proposal for a directive aims to remove fiscal obstacles to the free movement of passenger cars from one EU country to another.     Regarding taxes on passenger cars, the Commission proposes measures such as:      phasing out car registration taxes (RT) over a transitional period of five to ten years;       establishing a system for reimbursing registration taxes for passenger cars registered in one EU country and then exported or permanently transferred to another EU country;       introducing an element linked to CO2 emissions into the tax base of annual circulation tax (ACT) and registration taxes.       Registration taxes      Under the current situation, RTs can lead to double taxation in cases where citizens move their permanent residence from one EU country to another or when a second-hand car is brought in from another EU country. Since these taxes can therefore create obstacles to the free movement of citizens as well as lead to a fragmentation of the market for used cars, it is proposed to phase them out.     Gradually abolishing RT over a transitional period of five to ten years will give those EU countries which are currently applying high RTs sufficient time to restructure their tax system and will also give holders of used cars protection against any immediate loss of their commercial value.      Refunding registration taxes      The purpose of establishing a system for refunding some of the RTs charged when registering any passenger car which is to be exported or permanently transferred to another EU country is to avoid double taxation in the interim period until RTs will be phased out. Moreover, clear rules are established for the calculation of the residual value of the RT to be refunded in the above cases.      Minimum tax revenue in terms of CO2 emissions      A link between CO2 emissions and the tax bases for RT and ACT is introduced based on the CO2 emissions per kilometre of each passenger car.     The total tax revenue generated by the CO2-related element of the annual circulation and registration taxes should be at least:      25% on 31 December 2008;       50% on 31 December 2010.       Background      The fact that there are differing systems for taxing passenger cars in the EU results in tax obstacles (such as double taxation) and impedes the smooth functioning of the internal market. The purpose of the measures put forward in this proposal for a directive is to remove tax obstacles to the cross-border transfer of cars. The new structure approximates the systems for taxing passenger cars applied by the EU countries but does not harmonise taxation levels in EU countries or oblige them to introduce new taxes.     Use of the tax system to promote fuel-efficient cars is one of the three pillars of the strategy for reducing CO2 emissions adopted by the EU in 1995. The other two pillars are consumer information, achieved by means of labels showing a vehicle’s CO2 emissions, and a voluntary commitment by automobile manufacturers to reduce CO2 emissions.

The Commission finds that, despite the progress made on achieving the voluntary target of 140 g of CO2/km by 2008-09, the target of 120 g of CO2/km that the EU has set itself will not be achieved by 2012 without additional measures. In order to achieve this target, the Commission proposes mandatory reductions of CO2 emissions to 130 g of CO2/km by means of better engine technologies (to be achieved by the automobile manufacturers) and a further reduction of 10 g of CO2/km through other technological improvements (tyre pressure monitoring systems, more effective air-conditioning systems, etc.) and an increased use of biofuels. Furthermore, the Commission intends to promote the purchase of fuel-efficient vehicles, particularly by improving vehicle labelling and by introducing legislation that would enable car tax systems in the EU countries to take account of CO2 emissions.

summary of   Directive 2007/64/EC on payment services in the EU’s internal market   summary    what does this directive do   It lays down rules for payment services* such as credit transfers, direct debits and card payments.   These rules include information requirements for payment services providers, as well as rights and obligations linked to the use of payment services.   key points    Authorisation   An institution that offers payment services must obtain an authorisation to carry out its payment activities throughout the EU. Each EU country has a national body responsible for granting authorisations. The institution is authorised only if it has robust governance arrangements in place for its business and holds a certain amount of capital.   Information requirements   Payment services providers must provide a range of clear information to the users of their services.  Prior to a payment service, they have to communicate information related to   fees,   complaint procedures and   all charges payable in an easily understandable way.   After the execution of a payment transaction, they have to provide information to the payer, including:   the reference of the payment transaction and of the payee;   the payment amount;   the fees and commissions related to the transaction.   They have to communicate information to the payee once the transaction has taken place.  The law also lays down specific rules about the information that payment services providers have to give when transactions are covered by a contract governing the future execution of successive payment transactions.   Rights and obligations   A payment transaction in euros or in the currency of an EU country outside the euro area is executed within 1 working day.  Payment services providers are fully liable to payers for the correct execution of payment transactions. When a transaction is not executed or is defective, the payer’s payment services provider must correct it or refund the relevant amount to the payer. In the event of the misuse of a payment instrument by someone other than the payer, such as a credit card, the payer bears the losses up to a maximum amount of €150.  The law also lays down rules for refunds when payment transactions have been wrongly authorised by a payment services provider.   Repeal   Directive (EU)  2015/2366  repeals Directive 2007/64/EC with effect from 13 January 2018.   from when does the directive apply  It applies from 25 December 2007. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 1 November 2009.   background   Consumers need to be sure that the payments they make throughout the EU are easy, efficient and secure. To meet this objective, the EU has set up a common framework for payment services, which replaces EU countries’ national rules.   For more information, see the European Commission’s  Payment Services website  .   key term    * Payment services  : business activities that:   allow people to deposit or withdraw cash on or from a payment account, as well as the operation of that account;   execute payment transactions (e.g. standing orders, direct debits, etc.) both on payment accounts or by electronic means;   issue and/or receive payment instructions;   execute money remittance (transfers of money by foreign workers to persons in their home country).   act   Directive  2007/64/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 November 2007 on payment services in the internal market amending Directives 97/7/EC, 2002/65/EC, 2005/60/EC and 2006/48/EC and repealing Directive 97/5/EC (OJ L 319, 5.12.2007, pp. 1-36)  Subsequent amendments to Directive 2007/64/EC have been incorporated into the basic text.

   Flax and hemp grown for fibre     Flax and hemp grown for fibre     The common market organisation (CMO) for flax and hemp grown for fibre is designed to ensure effective processing of straw and the proper use of Community funds. To achieve this, it takes account of the special features of the various products and producing regions. The CMO for flax and hemp remains in force until 30 June 2008.     ACT     Council Regulation (EC) No       1673/2000      of 17 July 2000 on the common organisation of the markets in flax and hemp grown for fibre [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     From 1 July 2008, products falling within the scope of this Regulation will be covered by the       common organisation of agricultural markets      .     The CMO for flax and hemp provides for an intervention regime within the framework of the single market and rules on trade with third countries.      Scope      The products concerned are raw or processed - but not spun - flax and hemp, and flax and hemp tow and waste.      Aid scheme      Aid for processing flax and hemp straw into fibre is granted to authorised primary processors on the basis of the quantity of fibre obtained provided that the farmer concludes a contract for the purchase/sale of straw or undertakes to process the straw himself/herself. The aid is also paid where the farmer retains ownership of the straw during processing and proves that he/she is placing the fibre obtained on the market himself/herself.     For long flax fibre, the aid is EUR 160 per tonne of fibre for the 2007/08 marketing year. From the 2008/09 marketing year the aid is EUR 200 per tonne of fibre. For short flax fibre and hemp fibre containing not more than 7.5% impurities, the aid is EUR 90 for the 2007/08 marketing year, but up to the 2007/08 marketing year the Member States may grant aid for those products even where they contain a higher percentage of impurities.     The maximum guaranteed quantity is 80 878 tonnes per marketing year for long flax fibre and 147 265 tonnes per marketing year for short flax fibre and hemp fibre. These quantities are apportioned among the Member States. From the 2008/09 marketing year onwards, only the maximum guaranteed quantities for long flax fibre will continue to be applicable. Any additional production will be ineligible for the aid.     Where production and processing of fibre take place in two different countries, the quantity of product obtained will count against the national guaranteed quantity of the Member State in which harvesting took place.     Additional processing aid is allowed for areas under flax in the Netherlands and in specific areas of Belgium and France for the 2007/2008 marketing year. This aid is EUR 50 or 120 per hectare depending on the production area.      Trade with third countries      :     Imports of hemp are subject to the issue of a licence ensuring that:      the raw hemp and the seeds intended for sowing have a tetrahydrocannabinol content of 0.2% or less;       hemp seeds not intended for sowing are imported only by importers approved by the Member State.      Charges having an effect equivalent to customs duties and the application of quantitative restrictions or measures of equivalent effect are not allowed in trade with third countries.     Temporary safeguard measures may be taken if the Community market is likely to be disrupted as a result of imports or exports.      Other provisions      Save where the Regulation contains provisions to the contrary, the Treaty rules on state aid apply to flax and hemp grown for fibre.     In implementing the Regulation, the Commission is assisted by a Management Committee for Natural Fibres made up of representatives of the Member States.      Background      The first common market organisation for flax and hemp was introduced in 1970, by Regulation (EEC) No       1308/70      .     The major reform of the CAP in 2003 had a profound impact on the flax and hemp sector as regards land use and the grant of       regional aid and area payments for arable crops      . In 2006 Regulation (EC) No       953/2006      extended the aid for this sector beyond the periods originally provided for under the reform.     The present Regulation is repealed by Regulation (EC)       1234/2007      which sets up a single CMO for 21 sectors.

RELATED ACTS      Implementing rules       Commission Regulation (EC) No         507/2008        of 6 June 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1673/2000 on the common organisation of the markets in flax and hemp grown for fibre.       Reports       Report from the Commission to the Council on production trends in the various Member States and the impact of the reform of the common organisation of the market in flax and hemp grown for fibre on the outlets and economic viability of the sector [         COM(2003) 701        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      The Commission considers, on the basis of the information gathered, that the arrangements have had clear positive effects on the sector. It concludes, therefore, that no amendments should be made to the existing system of aid before the fuller analysis scheduled for 2005 has been carried out. The option open to Member States to derogate from the limit of 7.5% on impurities has been extended until 2005/06.      Evaluation of the common market organisation for flax and hemp, September 2005 (pdf)       (         FR        ).      This evaluation gauges the impact of the 2000 reform, taking account of the sector’s various outlets. As regards fibre production, Community aid has no impact on the overall competitiveness of the final product. According to the report, abolition of the current CMO aid system would not threaten the survival of the European flax and hemp sectors in the short term.The study concludes, however, that the principle of maintaining the aid is justified because a number of destabilising factors have contributed towards a shrinkage of the sector’s economy.

summary of   Directive 2013/29/EU — EU rules relating to pyrotechnic articles   what is the aim of this directive  It sets out the rules to achieve the  free movement  of  pyrotechnic articles   *   within the EU market  while seeking to ensure high levels of protection of health and safety, and of the environment.  It  revises  the existing rules on pyrotechnic articles (Directive  2007/23/EC  ) to align them with the so-called  New Legislative Framework  , a package of measures to improve  market surveillance  and the quality of  conformity assessments  .   key points   The directive lists the categories of pyrotechnic articles to which it applies by  type of use  .  Fireworks built by a manufacturer for his  own use  and  approved for use only  in the EU country in which the manufacturer is established and which  remain in that country  , are not covered.  It lays down the  essential safety requirements  that pyrotechnic articles must meet so as to be made available on the market. These are listed in the directive’s Annex I.  It sets out the  conformity assessment procedures,  where an  EU-type examination  is carried out, a  notified body  examines the technical design of an article, and verifies and attests that this design meets the requirements of the directive.  It sets  minimum age limits and other restrictions  on access to pyrotechnic articles:    Fireworks    F1 category: 12 years;   F2 category: 16 years;   F3 category: 18 years.      Theatrical pyrotechnic articles  : T1 category: 18 years.    Other pyrotechnic articles:  P1 category: 18 years.   Some pyrotechnic articles may only be made available to  people with a specialist knowledge  , for example, F4 category fireworks, fireworks for professional use, which present a high hazard.   EU countries may increase these age limits and may further restrict some pyrotechnic articles’ availability to the general public on grounds of public order, security, health and safety, and environmental protection.  All businesses and organisations in the supply and distribution chain must ensure that they only make available on the market those pyrotechnic articles that meet the requirements of this directive. The directive lays down the obligations of each party along this chain.   Manufacturers  have to indicate their name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and the postal address at which they can be contacted on the pyrotechnic article, or, where that is not possible, on the packaging or in a document accompanying each article. Contact details must be in a language easily understood both by end-users and market surveillance authorities.   Instructions  and  safety information  must be given in a language which can be  easily understood by consumers and other end-users  in the EU country in which the article is to be made available on the market.   Labelling  must be done in the official language(s) of the country in which the pyrotechnic article is made available. Such labelling must contain at least the minimum information required by the directive.  For  market surveillance  purposes, manufacturers draw up an  EU declaration of conformity  for each product in accordance with the model in the directive’s Annex III. This states that the product meets the essential safety requirements. By drawing up the EU declaration of conformity, the manufacturer assumes the legal responsibility for the compliance of the pyrotechnic article with the directive’s requirements.  Manufacturers must ensure that the labelling bears the  registration number  assigned to the product by the notified body that carries out the conformity assessment.   Importers  must ensure that they only place products that comply with this directive on the market. They need to ensure that:   the appropriate conformity assessment procedure has been carried out by the manufacturer;   the pyrotechnic article bears the CE conformity marking;   the labelling meets the requirements;   the documents drawn up by the manufacturer are available to the competent authorities upon request.   Both manufacturers and importers must keep records of the  registration numbers  of the articles they make available on the market. Implementing Directive  2014/58/EU  introduces a system for the traceability of pyrotechnic articles.  The directive requires EU countries to ensure that manufacturers, importers, distributors, retailers, etc. may only place pyrotechnic articles on the market on condition that they are  stored properly  and  used for their intended purpose,  so that theydo not place health and safety at risk.  EU countries must introduce rules on penalties to be applied where parties do not comply with the directive’s requirements. These rules may include  criminal penalties  for serious infringements.   from when does the directive apply  Most of the new rules contained in Directive 2013/29/EU have applied since 1 July 2015. They had to become law in the EU countries by 30 June 2015, while rules concerning new safety requirements for the most dangerous categories of pyrotechnic articles(categories P1, P2, T2 and F4) had to become law by 3 October 2013.   background   For more information, see:    Pyrotechnic articles  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Pyrotechnic articles:  articles containing explosive substances or an explosive mixture of substances designed to produce heat, light, sound, gas or smoke or a combination of such effects. Examples include fireworks, theatrical pyrotechnic articles, ignition devices and vehicle airbags.
summary of   Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/300 establishing a general plan for crisis management in the field of the safety of food and feed   what is the aim of the decision   This  implementing act  aims to  minimise the extent and impact of outbreaks of food or feed disease  on  public health  .   It establishes a  crisis management plan  to ensure the EU is ready to cope effectively if an outbreak does occur.   It repeals Decision  2004/478/EC  .   key points   The crisis management plan:   comes into effect if an  incident   *  demands closer contacts (‘  enhanced coordination  ’) between EU countries or, if more serious, the establishment of a  crisis unit  ;   sets out practical procedures, including a communication strategy, to prepare for, and manage, any outbreak requiring EU action;   applies to any food or feed incident posing a direct or indirect risk to public health, which cannot be prevented, eliminated or reduced by measures already in place.   Each EU country’s government, the  European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)  and the  European Commission  appoint one  crisis coordinator  to act as a  single contact point  . The crisis coordinators:   meet regularly, at least once a year;   present EU-wide initiatives;   share national contingency plans;   have clear general and communication tasks;   provide follow-up and evaluate how a crisis is handled.    Enhanced coordination  — the first level of EU response — is triggered when there is:   a  direct or indirect public health risk from food or feed  involving 2 or more EU countries; or   a serious possibility trade in food and feed in the EU could be affected; and there is:   a major health impact from the identified risk;   disagreement between EU governments on how to react;   difficulty in identifying the source of the risk.     In such cases, the Commission:   organises the regular crisis coordinators’ meetings;   links the Early Warning and Response System (set up under Decision 1082/2013/EU on  serious cross-border threats to health  ) with other EU-level alerts and information systems, including the  Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed  ;   ensures, with EU countries’ governments, the maintenance of a network of European and national laboratories which provide swift and high-quality analyses;   offers training, including simulation exercises, on crisis preparedness and  foodborne outbreak   *  investigation;   collects, monitors and analyses data on direct and indirect cross-border threats, from a range of European and international sources, including the EFSA and the  World Health Organisation  ;   draws up a 5-year plan to implement the general plan, updating it every 5 years.   The Commission may decide to step up the level of EU response and establish a  crisis unit  when:   2 or more countries identify a politically sensitive direct or indirect public health risk; and   a high number of deaths occur or could be expected; or   repeated incidents pose a risk to human health; or   biological or chemical terrorism or important radioactive contamination is suspected.     The  crisis unit  :   develops, coordinates and implements a crisis response strategy, including a communication plan;   coordinates, with the EFSA and other experts, the investigation tracing the products involved and their withdrawal;   contains national, Commission and EFSA crisis coordinators and representatives from other EU agencies, as appropriate;   continues to operate until the Commission considers the crisis is over or may be downgraded to enhanced coordination level.   All crisis coordinators, on the basis of a follow-upCommission  report  , meet to identify potential lessons learned and any necessary improvements required.  A  communication strategy  requires the Commission to coordinate  clear, targeted and effective information to the public  during an incident on the assessment and management of the risk. The information, at both national and European level, should be timely, sound and reliable.   from when does the decision apply  It has applied since 13 March 2019.   background   The EU operates on the principle that prevention is better than cure. It has in place a wide range of checks and standards to ensure the food produced and eaten is safe for human consumption.  However, crises, such as the BSE ‘mad cow’ outbreak in the 1990s, occasionally occur. To react quickly and effectively to such threats, it has put in place measures to avoid or minimise any threats to public health or the economy.  For more information, see:    Crisis preparedness and management  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Incident:  detection of a biological, chemical or physical hazard in food, feed or humans which could cause a public health risk.   Foodborne outbreak:  2 or more human cases of the same disease or infection probably linked to the same food source.
   Obligation of air carriers to communicate passenger data     Obligation of air carriers to communicate passenger data     This Directive requires air carriers to collect and transmit passenger data to the authorities of the Member State of destination responsible for control. Non-compliance may lead to fines being imposed and even, in the case of serious infringement, confiscation of the means of transport or withdrawal of the operating licence.     ACT     Council Directive       2004/82/EC      of 29 April 2004 on the obligation of carriers to communicate passenger data.     SUMMARY     According to this Directive, air carriers       *      are required to communicate information concerning their passengers travelling to a European Union (EU) border crossing       *      . This information is supplied, at the request of the authorities responsible for carrying out checks       *      on persons at the external borders       *      of the EU, to improve border control and to combat illegal immigration more effectively.     These data are forwarded to these authorities for passenger registration purposes. In principle they are transmitted electronically to these authorities.     Carriers are required to transmit the following information: number and type of travel document used, nationality, name and date of birth of the passenger, border crossing point of entry into the EU, departure and arrival time of the transportation, total number of passengers carried.     In principle, these data are deleted by these authorities within 24 hours of transmission, provided that the passengers have arrived within the territory of the Member States. The personal data are deleted by the carrier within 24 hours of arrival of the means of transport.     Member States must adopt dissuasive, effective and proportionate sanctions, should carriers fail to comply with this obligation. Such sanctions are applicable to carriers which, as a result of fault, have not transmitted data or have transmitted incomplete or false data. The maximum amount of these sanctions is not less than EUR 5000 and their minimum amount is not less than EUR 3000 for each journey.     Member States may also provide for other types of sanctions in the event of serious infringement of the communication requirement. These sanctions may consist of:      immobilisation, seizure and confiscation of the means of transport;       temporary suspension or even withdrawal of the carrier's operating licence.      Carriers may appeal against measures imposed against them. Member States adopt all the necessary measures for this right of appeal to be effective.      Background      This Directive was adopted following a request by the European Council of 25 and 26 March 2004, which met following the terrorist attacks in Madrid. The obligations provided for in this Directive are complementary to those laid down by Article 26 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, as supplemented by Council Directive       2001/51/EC      , concerning the       obligation of carriers to return third-country nationals      who are refused entry by the Member State of destination.       Key terms used in the act         Carrier: any natural or legal person whose occupation it is to provide passenger transport by air.         External borders: external borders of the Member States with third countries.         Border control: check carried out at a border exclusively on account of crossing that border.         Border crossing point: any crossing point authorised by the competent authorities for crossing external borders.

   Risk Capital Action Plan (RCAP)     Risk Capital Action Plan (RCAP)     The purpose of this communication is to promote coordinated action at Community level aimed at stimulating the expansion of risk-capital markets.     ACT     Commission communication of 31 March 1998 entitled "       Risk capital: a key to job creation in the European Union      " [SEC(1998) 552 final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The communication emphasises that risk-capital markets, which provide equity financing to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and high-growth companies, play a crucial role in business start-ups and their further development, and thus in job creation, within the European Union.     A comparison with the United States reveals that risk-capital markets are still significantly underdeveloped in the European Union. This is the case not only for the stock exchanges specialised in financing high-growth companies, but also for risk-capital investment at the start-up or development stage of new enterprises or in high-technology companies. Other noticeable differences include the degree to which US pension funds contribute to the provision of venture capital in the United States and the tendency there toward geographical concentration of operators with a stake in the entrepreneurial process (such as venture capitalists, researchers, entrepreneurs).     European entrepreneurs do not have adequate access to the capital they need to start and develop their businesses. Moreover, there is a lack of good investment opportunities for risk-capital investors. This lack of dynamism adversely affects the capacity of the EU to exploit its own innovative ideas and realise its job-creating potential.     The communication identifies six categories of barriers to the creation of risk-capital markets at European level:      capital markets in Member States are still extremely fragmented, reducing market capitalisation and liquidity;       institutional and regulatory barriers persist owing to the lack of a satisfactory regulatory framework at either European or national level. This is especially the case as regards the regulation of venture capital funds, institutional investors (insurance companies, pension funds), investment services, cross-border issues/listing and accounting rules;       the national tax systems of the Member States seem to penalise risk-capital investment. Firstly, revenue from direct participation in companies (dividends) tends to be taxed at higher rates than income resulting from capital invested free of risk in bonds and accounts deposits (interest). Secondly, it is important that taxation of capital gains should not be a brake either on investment or on the use of stock options as part of remuneration packages. Thirdly, there is a general lack of clarity as regards the tax regimes applicable to venture capital funds;       in the high-technology sector, there is an acute shortage both of start-up SMEs and of the investment opportunities that result from them. These deficiencies are accentuated by the rarity of networks or geographic concentrations of high-technology SMEs and by a legal and regulatory environment (intellectual property rules, administrative requirements for starting a company) scarcely conducive to innovation and business start-ups;       there are insufficient human resources (entrepreneurs and qualified experts) available for venture capital investment projects;       "cultural" factors, such as the attitude of investors to risk and the absence of an enterprise culture in schools and universities, hamper the formation of a new generation of European entrepreneurs.      The communication proposes an action plan to remove these barriers and so improve the conditions for the development of risk capital in the European Union. Some of the measures proposed (such as the reform of the European patent system) require a response at the level of the European Union, while others (e.g. the clarification of the tax environment for companies) should be handled by the Member States themselves.     RELATED ACTS      Commission Communication to the Council and the European Parliament on implementation of the risk capital action plan (RCAP) [         COM(2003) 654        - Not published in the Official Journal]      This communication reports on progress in the implementation of the RCAP for the year 2002 and, where possible, for the first three quarters of 2003. As it is the fifth and final report of its kind, the Commission also takes stock of progress over the RCAP implementation period as a whole (1998-2003). It reports considerable progress, with all political, as well as many technical, objectives attained.     Although the gap with the US remains, with investment there still double that in Europe, the disparity has been cut by half since 2000. While the European market is still fragmented on account of the persisting differences between Member States, the European risk capital industry is now much larger, more mature and more professional than in 1998. The regulatory framework has improved considerably, with tax issues remaining its weakest point.     Awareness by enterprises and public authorities of the strategic importance of this sector and the possibilities provided by this type of financing is now well enshrined in Europe. The RCAP has played a political role in supporting those directly or indirectly involved in risk capital activities. It has permeated other regional, national and Community policies and programmes. In order to keep up the momentum, the Commission will continue to follow the European risk capital markets closely. In 2004 it must analyse the areas where there are still inefficiencies with a view to putting forward recommendations and proposals, as appropriate, with the Lisbon 2010 deadline in mind.      Commission Communication to the Council and the European Parliament of 16 October 2002 on implementation of the risk capital action plan (RCAP) [         COM(2002) 563        - Not published in the Official Journal].      This communication is the fourth annual report on progress in the implementation of the RCAP since it was adopted in 1998. It reviews the progress made in 2001 and, on some points, in the first half of 2002, in the knowledge that the end of 2003 is the cut-off date for completion of the action plan.     The communication stresses that the European risk capital sector is going through a period of adjustment during which, certain areas, in particular, the operation, regulation and the liquidity of the stock markets, or the pan-European dimension of the risk capital market must be further rationalised. It also notes that modernisation of the regulatory framework has continued in a financial environment dominated by the successful introduction of euro notes and coins. Significant progress is being made towards the compulsory application of international accounting standards by 2005 and future legislation on supplementary pension funds. Moreover, it stresses that the Structural Funds have significantly increased their participation in the financing of risk capital.     In conclusion, the communication considers that the accompanying measures designed to develop risk capital in Europe have undergone profound and positive changes during the last four years. It feels that improvement of the environment for this type of investment should be a long-term objective, leaving aside any short-term consideration, and proposes that new measures should be considered for promoting risk capital in the following years.      Commission Communication to the Council and the European Parliament of 25 October 2001 on implementation of the risk capital action plan (RCAP) [         COM(2001) 605        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      This text reviews the progress made in 2000 and 2001 in implementing the risk capital action plan and takes stock at half-way point (the plan is due to be completed in 2003). While it welcomes the spectacular performance of the risk capital markets in Europe and the fact that all Member States have benefited from such growth, the Commission stresses that major disparities remain and the European market is still fragmented. The fall in stock markets, the downturn in economic growth and the events of 11 September 2001 in the United States have impacted negatively on the growth of the risk capital industry in Europe. Although progress in setting up a proper regulatory framework for risk capital has continued, many difficulties still subsist, such as the absence of a single patent and the discriminatory effect of certain tax rules. The introduction of the euro should make it easier to remove barriers to cross-border transactions. The development and promotion of European entrepreneurship has been pursued and important steps have been taken in the area of public funding: the Commission has for example clarified its policy towards state aid.     In conclusion, despite the progress achieved risk capital markets need to be strengthened much more before Europe can become a world leader in this field as advocated in Lisbon.      Commission Communication to the Council and the European Parliament of 20 October 1999 entitled "Risk capital: Implementation of the action plan - Proposals for moving forward" [         COM(1999) 493        - Not published in the Official Journal].      In the Communication, the Commission outlines the measures taken to remove obstacles to the rapid growth of risk capital since the adoption of the action plan in March 1998. It maintains that the process should be speeded up and developed and proposes taking stock regularly of progress made on the basis of a comparative evaluation system whereby the best practices are identified.      Commission communication of 11 May 1999 entitled "Implementing the framework for financial markets: Action plan" [         COM(1999) 232        - Not published in the Official Journal].      This action plan, presented at the request of the European Council, is based on the framework for action published by the Commission in October 1998 and on the deliberations of the Financial Services Policy Group. It contains a series of policy objectives and specific measures designed to improve the single market in financial services over the next five years. In particular, it proposes indicative priorities and a time-frame for adopting legislative and other measures with a view to attaining three strategic objectives:      a single wholesale financial services market;       open and secure retail markets;       state-of-the-art prudential rules and supervision.      The action plan also recommends that the Council and European Parliament adopt the proposed Directives on UCITS, distance selling of financial services and electronic money before the end of 1999.

   Progress with enlargement: Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia (2004)     Progress with enlargement: Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia (2004)     In view of the progress they have made, the Commission wishes to conclude negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania by the end of 2004, with a view to their joining the EU on 1 January 2007. However, the Commission advocates including a safeguard clause in their Accession Treaties allowing for the possibility of postponing their accession by one year.     Negotiations were to be started with Croatia in 2005 within the framework of an enhanced pre-accession strategy drawing on the conclusions of the Commission opinion on Croatia's candidacy. The Council decided, however, not to set a firm date for the opening of negotiations because it first wanted to see Croatia cooperating fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 6 November 2004: "Strategy Paper of the European Commission on progress in the enlargement process" [COM(2004) 657 final - Not published in the Official Journal]     SUMMARY      BULGARIA AND ROMANIA       Progress      The regular reports published every year by the Commission assess the candidate countries' capacity to meet all their obligations on accession. In the light of last year's reports, the Commission sums up the progress made by Bulgaria and Romania in terms of the       Copenhagen criteria      :      Political criteria: both countries satisfy the Copenhagen political criteria, although the Commission advocates continued efforts on reform of the public administration, the functioning of the judicial system and combating corruption.       Economic criteria: both countries fulfil the necessary conditions for establishing a viable market economy. Vigorous and efficient implementation of far-reaching structural reforms should enable both countries to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union.       Adoption of the Community         acquis        : in general, Bulgaria and Romania are meeting the commitments they made in the negotiations and have made good progress with adopting the         acquis        . The Commission concludes that both countries should have completed legislative transposition in time for accession, but urges them to develop adequate administrative and judicial capacity to implement the         acquis        .       The accession process      The Commission considers that the       accession negotiations      with both Bulgaria and Romania are going well. In spring 2004 a financing framework was defined and all the chapters were provisionally closed with Bulgaria in June 2004. In Romania's case three chapters remain to be negotiated: Competition, Environment and Justice and Home Affairs (JHA).     In view of the advanced state of negotiations, work began on drawing up the       Accession Treaty      for Bulgaria and Romania in July 2004. It will cover the entire       acquis      adopted and published as of 1 October 2004, the results of the accession negotiations and any transitional arrangements and will provide for adjustments of the       acquis      after enlargement. Once it has been approved by all the parties, the Accession Treaty will be the subject of a Commission opinion and endorsed by a European Parliament opinion. Lastly the Council will adopt its decision and all the Member States will then have to ratify the Treaty. The objective is for the Treaty to enter into force on 1 January 2007.     A       pre-accession strategy      , including substantial financial assistance, will allow the EU to support Bulgaria's and Romania's preparations for accession. From November 2005 the Commission will publish       annual monitoring reports      to ensure that Bulgaria and Romania are meeting the commitments they made in the negotiations. Any delay or problem will be promptly reported to the Council.     Three       safeguard clauses      (on the economy, the internal market and JHA) will be included in the Accession Treaty to allow for any serious shortcomings. A specific safeguard clause will also allow the accession date to be postponed to January 2008 if there is any serious risk that one of the candidates will be unable to fulfil the conditions of accession in time.      Conclusions and recommendations      In view of the progress made with implementing the Copenhagen criteria, the Commission is confident that the accession of Bulgaria and Romania can go ahead on 1 January 2007. It will do everything possible to meet the Council's objectives of completing negotiations in 2004 so that the Accession Treaty can be signed in 2005.     However, the Commission points out several areas in which there is an urgent need for improvement before accession. These are JHA for both countries and competition and the environment for Romania.     Bulgaria and Romania will not immediately adopt the euro upon accession. The removal of border controls will also be put off until some time after accession, and will be decided on separately by each Member State. However, both countries will become members of the European Economic Area as soon as they join the EU.      CROATIA      The Commission recommends extending to Croatia the enhanced pre-accession strategy for candidate countries. It points out that the European Council has decided to start negotiations with Croatia at the beginning of 2005 and is setting the framework for negotiations.      Pre-accession strategy      The review procedure, aimed at assessing candidate countries' progress towards membership, will start to be applied to Croatia as of 2005. Under this procedure the Commission will start issuing Regular Reports on Croatia from autumn 2005. Accession preparations will draw on the conclusions of the Commission opinion on Croatia's accession application.     As a candidate country Croatia will benefit from three pre-accession financial instruments from 1 January 2005:       Phare        : institution building and economic and social cohesion;        ISPA        : environment and transport;        SAPARD        : rural development.      The Commission also recommends creating a fourth       Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance      (IPA), from which Croatia will benefit from 2007.     The Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) which Croatia signed in 2001 should play an important role in trade matters and its structures will serve as an interface for monitoring Croatia's progress on alignment with the       acquis      . A framework agreement on participation in Community programmes and agencies should enter into force in the first half of 2005.      Negotiation framework      Under a decision of the Brussels European Council of June 2004 the Commission proposes that the framework for negotiations with Croatia should be based on the following principles:      compliance with the Copenhagen criteria;       the sustainability of political reforms and Croatia's fulfilment of its obligations in respect of regional cooperation with the other countries of former Yugoslavia, and other related international obligations such as those relating to the ICTY;       the Council's right to suspend negotiations by a qualified majority in the case of a serious breach of democracy, human rights, fundamental freedoms or the rule of law;       the principle of own merits, restricting the scope and duration of any transitional arrangements;       the establishment of a formal process for examination of the         acquis        ;       a procedure for recommending the opening of negotiations after each chapter of the         acquis        is closed;       the pace of negotiations to be determined by Croatia's transposition and proper implementation of the         acquis        ;       benchmarks for the provisional closure of each chapter before opening negotiations;       Croatia fulfilling its commitments under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement before the provisional closure of each chapter.       Conclusions and recommendations      The Commission particularly emphasises the need for ongoing political dialogue with Croatia to address sensitive issues such as minority rights, refugee return, judicial reform and combating corruption. It also stresses the need for cooperation with the ICTY and regional cooperation with the Western Balkans.      BACKGROUND      Bulgaria and Romania are an integral part of the enlargement process launched in 1997. Negotiations with both countries are on the point of being concluded. January 2007 is the target date for their accession.     On 21 February 2003 Croatia submitted its official application for accession to the EU. In June 2004 the Council officially recognised Croatia as an accession candidate. The Council and the Commission consider that accession negotiations should start at the beginning of 2005. Meanwhile, the principles, priorities and conditions of the European partnership with Croatia are set out in Council Decision       2004/648/EC      .

summary of   Directive 2009/119/EC obliging EU countries to maintain minimum stocks of crude oil and/or petroleum products   what is the aim of the directive   It aims to secure the European Union (EU) oil supply by requiring governments to keep a minimum level of crude oil and/or petroleum stocks.   It sets out procedures for releasing these if there is a serious shortage.   key points    EU countries must:   maintain total oil stocks equivalent to at least 90 days of average daily imports or 61 days of consumption — whichever is the higher;   ensure that stocks are readily available and accessible in the event of an emergency;   keep an updated register of their emergency stocks and send the data to the  European Commission  by 25 February every year;   maintain an updated register of specific stocks, such as motor and aviation gasoline, held within their territory and supply the Commission with the information within 15 days of receiving a request to do so;   send the Commission monthly summaries of the level of the commercial stocks held on their territory;   have contingency plans in place to respond to a major disruption in supply and be able to release some or all of their emergency stocks quickly and effectively;   allow companies and other entities that are required to hold oil stocks to delegate some of that responsibility, subject to certain conditions.     EU countries may set up central stockholding entities to acquire, maintain or sell stocks to comply with the directive.   Import and consumption levels used to calculate the minimum level of stocks are based on the previous year’s data.   An advisory oil and petroleum products coordination group helps the Commission analyse security of supply for the EU.   The Commission may, working with national authorities, review emergency preparedness procedures.   By 31 December 2015, the Commission had to review how the legislation was implemented.   from when does the directive apply  The directive has applied since 29 October 2009. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 31 December 2012.   background   For more information, see:    ‘EU oil stocks’  on the European Commission's website.
   Labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs     Labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs     Pre-packaged foodstuffs must comply with the rules on labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs. These rules are harmonised at European Union (EU) level to enable European consumers to make informed choices and to remove obstacles to the free circulation of foodstuffs and unequal conditions of competition.     ACT     Directive       2000/13/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs [       See amending act(s)      ].     SUMMARY     The Directive applies to pre-packaged foodstuffs to be delivered to the final consumer or to restaurants, hospitals, canteens and other similar mass caterers. It does not apply to products intended for export outside the European Union (EU).     The labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs must not:      mislead the consumer as to the foodstuff’s characteristics or effects;       attribute to a foodstuff (except for natural mineral waters and foodstuffs intended for special diets, which are covered by specific Community provisions) properties for the prevention, treatment or cure of a human illness.       COMPULSORY LABELLING PARTICULARS      The labelling of foodstuffs must include compulsory information. The particulars indicated on products must be easy to understand, visible, legible and indelible. Some of them must appear in the same field of vision.     The compulsory particulars include:       Name under which the product is sold        ;        List of ingredients        , which are listed in descending order of weight and designated by their specific name, subject to the derogations provided in Annexes I, II, III and III a). Ingredients which belong to more than one category are indicated according to their principal function.Under certain conditions, the listing of ingredients is not required for: Certain additives and enzymes are not considered as ingredients; this relates to those which are used as processing aids or those contained in an ingredient, which serve no technological function in the finished product;        Quantity of ingredients or categories of ingredients        expressed as a percentageThis requirement applies when an ingredient or a category of ingredients:        Net quantity        expressed in units of volume in the case of liquids and units of mass in the case of other products. However, there are specific provisions for foodstuffs sold by number and solid foodstuffs presented in a liquid medium;        Date of minimum durability        This date consists of the day, month and year, except in the case of foodstuffs that will not keep for more than three months (the day and month are sufficient), foodstuffs which will not keep for more than 18 months (the month and year are sufficient), and foodstuffs which will keep for more than 18 months (year is sufficient).The date shall be preceded by the words: ‘Best before …’ when the date includes an indication of the day or ‘Best before end …’ in other cases.The date of durability is not required for the following products: In the case of foodstuffs which are highly perishable, the date of minimum durability shall be replaced by the ‘use by’ date;       any         special storage conditions or conditions of use        ;       the         name or business name        and         address of the manufacturer or packager, or of a seller        established within the Community. However, Member States shall be authorised, in respect of butter produced in their territory, to require only an indication of the manufacturer, packager or seller;       the         place of origin or provenance        where failure to give such particulars might mislead the consumer;        instructions for use        should be included to enable appropriate use of the foodstuff;       indication of the         acquired alcoholic strength        of beverages containing more than 1.2 % by volume of alcohol.       DEROGATIONS AND SPECIAL PROVISIONS      The       European provisions applicable to specific foodstuffs      may authorise making particulars such as the list of ingredients and date of minimum durability optional. These provisions may provide for other compulsory particulars, provided this does not result in the purchaser being inadequately informed.     Special provisions apply to:       reusable glass bottles        and         small packaging items or containers        ;        pre-packaged foodstuffs.        Where pre-packaged foodstuffs are marketed at a stage prior to sale to the final consumer or are supplied to mass caterers for processing, the particulars need appear only on the commercial documents, provided that the name under which the product is sold, the date of minimum durability and the details of the manufacturer or packager appear on the outer packaging of the foodstuff;        foodstuffs offered for sale without pre-packaging and foodstuffs packaged on the sales premises        at the consumer’s request.       SAFEGUARD CLAUSE      The marketing of foodstuffs which comply with the Directive may be prohibited only in the case of non-harmonised national provisions that are justified on particular grounds, such as the protection of public health, prevention of fraud or the protection of industrial or commercial property.      COMMITTEE AND BACKGROUND      The implementation of the Directive is the responsibility of the European Commission, assisted by the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs (authorisation of national rules relating to certain foodstuffs and making provision for the listing of ingredients in addition to the name under which the product is sold, derogations in respect of compulsory particulars, description of an additive as an ingredient, changes to the annexes, adoption of transitional measures, etc.).     Directive 2000/13/EC replaces Council Directive       79/112/EEC      on the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs.

RELATED ACTS      Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 January 2008 on the provision of food information to consumers [         COM(2008) 40        - Not published in the Official Journal].      This Proposal for a Regular amalgamates Directives 2000/13/EC and 90/496/EEC on nutritional labelling, in order to improve levels of information and protection for European consumers.     The Proposal introduces new requirements in labelling. Mandatory information should include in particular the identity of goods, their composition and nutritional characteristics, their origin and conditions for safe use (durability, incidence and likelihood of danger to health). This information must be supplied in an honest way and should be easy for the consumer to read and understand. The minimum print size should be 3mm.     Nutritional labelling should include compulsory information such as:      energy value;       the quantity of some nutrients in the ingredients, lipids, saturated fatty acids, carbohydrates, as well as specific information on sugar and salt.      Moreover, consumers should be able to access adequate information, in particular when purchasing foodstuffs by Internet or other means of distance selling. The same goes for the presence of allergenic substances in foodstuffs, including for foodstuffs sold without packaging and meals served in restaurants.     The Member States may also adopt additional mandatory information requirements for specific categories of foodstuffs, in order to protect public health and safety and industrial and commercial property. The information envisaged must be notified as a proposal to the Commission, who may give a negative opinion.

summary of   Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013 establishing the Connecting Europe Facility   what is the aim of the regulation  It establishes the  Connecting Europe Facility (CEF)  which supports  projects of common interest  (that is, of interest to the EU as a whole) for  infrastructure  in the fields of:    transport  ;    telecommunications  ; and    energy  .   Its ultimate aim is to speed up investment in  trans-European networks  and to leverage funding from the public and private sectors.  It also sets out the amount of money to be made available from 2014 until 2020 and for which areas.  It has been amended several times, most recently:   in 2017, by Regulation (EU)  2017/2396  in the context of the extension of the  European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI)  (initially set up for 3 years) until the end of 2020; and   in 2018, by Regulation (EU, Euratom)  2018/1046  (the EU’s  Financial Regulation  ) which introduced a new article introducing a blending facility  *  .   key points    Helping to create sustainable economic growth   The  European Commission  sees creating efficient transport and energy infrastructure networks as a key way to boost growth and to strengthen confidence in the EU’s single market.  In particular, the CEF supports projects that aim to  develop and build new infrastructure and services  or upgrade existing infrastructure and services. One of its general objectives is to contribute to economic growth by developing  modern and high-performing trans-European networks  that take into account  expected future traffic flows  .   Sustainable development   Another general objective of the CEF is to help the EU reach its  sustainable development targets  (20% cut in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 levels, 20% increase in energy efficiency and raising the share of renewable energy to 20% by 2020).   Transport sector to be the biggest beneficiary   The total budget for the CEF from 2014 to 2020 comes to around  €33 billion  . It is broken down as follows:   around €26 billion for  transport  ;   around €1 billion for  telecommunications  ; and   around €6 billion on the  energy sector  .    Delegated acts   The Commission adopted 2  delegated acts  supplementing Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013 in relation to  transport funding priorities  :   Regulation (EU) No  275/2014  ; and   Regulation (EU)  2016/1649  .    2017 amendment of Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013   Regulation (EU) 2017/2396 in amending the EFSI regulation (Regulation (EU) 2015/1017) extends the EFSI’s duration of the EFSI and introduces some technical enhancements. In addition, it amends the CEF regulation by transferring part of the CEF’s unspent budget, as well as money from the revenues and repayments from the  CEF Debt Instrument  and from the 2020 European Fund for Energy, Climate Change & Infrastructure (‘  Marguerite Fund  ’ — a fund that invests in energy, renewables, transport and digital infrastructure) across to EFSI.   2018 amendment of Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013   Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 amended Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013 introducing a new article (Article 16a) offering the possibility to establish CEF blending facilities for which all actions contributing to projects of common interest would be eligible to receive funding. The overall contribution to CEF blending facilities from the  EU budget  cannot exceed 10% of the overall financial allocation to the CEF.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 1 January 2014.   background     Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) — Financial Instruments  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Blending facility:  a cooperation arrangement set up between the Commission and development or other public finance institutions with a view to combining non-repayable forms of support and/or financial instruments and/or budgetary guarantees from the budget and repayable forms of support from development or other public finance institutions, as well as from private-sector finance institutions and private-sector investors.
summary of   Regulation (EC) No 1552/2005 — statistics relating to vocational training in enterprises   what is the aim of this regulation  It lays down the rules and methods for collecting European statistics on  vocational training  in enterprises  *  .   key points    Data to be collected in enterprises   EU countries must collect data on the following:   enterprises’  training policy  and  training strategies to develop workforce skills  ;   management, organisation and forms of  continuing vocational training  in enterprises;   the  role of social partners  in ensuring all aspects of continuing vocational training in the workplace;    access  to continuing vocational training, its volume and content, especially in the context of economic activity and enterprise size;   specific measures of enterprises to  improve their workforce’s skills in information and communication technologie  s;   chances for employees in  small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)  to access continuing vocational training and to  acquire new skills,  and specific SME needs in the provision of training;   the  effects of public measures  on this form of training in enterprises;    equal opportunities  to access training in enterprises for all employees (and with respect to gender and specific age-groups in particular);   specific measures for people at a  disadvantage in the labour market,  for example, older people and people from minorities;   measures geared to different  types of employment contract  ;   expenditure on continuing vocational training:  funding levels and funding resources  , incentives for continuing vocational training; and    evaluation and monitoring procedures  of enterprises as regards continuing vocational training.   As regards,  initial vocational training in the workplace  , EU countries should collect data on:   participants in training of this type; and   total expenditure on training of this type.    Scope   The statistics cover training in enterprises involved in economic activities falling into sections B to N and R to S of the EU’s NACE classification  *  .   Statistical units   As a general rule, data are gathered only in relation to enterprises employing 10 or more people.   Data sources   EU countries may collect the data by means of surveys in enterprises or a combination of surveys in enterprises and other sources, in order to minimise the burden on respondents and keep administration simple.  EU countries lay down the procedures for enterprises to reply to the survey by the prescribed deadlines. Other sources of data may be used where deemed appropriate in terms of timeliness and relevance.   Survey characteristics and approach   EU countries must ensure that the data they transmit accurately reflect the structure of the population of the statistical units. The survey must be conducted in such a way as to permit a breakdown of the results at EU level of at least the following categories:   economic activities   size of enterprise.   The  European Commission  (  Eurostat  ) decides on the sampling requirements, the sample sizes to meet those requirements and the detailed specifications of the NACE and size categories into which the results can be broken down. The Commission also decides on the specific data to be collected with respect to training  *  and non-training enterprises  *  and to the different forms of vocational training.   Quality control   EU countries are responsible for ensuring the quality of the data they transmit to Eurostat. After each reference period of 1 calendar year, they must, within 21 months, submit a quality report to Eurostat containing all the information and data requested. The report should also mention whether there have been any breaches in the methodological requirements. On the basis of these reports, Eurostat assesses the quality of the data transmitted in order to ensure its comparability.   Periodicity   EU countries must collect the data every 5 years.   Transmission of data   EU countries send the individual data on enterprises to Eurostat in accordance with the EU legislation on data transmission, subject to statistical confidentiality, as set out in Regulation (EC) No  223/2009  . They must ensure that the data sent do not permit the direct identification of the statistical units. Transmission is in an electronic form and in accordance with specifications agreed by the  European Statistical System Committee  , a committee that assists and advises Eurostat comprising representatives from EU countries and chaired by the Commission .  EU countries must transmit the complete and correct data no later than 18 months after the end of each reference year.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 20 October 2005.   background   For more information, see:    Vocational education and training statistics  (  Eurostat  )    Continuing vocational training survey  (  Eurostat  ).   key terms    Enterprise:  the statistical unit used by Eurostat for observing and analysing the EU’s production system.   NACE classification:  abbreviation for the EU’s classification of economic activities, from the French  Nomenclature statistique des activités économiques  .   Training enterprises:  enterprises covered by the sampling that supply training services.   Non-training enterprises:  enterprises covered by the sampling but whose business is not to supply training services.
summary of   Directive (EU) 2019/1024 on open data and the reuse of public-sector information   what is the aim of the directive   It lays down the legal framework for the reuse  *  of public-sector information such as geographical, land registry, statistical or legal information held by public-sector bodies  *  or public undertakings  *  , and of publicly funded research data.   It aims to boost the socioeconomic potential of public-sector information, e.g. by making it more easily available for start-ups and  small and medium-sized enterprises  , by increasing the supply of dynamic data  *  and of datasets with a particularly high economic impact, and by promoting competition and transparency in the information market.   It is part of a package of measures designed to reinforce the EU’s data economy, including the development of artificial intelligence.   Also referred to as the ‘open data directive’, it  recasts  Directive  2003/98/EC  by repealing it by 17 July 2021.   key points   The recasted directive is based on the general principle that public and publicly funded data should be reusable for commercial or non-commercial purposes.   Open data   The directive promotes the use of open data (data presented in open formats  *  that one can use freely and share for any purpose). Public-sector bodies and public undertakings must make their documents available in any pre-existing format or language and, where appropriate, by electronic means in formats that are open, machine readable, accessible, findable and reusable, complete with their metadata.   Practical arrangements for reuse    Public-sector bodies must, through electronic means where appropriate, process requests for document reuse, making them available within a reasonable time.   At the same time, they should make necessary arrangements to facilitate the online search and discovery of the documents they keep.   EU countries must also facilitate effective reuse of documents, in particular by supplying information on the rights outlined in the directive and by offering assistance and guidance.    Dynamic and real-time data   Dynamic data must be made available for reuse immediately on collection via an application programming interface (API) and, where relevant, as a bulk download.   Research data    EU countries must adopt policies and take action to make publicly funded research data openly available, following the principle of ‘open by default’ and support the dissemination of research data that are findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (the ‘FAIR’ principle).   Concerns relating to intellectual property rights, personal data protection and confidentiality, security and legitimate commercial interests must be taken into account in accordance with the principle of ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’.   Publicly funded research data can be reused for commercial or non-commercial purposes in cases where they are already made publicly available via institutional or subject-based repository.    Fair trading and non-discrimination    The reuse of documents is open to everyone in the market and any applicable reuse conditions should be non-discriminatory.   As a general rule, arrangements between public-sector bodies or public undertakings holding the documents and third parties cannot grant exclusive rights.   In narrowly defined cases where the directive allows for the conclusion of such arrangements, their validity is subject to regular review and special transparency requirements apply.    High value datasets   The  European Commission  is given the possibility to adopt a list of high-value datasets which should be made available in machine-readable formats and free of charge through APIs. The datasets will be selected from within 6 thematic categories set out in Annex I:   geospatial;   earth observation and environment;   meteorological;   statistics;   companies and company ownership; and   mobility.   New thematic categories may be added by the Commission, by way of a  delegated act  .   Charges    The reuse of documents should be free of charge. However, marginal costs incurred to reproduce and disseminate documents, anonymise personal data and protect commercially confidential information may be recovered.   By way of exception, cultural institutions, public undertakings and some public-sector bodies that fulfil the requirements set out in Article 6(2) may charge beyond the default principle in order to recover the eligible costs.    Exceptions   The directive does not apply to:   documents for which third parties hold intellectual property rights;   documents whose access is excluded or restricted on the virtue of a national access regime or on the grounds of sensitive critical infrastructure protection;   documents whose supply falls outside the scope of the public task of a public-sector body or outside the scope of provision of services in the general interest of a public undertaking;   documents related to the activities of a public undertaking directly exposed to competition and therefore not subject to procurement rules under Article 34 of Directive  2014/25/EU  ;   other documents referred to in Article 1(2) of the directive.   from when does the directive apply  It has been in force since 16 July 2019. Directive (EU) 2019/1024  recasts  and replaces Directive  2003/98/EC  (and its subsequent amendments) as of 17 July 2021. It has to become national law in the EU countries by the same date.   background   For more information, see:    Digital single market  (  European Commission  )    Open access  (  European Commission  )    Open data  (  European Commission  )    Non-legislative measures to facilitate reuse  (  European Commission  )    EU Open Data Portal  .   key terms    Reuse:  the use by persons or legal entities of documents held by public-sector bodies or public undertakings.   Public-sector body:  means the state, regional or local authorities, bodies governed by public law or associations formed by such authorities or bodies governed by public law.   Public undertaking:  means any undertaking over which public-sector bodies have a dominant influence through ownership, financial participation therein, or the rules which govern it; these include those acting as  public passenger road or rail transport operators  ,  air carriers  and  EU shipowners fulfilling public-service obligations  .   Dynamic data:  means documents in a digital form, subject to frequent or real-time updates due to their volatility or rapid obsolescence; typically data generated by sensors.   Open format:  a file format that is platform-independent and made available to the public without any restriction that impedes the re-use of documents.
   Iceland – Competition     Iceland – Competition     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM(2011) 666      final – SEC(2011) 1202 final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The       2011 Report      notes the high level of alignment and implementation of the European Union (EU)       acquis      in Iceland which is largely due to the country’s membership of the       European Economic Area      (EEA).      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission’s words)      The legislation on competition covers both anti-trust and state aid control policies. It includes rules and procedures for fighting anti-competitive behaviour by companies (restrictive agreements between undertakings and abuse of dominant position), monitoring mergers and for preventing governments from granting state aid which distorts competition in the internal market. Generally, the competition rules are directly applicable throughout the Union, and Member States must cooperate fully with the Commission in the enforcement of these rules.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      In the field of       competition      , Icelandic legislation is already largely aligned with the European provisions and is implemented effectively.

It also aims to strengthen the European industrial and technological base, in the field of defence, to create a competitive European defence equipment market and to promote research.     ACT     Council Joint Action       2004/551/CFSP      of 12 July 2004 on the establishment of the European Defence Agency.     SUMMARY     The mission of the European Defence Agency is to support the Council and the Member States in their efforts to improve the European Union’s (EU) defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).     All the EU Member States except Denmark participate in the Agency (under Article       5      of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Denmark does not participate in the formulation and implementation of EU decisions and actions which have defence implications). The Agency has its headquarters in Brussels.     The Agency acts under the authority and the political supervision of the Council. Each year, the Council issues guidelines for the work of the Agency, notably with regard to its work programme and the financial framework of the Agency. The Agency reports regularly to the Council on its activities.      Policy areas      The main tasks of the Agency are:       to develop defence capabilities in the field of crisis management.        The Agency identifies the EU’s future defence capability requirements, coordinates the implementation of the European Capabilities Action Plan and the harmonisation of military requirements, proposes collaborative activities in the operational domain and provides appraisals on financial priorities;        to promote and enhance European armaments cooperation.        The Agency proposes new multilateral cooperative projects, coordinates existing programmes and manages specific programmes;        to strengthen the industrial and technological base in the field of defence and to create a competitive European defence equipment market.        The Agency develops relevant policies and strategies in consultation with the Commission and industry, and develops and harmonises relevant rules and regulations;        to enhance the effectiveness of European defence research and technology.        The Agency promotes and coordinates research aimed at fulfilling future defence capability requirements, in liaison with the Commission.       Organisation      The Agency has legal personality. Its bodies include the Head of the Agency, the Steering Board and the Chief Executive:      the         High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy        . S/he is responsible for the Agency's overall organisation and functioning. S/he also ensures that the guidelines issued by the Council and the decisions of the Steering Board are implemented by the Chief Executive, who reports to him;       the Steering Board is the Agency’s decision-making body. It is composed of one delegate from each participating Member State and one representative from the Commission. It holds at least two meetings each year at the level of Ministers of Defence. It may also meet in specific compositions (for example, at the level of National Defence Research Directors, National Armaments Directors, etc.). The Head of the Agency convenes and chairs the Steering Board’s meetings;       the Agency’s Chief Executive is appointed by the Steering Board on a proposal from the Head of the Agency for a period of three years, which may be extended for two years. The Chief Executive is the head of the Agency’s staff and is responsible for supervising and coordinating the functional units. Furthermore, the Head of the Agency is assisted by two deputies who are also appointed by the Steering Board in accordance with the same procedures.      The Commission is a member of the Steering Board without voting rights and is fully associated with the work of the Agency. The Commission, on behalf of the EU, may also participate in projects or programmes of the Agency.      Ad hoc projects      The Agency offers Member States the option to develop ad hoc projects relating to a specific subject and which bring together only interested Member States. Furthermore, the Chief Executive may authorise third parties to participate in the ad hoc projects. S/he establishes the modalities for cooperation between the Agency and third parties.      Financial rules      The financial provisions applicable to the Agency’s general budget are adopted by the Council, acting unanimously. Revenue consists of miscellaneous revenue and contributions payable by the Member States participating in the Agency.     The Steering Board, on a proposal from the Chief Executive or a Member State, may decide that the Agency may be entrusted by Member States, on a contractual basis, with the administrative and financial management of certain activities within its remit. The Steering Committee may also authorise the Agency to conclude contracts on behalf of certain Member States.      Relations with organisations or third countries      As part of its work programme, the Agency may establish cooperation with third countries. It may also collaborate with international organisations such as the       North Atlantic Treaty Organisation      (NATO) or the       Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation      (OCCAR). Cooperation with organisations or third countries relates in particular to:      the relations between the Agency and the third party;       provisions for consultation on subjects related to the Agency’s work;       security matters.       Context      The European Defence Agency was established on the basis of Article       42      , Paragraph 3, of the Treaty on European Union. Its missions are detailed in Article       45      of the TEU. The European Agency constitutes a fundamental element of the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy. It offers a legal and institutional framework for cooperation between the Member States in the field of defence.

   Human rights and relations in the Mediterranean     Human rights and relations in the Mediterranean     The Commission is making recommendations for bringing about a stable democratic environment and full enjoyment of human rights in the Mediterranean partner countries of the European Union (EU).     ACT     Communication of 21 May 2003 from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament "Reinvigorating EU actions on Human Rights and democratisation with Mediterranean partners. Strategic guidelines" [       COM(2003) 294      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     In this communication the European Commission makes ten recommendations for enhancing political dialogue and financial cooperation on human rights between the EU and its partners of the Mediterranean region (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia and the Palestinian Authority). These recommendations will be implemented at three interrelated levels:      through political dialogue and financial aid;       through the regional aid given to the         MEDA programme        and the         European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights        (EIDHR); and       at regional level.       The ten recommendations      The EU should ensure that the issues of human rights and democracy are systematically included in all institutionalised bilateral dialogues with Mediterranean partners. It should explore with its partners the possibility of setting up technical sub-groups (below the political level) to address these issues. More cooperation would also be desirable on matters such as legal reforms, the regulatory frameworks for civil society and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), freedom of speech and association and women's rights.     To promote a regular, in-depth dialogue on human rights and democratisation in the region the Union should ensure that more people know about the key human rights issues and available documentation in each of the Mediterranean countries. Standard methods of analysis and regularly updated data should be used to produce fact sheets on the situation in each of the partner countries.     The Commission should seek to ensure greater cooperation between its Delegations in Mediterranean countries and the Member States' embassies in the same countries. The human rights related issues of the MEDA and EIDHR programmes should be handled by experts. A further aim of such cooperation should be the implementation of UN human rights resolutions.     Workshops on human rights issues should be organised in cooperation with civil society and the national authorities of the Mediterranean countries. Such workshops would provide the EU with local knowledge, which it could use in identifying projects for implementation under EIDHR, and with a platform for promoting its policies on human rights, democratisation and the rule of law. The workshops would also help those engaged in Mediterranean civil society affairs to coordinate and plan their activities more effectively.     National action plans on human rights (drawn up for the MEDA programme) should take account of the situation in the country concerned, in particular its human rights legislation. The plans should set out the objectives and the financial and technical assistance needed. They should encourage the Mediterranean partner countries to accede to international human rights conventions and promote cooperation between the state and civil society.     Regional human rights action plans should be established whenever two or more partner countries wish to cooperate more closely on this issue. Their plans could, for instance, focus on women's rights or co-operation in the field of justice. They could also strengthen contacts with regional bodies such as the Arab League.     Starting in 2005, the human rights and democracy dimensions should be given more prominence in national indicative programmes and country strategy papers drawn up for the MEDA programme. Extra funds will be provided for this objective.     Also starting in 2005, human rights, democracy and the involvement of civil society should play a bigger part in the regional indicative programme and regional strategy applied under MEDA.     The EIDHR's role in the Mediterranean should be modified to include helping to build up the capacity of civil society in the region to engage in matters such as freedom of association and speech, defence/advocacy of the rights of specific groups, good governance and fighting corruption. The MEDA and EIDHR programmes should complement each other more than they do at present.     Synergies between existing instruments created to observe and assist in elections (political dialogue, MEDA, EIDHR) should also be fully exploited to improve the framework within which elections are held in the region's different countries.      The human rights situation in the Mediterranean      This Communication summarises the UNDP Arab Human Development Report for 2002. The report's main conclusions are:      deficits in governance (in connection with freedoms, marginalisation of women, preventing their access to knowledge) hamper the full development of democracy and respect of human rights;       discrimination against women hampers economic and social development;       the judicial system is not independent enough;       NGOs active in the civil and political spheres are weak and are prevented from networking internationally;       access to education is uneven and ill-adapted to the requirements of the modern economy;       authoritarianism and poor economic and social performance favour extremist political movements.      Although most of the countries in the region have signed up to the most important international instruments on human rights, this is not reflected in the situation on the ground since the countries do not comply with these international standards.      Context: European Union measures in the Mediterranean region      The Commission communication entitled "On the       EU's Role in Promoting Human Rights      and Democratisation in Third Countries" establishes a human rights strategy for application in the Union's external affairs. The aim of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership agreements concluded between the European Union and each of the region's countries is to establish an area of peace and stability founded on the principles of human rights and democracy. Similarly, the       Action Plan agreed at the Valencia conference      reaffirmed the commitment of all the parties to human rights, democracy and the rule of law in this region, whilst the association agreements concluded or under negotiation with the Mediterranean countries include the condition of engaging in a political dialogue covering, inter alia, issues of human rights and democracy. The Union's operational cooperation instruments for human rights in the Mediterranean are the MEDA programme, which has been up and running since 1996, and the EIDHR which was set up in 1994.

   A single market for 21st century Europe     A single market for 21st century Europe     The single market for the 21st century can be even more integrated, open and competitive. Its potential should be tapped more effectively through further development of knowledge and innovation and the social and environmental dimensions, especially to respond to globalisation. Its optimisation must also be results-oriented, which calls for the definition of a new approach to evaluation and achievement. The single market will in this way offer greater choice for consumers and opportunities for businesses.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 20 November 2007 entitled: "A single market for 21st century Europe" [       COM(2007) 724      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The single market is beneficial for consumers and businesses. It has supported job creation and stimulated growth, competitiveness and innovation. The single market has also been essential for the smooth functioning of the economic and monetary policies of the European Union (EU). However, it still has untapped potential.      HARNESSING THE POTENTIAL      The Commission proposes a single market for the 21st century which is strong, innovative and competitive. Building on its existing strong foundations, the single market must concentrate on key areas with potential added value in order to face up to new challenges.      Consumers and businesses      The single market needs to deliver better results and benefits to respond to the expectations and concerns of consumers and businesses. The guarantee of high standards has enabled       consumer      protection to be ensured in terms of choice and quality of goods, prices, rights, fighting unfair commercial practices and abuse of dominant positions, etc. Nevertheless, the single market can offer more in key sectors of the daily life of consumers, such as energy or telecommunications, and sectors which are fragmented or typified by a lack of effective competition.     The safety and quality of goods and services and market surveillance also need to be strengthened. Food safety, pharmaceuticals and retail financial services are areas in which consumers must be educated and empowered in order to derive full benefit from the single market. In this respect, consumer rights, and especially contractual rights, and redress should be re-examined to move towards a simple, comprehensive protective framework.     In addition,       small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)      are not integrated in the single market in the same way as large enterprises. Their participation is impeded mainly by tax fragmentation and language, cultural and consumer barriers. The initiative of the       Small Business Act      , based on the principle of "think small first", and improvement of the tax environment should provide an appropriate response to this problem.      Coping with globalisation      In a constantly changing international context, the single market presents many advantages in terms of innovation, competitiveness and choice, whilst respecting labour, health, safety and environmental standards. Through its nature, it has attracted foreign investments and firms.     The EU must continue this process to cope with globalisation, concentrating on the pillars identified in the Communication "       Global Europe competing in the world      ", i.e.:      the trade and competition policy instruments which guarantee a competitive space by responding to foreign subsidies and other unfair practices;       promotion of cooperation on multilateral and bilateral norms. The EU must take inspiration from international standards and its own standards must serve as a world reference, ensuring it a leading role, especially if it speaks with one voice;       ensuring that the benefits of market openness reach European citizens, especially in terms of choice and price, but also by following up on trade agreements.       Making knowledge and innovation the "fifth freedom"      The single market, which was originally based on primary products and manufactured goods, has to provide for the greater integration of services, which are assuming a growing role in a knowledge-based economy. In this way, it must tap the potential offered by the new technologies for the benefit of a "fifth freedom", i.e. free movement of knowledge and innovation.     The       Services Directive      is the lynchpin of this process. Nevertheless, the removal of barriers and strengthening of competition must be continued to offer more choice at lower prices to consumers and to boost innovation. Initiatives have been taken along these lines, especially with regard to the network industries (energy, postal services, transport, telecommunications, etc.). Information and communication technologies (ICT) are also an asset for the development of interoperable services in the context of the "e-Internal Market" (electronic invoicing, online public procurement and electronic customs), without creating new "e-barriers".     The mobility of workers, researchers and students must be guaranteed to promote knowledge-sharing. The 7th Framework Research and Development Programme (       7th FRDP      ) and the plan to introduce a "researcher passport" form the foundations of mobility and the development of research networks within the       European Research Area      (ERA).      Social and environmental dimension      Market opening has social and environmental impacts. The Commission will improve its impact assessments to anticipate market changes more effectively.     The development of the single market goes hand in hand with the European social agenda. Economic and social cohesion, based on the Structural Funds, allows citizens and businesses to be empowered and the benefits of the market to be spread to all regions of the EU. In this respect, the "       European Grouping for Territorial Cooperation      " (EGTC) offers new possibilities for cross-border cooperation in areas such as health, environment and infrastructures.     Workers’ mobility receives further support under the Job Mobility Action Plan. However, this must respect the fundamental rights of workers, including equal opportunities. The European Works Council will be adapted along these lines.     The development of "eco-industry" (pharmaceuticals or car manufacturing) contributes to the environmental dimension of the single market. Further investments are still needed, especially to contribute to fighting climate change.      DELIVERING RESULTS      An enlarged, diversified EU depends more than ever on the single market working well. The EU must concentrate on       the evidence and the impact      of the markets, giving priority to where markets do not deliver and where there are maximum chances of improvement. Market monitoring will be stepped up to determine the reasons for market failures and their potential on the basis of competition sector inquiries, lead markets and joint technology initiatives. The consumer scoreboard, which will be integrated into the Single Market Scoreboard from 2009, will provide additional information on the performances of these markets from the point of view of consumers and economic and social requirements.     Simple, appropriate tools will allow the       single market to be more targeted and better enforced      , without ending up with more regulations. Recourse to existing instruments and procedures under the various policies must be rationalised to achieve an optimum result. This also applies to the tools for the evaluation and implementation of Community legislation. The Commission will reconsider ineffective or superseded Community interventions.     All levels of governance, authorities and stakeholders must be involved on the basis of greater       decentralisation      , fostering ownership and mutual trust in the context of new working relationships and approaches. The       networks      , which could be based on "single market centres", are essential in this respect to ensure enforcement of Community legislation and cooperation, promoting exchanges of experience and good practices.      Communication      and       access to information      form the basis for transparency and knowledge of the Community rules. Member States are responsible for this. Achievement of these objectives will be based on the "single market ambassadors" pilot project (prominent persons in business and trade), a "one-stop shop" for the various services available to citizens and businesses (       Europe Direct      , Your Europe,       SOLVIT      , Citizens' Signpost Service,       EURES      , the new integrated business support network, etc.), as well as a Single Market Scoreboard adapted to allow better evaluation of performance.

summary of   Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 establishing, as part of the Internal Security Fund, the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa policy   what is the aim of the regulation  The regulation, known as the  ISF-Borders  and Visa Regulation, creates a funding instrument and lays down the objectives, the budget and procedures for implementing the eligible actions for the period 2014-2020.  The general objective of the instrument is to contribute to a high level of security in the EU while facilitating legitimate travel by ensuring the efficient management of the EU’s external borders and the effective processing of visas for the   Schengen area   (a border-free area comprising 22 EU countries and 4 associated countries — Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland).   key points   The ISF-Borders Fund aims to support:   the  common visa policy  to make legitimate travel easier by ensuring a high-quality service for visa applicants and equal treatment of nationals from outside the Schengen area, as well as to tackle illegal migration;    integrated border management  , including the use of common standards and information exchange between Schengen countries and with the  European Border and Coast Guard Agency  (EBCG agency, commonly referred to as  Frontex  ) to ensure;   a high level of control and protection of the external borders;   smooth crossing of the external borders in conformity with the Schengen  acquis  ; and   guaranteeing access to international protection for those needing it.     The instrument funds  actions  to:    strengthen external border checks  to monitor the crossing of external borders;   gradually establish an  integrated management system for external borders  , based on solidarity and responsibility, through for example;   external border surveillance systems; and   cooperation (including in the maritime border area) between border guards, customs, migration, asylum and law enforcement authorities;     promote the  common policy on visas  and other short-stay residence permits and consular cooperation mechanisms;    set up and run IT systems  supporting the common visa policy and border control, and improve awareness of the situation at external borders;   prevent and tackle  illegal immigration  in cooperation with non-EU countries.   Examples of  eligible actions  include:   infrastructures, IT systems and operating equipment, including means of transport, for border control and processing of visa applications;   studies, training and pilot projects on operational standards and best practices in the field;   actions relating to operational cooperation between EU and non EU-countries, including joint operations;   The implementation of the fund is mainly entrusted to the participating 26 EU countries (all EU countries, except Ireland and UK) and the 4 Schengen Associated countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland). The  national programmes  define the funding priorities by addressing the fund’s objectives.  The allocation of resources is based on a number of criteria relating to the type of external border (maritime, land and international airports), taking into account the travel flows and the level of risks and threats. The allocation of funds to specific objectives under the national programmes relate to the challenges and needs of participating countries.  A table setting out the amounts constituting the basis for participating countries’ national programmes is included in the regulation’s annex I. During the implementation period, such amounts have increased following the allocation of additional funds to national programmes in the framework of the mid-term review conducted in 2018, and specifically for the development of IT systems and for the implementation of the specific actions.  A part of the fund is managed centrally by the Commission in the form of  Union actions  which includes assistance to address urgent and specific needs in the event of an emergency situation (  emergency assistance  ).  The fund is complemented by the instrument for financial support for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management (  ISF-Police  Fund), set up by Regulation (EU) No 513/2014.   Budget   The total initial allocation for ISF-Borders and Visa (2014-20) was €2.76 billion (in current prices).   Implementation   The so-called ‘Horizontal Regulation’ (Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 — see  relevant summary  ) contains the general rules and procedures for implementing this instrument.   Extension of the fund to the Schengen associated countries   Agreements have been negotiated between the EU and the 4 Schengen Associated Countries allowing their participation in the ISF-Borders and Visa.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 1 January 2014.   background   For more information, see:    Internal Security Fund — borders and visa  (  European Commission  ).

It is on the basis of this definition (given in Article 1) that the Financial Regulation goes on to      shape the European Union's financial architecture step by step. Subsequent articles of the Regulation introduce the key concepts underlying the budget and lay down the procedures and rules for its establishment and implementation. The main features of the Financial Regulation are summarised below. More detailed questions can be answered by referring to the text of the Regulation itself.      I. European budgetary law in 16 definitions       The financial year      : The financial year runs for 12 months from 1 January to 31 December. The budget comprises all expenditure and revenue authorised for that year. The appropriations entered in the budget are authorised only for the duration of one financial year.       (See point 12 - Carryover of appropriations).       Differentiated appropriations      : One of the principles governing the Community's financial system is annuality. This means that operations relate to a given financial year, making it easier to control the work of the Community executive. However, multiannual operations are often necessary (e.g. research programmes, structural measures, etc), in which case the notion of differentiated appropriations is used. Differentiated appropriations, as opposed to non-differentiated appropriations, are split into commitment appropriations and payment appropriations. Operations extending over more than one financial year have a deadline attached, i.e. a date by which the relevant projects must be completed.      Commitment appropriations:      Commitment appropriations cover the total cost, in the current financial year, of the legal obligations entered into for operations to be carried out over more than one financial year. This type of appropriation constitutes the upper limit of expenditure which can be committed during the financial year.      Payment appropriations:      Payment appropriations cover expenditure arising from commitments entered into during the current financial year or preceding years.      Appropriations for commitment:      This term refers to the sum of commitment appropriations and non-differentiated appropriations.*      Appropriations for payment:      This term refers to the sum of payment appropriations and non-differentiated appropriations. *In effect, non-differentiated appropriations authorise an equal amount of commitments and payments, so that both aspects must be fully taken into account.      Principles of sound financial management:      Principles underlying the use of budget appropriations, including economy, cost-effectiveness, evaluation prior to mobilisation of Community resources, regular review of operations, etc.      Financial statement:      The financial statement sets out the various financial aspects of an operation (financial consequences, links with financial instruments, schedule, etc). Any proposal or communication which may have budgetary consequences must include a financial statement.      No offsetting:      According to this principle, all revenue and expenditure must be entered in full with no adjustment against each other, thus ensuring an exhaustive and complete presentation of the budget.      No assignment of revenue:      This rule prevents specific revenue from being used to finance specific expenditure. Total revenue covers total expenditure. There are exceptions to this principle: for example Member States' financial contributions to certain research programmes and contributions from non-member countries to Community activities under the Agreement on the European Economic Area.      Booking of revenue and expenditure to articles:      Revenue can be collected and expenditure effected only if it is booked to an article in the budget. This means that all financial operations (revenue or expenditure) must have a budgetary basis, i.e. a specific article in the budget. In addition, no expenditure may exceed the authorised appropriations.      Carryover of appropriations:      As a general rule, non-differentiated appropriations lapse if they are not used at the end of the financial year for which they are entered. However, in the case of payments outstanding in respect of commitments entered into before the end of the financial year, appropriations left unused must be transferred to the budget of the following year. Optional carryovers are possible when requirements cannot be met from the budget of the following financial year. Differentiated appropriations (consisting of commitment appropriations and payment appropriations) also lapse if they are not used at the end of the financial year, although a decision may be taken to carry them over in certain instances (e.g. where the basic legislative instrument is adopted at the end of December and the Commission is unable to commit the amounts before 31 December).      Provisional twelfths:      If the budget is not finally adopted by the beginning of the financial year, i.e. 1 January, the "provisional twelfths" system comes into operation. In this case, payments may be made monthly up to a limit of one twelfth of the appropriations entered in the budget of the previous financial year.      Adoption of the budget:      The adoption of the budget marks the end of the budget procedure. The budget, which is drawn up in euros, is declared adopted by the President of Parliament and then published in the Official Journal. Once the budget has been finally adopted, each Member State is required to make available to the Community its own resources payments with effect from 1 January of the following financial year.      Reserves:      Under European budgetary law, there are six types of reserves, of which three are expressly provided for by the Financial Regulation:     These reserves are designed to facilitate budget management. They can be drawn on - during the financial year - to enter amounts in a budget line for an operation that was not entirely finalised when the budget was adopted, to increase the authorised appropriations in order to deal with unforeseen circumstances or to reduce the authorised appropriations for the sake of economy, taking into account the progress made in implementation. The reserves can be used only by implementing a transfer procedure.     The financial perspective provides for three other reserves designed to create room for manoeuvre, so that expenditure can be covered even where the requirements could not easily have been foreseen when the financial perspective was drawn up:      Discharge:      The European Parliament, acting on a recommendation by the Council, grants the Commission discharge for its implementation of the budget, after examining a series of reports, in particular that of the Court of Auditors. The purpose is to bring the financial year to a close in both formal and political terms. The discharge decision covers the accounts of all Community revenue and expenditure and the situation described in the balance sheet (statement of assets and liabilities). It consists of an appraisal of how the Commission has discharged its responsibility for budget management over the past financial year.      II. Establishment of the budget      The first stage in the process leading to the establishment of the budget is that each institution (Parliament, the Council, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the Economic and Social Committee and Committee of the Regions and the Ombudsman) draws up estimates of its expenditure and revenue for the following year and sends them to the Commission.     After receiving the various estimates, the Commission draws up the preliminary draft budget, which must be presented by 1 September and contains:      a general statement of the revenue of the Communities;       a statement of estimates;       a general introduction including financial tables covering the entire budget and a description of the policies for which the appropriations are requested;       an introduction to each section, drafted by the institution concerned;       a working paper on the staff of the institutions (staff policy, variation in staff numbers, etc);       a working paper on subsidies to decentralised bodies (agencies, European schools etc);       an analysis of financial management over the past year and a balance sheet setting out the Communities' assets and liabilities;       an opinion on the estimates of the other institutions.      During the procedure, the Commission may amend this preliminary draft by sending a letter of amendment to the Council at least 30 days before Parliament's first reading of the draft budget.     In exceptional circumstances, the Commission may present preliminary draft supplementary and/or amending budgets, which are examined according to the usual budgetary procedure. A preliminary draft supplementary budget either increases the total amount of appropriations or finances new operations without increasing appropriations. A preliminary draft amending budget makes technical changes, without increasing the overall budget or providing for new operations. These preliminary drafts must be accompanied by statements of justification.     The budgetary procedure is laid down in Article 272 of the EC Treaty. After examining the preliminary draft budget, the Council sends Parliament a draft budget, accompanied by an explanatory memorandum explaining why it has departed from the preliminary draft budget, if it has done so.      III. Structure and presentation of the budget      The budget contains a general statement of revenue (estimated revenue of the Communities for the financial year in question and actual revenue in the previous financial year), plus a number of sections subdivided into statements of revenue (revenue for the financial year in question and the previous year, together with the relevant remarks) and expenditure. The various sections cover:     The Commission section contains a Part A (staff and administrative expenditure) and a Part B (operational expenditure). Part B is broken down into several sub-sections, according to requirements. These subsections, which correspond to European Union policies, are shown in the table below. The figures are taken from the 1999 budget.

The statement of expenditure in each section (i.e. for each institution) includes, for the various titles, chapters, articles and items (each subdivision being accompanied by remarks):      the appropriations made available for the financial year in question;       the appropriations made available for the previous financial year;       actual expenditure in the last financial year (= actual payments plus carryovers to the following financial year).       IV. Implementation of the budget      The implementation of the budget is based on a fundamental principle - the need for a legislative basis - which has been both the cause and the result of a series of crises between the two arms of the budgetary authority. The implementation of appropriations entered in the budget for "significant" Community action requires the prior adoption of a basic act, i.e. a legal provision such as a regulation, a decision, etc., providing for the expenditure. Pilot schemes and certain kinds of information activities are deemed not to be "significant", so that they can be put into effect merely on the basis of the relevant line in the Community budget.     The Community budget is implemented by the European Commission, acting under its own responsibility, in accordance with the Financial Regulation and within the limits of the appropriations entered in the budget. But while the Commission's implementing responsibilities cover its own internal operations and Community policies, the other institutions (Parliament and the Council, etc.) implement the sections of the budget which concern them. This power to implement the budget cannot be delegated to external bodies, at least in relation to the tasks of the European civil service (e.g. public procurement). Implementing powers may be delegated within the European administration so that certain officials act as authorising officers, accounting officers and financial controllers. In practical terms, it is they who implement the budget. This internal delegation of powers is subject to strict conditions in order to avoid conflicts of interest or abuse of power.     Within the European administration the implementation of the Community budget rests on the existence of three different functions, which must be performed separately: authorising officer, accounting officer and financial controller.     The       authorising officer      administers the appropriations. He alone has the power to "commit" expenditure, i.e. to give the initial authorisation for expenditure. The authorising officer is liable to disciplinary action and may be held financially liable if he fails to comply with the Financial Regulation or neglects tasks relating to his function.     The       accounting officer      makes the payments. He is the only person empowered to handle monies and other assets and is also responsible for their safekeeping. The accounting officer is liable to disciplinary action and may be held financially liable for payments in which a procedural error is detected. Officials performing accounting functions receive a special allowance to compensate for their increased responsibility vis-à-vis "ordinary" officials.     The       financial controller      carries out monitoring and audit tasks. He checks the commitment and authorisation of all expenditure and ensures that revenue is properly collected. In short, he checks the legality of operations. To carry out this task, the financial controller has access to all the necessary documents and information. In his capacity as auditor, he is also regularly consulted on and evaluates changes to financial management systems. Commission staff exercising this function are governed by special rules guaranteeing their independence (for example, in certain cases they may bring actions before the Court of Justice). The financial controller is liable to disciplinary action and may be held financially liable if he grants his approval to expenditure in excess of the budget appropriations.     In a stricter sense, implementation of the Community budget consists mainly of expenditure, which, under budgetary law, is broken down into various stages: commitment, validation, authorisation and payment:         1 Commitment             Prior to any measure which may give rise to expenditure (in particular legal commitments vis-à-vis third parties), the authorising officer must draw up a proposal for a budgetary commitment on which the financial controller must grant his approval. The purpose of the financial controller's approval is to establish that the appropriations are available and that the expenditure is consistent with the relevant legislation and correctly charged to the budget. If some of these conditions are not met, the financial controller may refuse to grant his approval. The superior authority may overrule such a refusal, informing the Court of Auditors of its decision, but this hypothetical facility is rarely used in practice.             2 Validation             Validation is the act whereby the authorising officer checks the claim of the creditor (the recipient of expenditure), the amount of that claim and the conditions under which payment falls due. Validation is subject to presentation of supporting documents.             3 Authorisation             Authorisation is the act whereby the authorising officer instructs the accounting officer to pay an item of expenditure which he has validated. Payment orders are sent for prior approval to the financial controller, the purpose being to establish, among other things, that the payment order agrees with the commitment of expenditure and that the amount is correct. After approval, the order is forwarded to the accounting officer.             4 Payment             Payment is the final action whereby the institution is discharged of its obligations towards its creditors. It is carried out by the accounting officer.         Appropriations are classified under chapters and articles. Parliament and the Council may transfer appropriations from one chapter to another and from one article to another within their own section of the budget. The Commission may, within its section of the budget, transfer appropriations from one article to another within each chapter and from one chapter to another within each of the titles relating to staff and administrative expenditure. The Commission informs the budgetary authority of these transfers, giving a statement of the grounds.     The balance from each financial year is entered in the budget of the following financial year as revenue or expenditure, depending on whether it represents a surplus or a deficit.     During the financial year, the Commission sends Parliament, the Council and the Court of Auditors figures on the implementation of the budget in the form of:      monthly reports on both revenue and expenditure, together with information on the use of appropriations carried over from previous financial years;       a report every four months on revenue and expenditure, together with information on the use of appropriations carried over from previous financial years.      In the course of the year, following a given financial year, the Commission produces several documents describing its financial activities in that financial year. By no later than 1 May of the following year, it draws up a       consolidated revenue and expenditure account      comprising:     The revenue and expenditure account encompasses all revenue and expenditure operations relating to the past financial year for each institution. It is presented in the same form as the budget. At the same time, the Commission presents a       consolidated balance sheet      setting out the Communities' assets and liabilities, including borrowing and lending operations, and an       analysis of financial management.      The institutions comply with existing European legislation regarding public procurement.     The Communities' movable and immovable property is recorded in an inventory, which is used in drawing up each institution's balance sheet.     The Community accounts are kept in euros, using the double entry method, on the basis of the calendar year. The accounts show all revenue and expenditure for the financial year and are supplemented by supporting documents.     The Court of Auditors monitors the implementation of the Community budget. The institutions send it all the supporting documents required for that purpose. The object of the Court's supervision is to ensure that revenue and expenditure is legal and consistent with the Treaties, the budget and Community legislation. The Court also ensures that sound financial management is practiced. The Court's comments are set out in its annual report. It may present special reports when it wishes to comment on specific matters. Special reports may also be drawn up at the request of an institution.      V.

act   Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament: Tackling crime in our digital age: establishing a European Cybercrime Centre (  COM(2012) 140 final  of 28 March 2012).   summary   Cybercrime refers to criminal acts that are committed online using computers and communications networks (for example, the Internet). Cybercrime’s borderless nature calls for coordination and cooperation among law enforcement agencies. The European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), part of  Europol  and based in the Netherlands, plays a crucial role in disrupting the operations of the criminal gangs who commit cybercrime.   Focus   EC3 targets cybercrimes:        —     committed by organised crime groups, particularly those generating substantial illicit profits such as online fraud;            —     which cause serious harm to their victims, such as online child sexual exploitation; and            —     affecting critical infrastructure and information systems in the EU (including denial of service attacks designed to make targeted websites unusable).       Functions         1.      European cybercrime information focal point:  to gather information on cybercrime from a wide range of sources, identify trends and threats and improve intelligence.            2.      Pooling expertise to support EU countries in capacity building:  mainly focusing on police and judiciary training.            3.      Operational support to member countries:  encouraging the establishment of cross-border  joint investigation teams  to tackle specific cybercrime issues and the exchange of operational information in ongoing investigations. They will also provide storage, encryption (encoding messages or data to prevent unauthorised access) expertise and other online tools and facilities.            4.      The collective voice of European cybercrime investigators across law enforcement and the judiciary:  in discussions with the ICT industry and other private sector companies as well as with the research community, users’ associations and citizens’ groups.      related act   European Cybercrime Centre,  First year report  , February 2014.
   Turkey – Justice and security     Turkey – Justice and security     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM(2011) 666      final – SEC(2011) 1201 – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The       2011 Report      presents a mixed picture concerning the justice and security of the country. With regard to the judiciary, advancements can be identified such as the adoption of legislation on the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors and on the Constitutional Court. Anti-corruption and the protection of human rights and minorities have not progressed very much, while uneven progress can be noted in the areas of justice, freedom and security.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission's words)      EU policies in the area of justice and home affairs aim at maintaining and developing the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice. On issues such as border control, visas, migration, asylum, police cooperation, combating organised crime and cooperation with regard to drug trafficking, customs cooperation and judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters, Member States need to be equipped to ensure that they are able to implement adequate standards and an increasing number of common rules. In order to do this, it is important first and foremost that the bodies responsible for applying the law and other competent bodies have robust and integrated administrative capacities which comply with the set standards. The setting up of a professional, reliable and efficient police force is of paramount importance. The Schengen       acquis      , which entails the lifting of internal border controls in the EU, is the most detailed element of the EU’s policies on justice, freedom and security. However, substantial parts of the Schengen       acquis      are implemented by the new Member States, following a separate decision taken by the Council after their accession.     EU policies relating to the judicial system and fundamental rights aim at pursuing and aiding the development of the Union as an area for freedom, security and justice. The establishment of an independent and efficient judicial system is of paramount importance. Impartiality, integrity and a high level of competency regarding the rulings made by courts are essential in maintaining the rule of law. This requires a firm commitment to eliminate all external influences on the judicial system and to dedicate the appropriate financial resources and training facilities to it. It is necessary to offer the necessary legal guarantees to ensure fair judicial procedures. Member States must also tackle corruption effectively insofar as it represents a risk to the stability of democratic institutions and the rule of law. It is necessary to establish a solid judicial framework and reliable institutions to which a coherent policy for preventing and dissuading corruption may be applied. Member States must ensure that the fundamental rights and the rights of EU citizens, as guaranteed by the       acquis      and the Charter for Fundamental Rights, are respected.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      Progress has been made in the area of the       judiciary      . The adoption of legislation on the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors and on the Constitutional Court provides the framework for enhanced independence and impartiality of the judiciary. Measures have also been taken to improve the efficiency of the judiciary and address the increasing backlog of pending cases. Further steps are still needed in all areas, including the criminal justice system. Turkey has a large backlog of pending criminal serious cases while a large proportion of the prison population is not finally sentenced. In addition, implementation needs to be monitored, as measures taken to date have divided the country's legal community and civil society. Judicial proceedings are not sufficiently transparent. Courts and prosecution offices do not inform stakeholders or the public at large on issues of public interest. The judicial reform strategy needs to be revised with the participation of all stakeholders, the Turkish legal community and civil society.     The implementation of the strategy and the       anti-corruption      action plan is at an initial stage. Corruption remains prevalent in many areas. The lack of transparency of political party financing and the scope of immunities remain major challenges. Increased political support is needed in order to strengthen and implement the legislative framework on anti-corruption.     Concerning       human rights and the protection of minorities      , limited progress has been made. Significant efforts are needed in most areas, in particular freedom of expression and freedom of religion.     Progress achieved in the area of       justice, freedom and security      has been uneven. The adoption of the Law on Foreigners and International Protection remains a priority to ensure a sound legal basis for an efficient asylum and migration management system, as well as safeguards for the rights of migrants and refugees. There is only limited progress to report in the area of judicial cooperation in criminal and civil matters. Some progress can be reported in the area of drugs and organised crime. Limited progress can be reported in the area of police cooperation and terrorism. Limited progress has been achieved on visa policy and customs cooperation. Very limited progress can be reported in the area of border management where the key issues are the adoption of a law on the establishment of new Border Security Agency and inter-agency cooperation. Turkey remains an important country of transit and destination of irregular migrants. Efforts are needed to prevent irregular migration and to readmit irregular migrants.     RELATED ACTS      Commission Report [         COM(2010) 660        final – SEC(2010) 1327 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2010 Report presented substantial progress made in matters relating to immigration and asylum policy. Improvements had also been made in combating drug trafficking and in the area of customs cooperation. However, effort was still required concerning judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters, external border control, visa policy, combating organised crime and the fight against terrorism.      Commission Report [         COM(2009) 533        final – SEC(2009) 1334 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The October 2009 Report noted that Turkey achieved uneven progress in its alignment with EU legislation. Limited progress was achieved in the areas of external borders and Schengen, as well as immigration and asylum. The system for asylum still needed to be reorganised. Only little progress was made on visa policy and none on judicial cooperation.      Commission Report [         COM(2008) 674        final – SEC(2008) 2699 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The November 2008 Report indicated that alignment with EU legislation was underway and that some progress had been achieved, especially in the fight against drugs and human trafficking. However, efforts needed to be stepped up, in particular on visa policy, judicial cooperation in criminal matters and the fight against organised crime. Additional efforts also needed to be made on asylum, migration and border management issues.      Commission Report [         COM(2007) 663        final – SEC(2007) 1436 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The November 2007 Report showed that Turkey had made progress in aligning its law with EU legislation and practice. Improvements had also been made in the fight against organised crime, money laundering and human trafficking. However, considerable efforts still needed to be made in the areas of police cooperation, external borders, migration and asylum.      Commission Report [         COM(2006) 649        final – SEC(2006) 1390 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The November 2006 Report noted some progress, particularly in the areas of asylum, border management, the fight against human trafficking, as well as customs and police cooperation. Alignment with EU legislation in this chapter was under way, but considerable efforts were still needed in areas such as migration, the fight against organised crime, money laundering and judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters.      Commission Report [         COM(2005) 561        final – SEC(2005) 1426 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The October 2005 report showed that Turkey had made progress in aligning its law with EU legislation and practice. Nevertheless, further progress was considered necessary in a number of important areas, such as implementation of the national action plan for alignment with the EU on illegal immigration and asylum, cooperation with the EU in combating illegal immigration and human trafficking, the national strategy to combat organised crime and the legislative framework for combating money laundering.      Commission Report [         COM(2004) 656        final – SEC(2004) 1201 – Not published in the Official Journal].      In its October 2004 Report, the Commission recognised the progress made by Turkey in aligning its legislation with the EU law and practices. Further progress was needed in the reform of the judicial system, the fight against corruption and human trafficking and the control of illegal migration.      Commission Report [         COM(2003) 676        final – SEC(2003) 1212 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The November 2003 Report noted that Turkey had made serious progress, particularly in improving and intensifying its cooperation with the EU and the Member States in a range of fields, such as the fight against illegal migration and organised crime. It still needed to implement the strategies already adopted and intensify its efforts to align its legal and institutional framework.      Commission Report [         COM(2002) 700        final – SEC(2002) 1412 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The October 2002 Report noted that the country needed to step up its efforts to align its legal framework on data protection, combating illegal immigration, reinforcing border controls and adopting legislation on asylum and immigration. It also needed to improve coordination between law enforcement services and continue the reform of its legal system.      Commission Report [         COM(2001) 700        final – SEC(2001) 1756 – Not published in the Official Journal].      In its November 2001 Report, the Commission noted that Turkey had made some progress in the field of justice and home affairs.      Commission Report [         COM(2000) 713        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      In its November 2000 Report, the Commission noted that Turkey had made no significant progress in the field of justice and home affairs. Turkey still needed to make efforts to bring itself into line with Community law in the areas of combating fraud and corruption, the fight against drugs, as well as customs and judicial cooperation.      Commission Report [         COM(1999) 513        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      The October 1999 Report stressed that, despite some improvements, progress still needed to be made, particularly on immigration and asylum (concluding readmission agreements, lifting the geographical reservation to the 1951 Geneva Convention), border controls (merging the various departments involved), the fight against organised crime (stepping up the fight against trafficking of human beings) and the fight against drug trafficking (increasing cooperation with the Member States). A number of international agreements on judicial cooperation in civil and criminal law still needed to be ratified.      Commission Report [         COM(1998) 711        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      The November 1998 Report stated that the 1995 EC-Turkey Association Council resolutions provided for cooperation between the European Union (EU) and Turkey on justice and home affairs issues. Political considerations meant that these arrangements had remained in abeyance until 1998. In that year, a meeting was held in Brussels between the specialised Council committee and the Turkish authorities, where a number of topics relating to justice and home affairs were covered. The Commission stressed the need to develop active cooperation with Turkey on immigration.

summary of   Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1141/2014 on the statute and funding of European political parties and European political foundations   what is the aim of the regulation   It aims to create a specific legal, financial and regulatory system for  European political parties   *  and  European political foundations   *  . It increases their visibility, recognition and effectiveness by giving them a European legal personality  *  and greater funding flexibility.   In 2018, Regulation (EU, Euratom)  2018/673  which amends the 2014 regulation was adopted. It tightens up a number of the rules, for example, with regard to registration of political parties and foundations, and transparency regarding political programmes and party logos. It came into force on 4 May 2018.   key points    The regulation creates the independent   Authority for European Political Parties   that  registers  ,  verifies  and  may impose penalties  on  European political parties  and  foundations  . Information concerning the parties and foundations is contained in a publicly accessible online register.   To  register  with the authority as a  European political party  , a  political alliance   *  has to satisfy certain conditions. These include:   having a seat in an EU country as indicated in its statutes;   having  member parties  represented , in at least one quarter of the EU countries, by members of the European Parliament, of national parliaments, of regional parliaments or of regional assemblies (a stipulation in Regulation (EU) 2018/673); or   it or its member parties having received, in at least one quarter of the EU countries, at least 3% of the votes cast in each of those countries at the most recent elections to the  European Parliament  ;   its member parties cannot be members of another European political party (to avoid individual members of a national party formingmore than one European party in order to maximise access to public funds).     If a European party and its affiliated foundation fail to meet the conditions, or provide false information when registering, the authority can  de-register  it; parties may also be fined or removed from the register for certain breaches of the rules.   Parties may use the EU funding they receive to finance  European Parliament election campaigns  ; spending linked to campaigns must be  clearly identified  as such by the parties in their annual financial statements.   A registered European political party that has at least one Member of the European Parliament (MEP) may apply for EU funding.   National parties must  display the logo and political manifesto  of their affiliated European party on their websites as a condition to access funds. This must be done by member parties  at least 12 months  before the funding applications are submitted.   Regulation (EU) 2018/673 ensures that  10%  of the annual EU funding is allocated equally between the eligible parties. The remaining  90%  is distributed according to their number of MEPs. The same distribution key is used for political foundations, which may have  90%  of their annual costs reimbursed.   Strict rules apply to  individual annual donations  that parties and foundations may accept. These must not exceed  €18,000  . Any donations above €12,000 have to be  immediately reported  to the authority. The names of donors of individual donations not exceeding €1,500 do not need to be published.  Anonymous donations may not be accepted  .   The European Parliament can recover amounts unduly paid, and individuals guilty of fraud must pay back misspent funds. The  European Public Prosecutor’s Office  will be called on to investigate alleged abuses in the future.   Rules on contributions from the EU’s  budget  to European political parties are included in Regulation (EU) 2018/1046, the EU’s  Financial Regulation  .   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 1 January 2017.   background   For more information, see:    European political parties and foundations  (  European Parliament  ).   key terms    European political party:  an association of citizens:   which pursues political objectives, and   which is either recognised by, or established in accordance with, the legal order of at least one EU country.     European political foundation:  an entity which is formally affiliated with a European political party, which is registered with the authority and which, through its activities, within the aims and fundamental values pursued by the EU, underpins and complements the objectives of the European political party by performing one or more of the following tasks:   observing, analysing and contributing to the debate on European public policy issues and on the process of European integration;   developing activities linked to European public policy issues, such as organising and supporting seminars, training, conferences and studies on such issues between relevant stakeholders, including youth organisations and other representatives of civil society;   developing cooperation in order to promote democracy, including in non-EU countries;   serving as a framework for national political foundations, academics, and other relevant actors to work together at European level.     Legal personality:  having legal rights and duties, such as to enter into contracts, sue, and be sued.   Political alliance:  structured cooperation between political parties and/or citizens.
   Criminal-law protection of the EU's financial interests     Criminal-law protection of the EU's financial interests     European Union policies are financed by the Community budget. Fraud affecting the Community's financial interests is a major risk. Those interests need, therefore, to be effectively protected. The Commission has put forward a proposal for a Directive on the criminal-law protection of the Community's financial interests that is aimed at aligning national criminal laws.     PROPOSAL     Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the criminal-law protection of the Community's financial interests [Official Journal C 240 E of 28.08.2001].     Amended proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the criminal-law protection of the Community's financial interests [       COM(2002) 577      final - Official Journal C 71 E of 25.03.03].     SUMMARY     The Community institutions and the Member States acknowledge the importance of effective protection for the Community's financial interests. In order to combat fraud and other illegal activities affecting those interests, the Member States signed the       Convention      of 26 July 1995 on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests and several additional protocols which provide for measures aimed in particular at aligning national criminal laws. As these instruments have still not been ratified by all the Member States, the Commission has presented a proposal for a Directive on the basis of new Article 280 of the EC Treaty introduced by the Amsterdam Treaty, which incorporates a large proportion of their provisions.     After first defining certain key terms such as Community official, national official and legal person, the proposal requires Member States to make fraud, corruption and money laundering affecting the financial interests of the Community a criminal offence in their national law.      Fraud involving expenditure as well as revenue      Fraud affecting the Community's financial interests can involve expenditure as well as revenue. Fraud can consist of any intentional act or omission relating to:      the use or presentation of false, incorrect or incomplete statements or documents;       non-disclosure of information in violation of a specific obligation;       the misuse of such funds for purposes other than those for which they were originally granted.      The acts in question must have the effect of reducing the resources of the Community budget or retaining Community funds. Member States may fix the minimum amount in order to define serious fraud. The minimum amount may not, in any event, be more than EUR 50 000.      Active and passive corruption      Passive corruption consists of the deliberate act on the part of an official of requesting or receiving advantages or accepting a promise of such an advantage as inducement to breach their official obligations and carry out or refrain from carrying out an official duty or an act in the course of their official duties in a way that damages or is likely to damage the Community's financial interests. Active corruption is the deliberate act of promising or giving an advantage of any kind to officials as inducement for them to breach their official obligations and carry out or refrain from carrying out an official duty or an act in the course of their official duties in a way that damages or is likely to damage the Community's financial interests.     In accordance with the principle of equal treatment, Member States must guarantee that acts of fraud and corruption committed by Community officials are treated in the same way as those committed by their national officials.      Money laundering       Money laundering      includes acts committed deliberately in order to:      convert or transfer property derived from criminal activity;       conceal the source, true nature or location of goods derived from criminal activity as well as the acquisition, possession or use of the above-mentioned property.The deliberate nature of the unlawful conduct must be established on the basis of objective factual circumstances.       Criminal liability and penalties within the Union      Member States are to take the necessary measures to allow persons having power to take decisions or exercise control within a business to be declared criminally liable. They will also have to define the liability of bodies corporate as well as the criminal liability of natural persons committing, instigating or being an accessory to the unlawful act. Member States will have to provide for penalties on bodies corporate such as disqualification from engaging in business activities or placing under judicial supervision.     Member States are to take the necessary measures to impose criminal penalties for the conduct referred to above (fraud, corruption, money laundering) as well as for conduct as an accessory or instigator and, with the exception of corruption, the attempted commission of such acts. In cases of serious fraud, they must provide for custodial sentences. In the case of minor fraud (involving a total of less than 4 000), they may provide for penalties other than criminal penalties.     Member States must take the necessary measures to enable the instruments and proceeds of the unlawful conduct covered by the proposal to be seized in accordance with national law.      Final provisions      The Member States must ensure that the Commission is able to provide all the technical and operational assistance required to facilitate the coordination of investigations undertaken by the relevant national authorities.     Member States will be free to adopt or maintain more stringent provisions in order to provide effective protection for the financial interests of the Community.

act   Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - Addressing the challenges of deforestation and forest degradation to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss (  COM(2008) 645 final  of 17.10.2008)   summary    what does this communication do  In this paper, the European Commission sets out lines of action for the European Union response to deforestation, invites contributions from stakeholders, and aims to kick-start initial actions that create the foundations of a global response to deforestation.   key points    The EU calls for a halt to global forest cover loss (i.e. a change from a forest to a non-forest state) by 2030 at the latest and for tropical deforestation to be reduced by at least 50 % by 2020 as compared to current levels.   It considers that the fight against deforestation must take place on several levels. These range from strengthening national and local forest governance and improving monitoring mechanisms, to taking into account consumer demand and creating financial incentives to preserve forests. This action must take place within the framework of international agreements, such as the UN’s  Convention on Biodiversity  and  Framework Convention on Climate Change  .   It shows that policies already in place in the EU can help tackle deforestation, such as the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (  FLEGT  );  green public procurement  ;  eco-labelling  ; and work carried out in the framework of the Global Climate Change Alliance (  GCCA  ).   It indicates how proceeds from the Emissions Trading System (  EU ETS  ) could be used to help fund the fight against deforestation.   It proposes the setting up of a global mechanism for incentivising the preservation of tropical forests, which has become  REDD+  (i.e. Reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation, including through afforestation, conservation and sustainable management of forests).   background   Covering roughly 30 % of the world’s land (and 40 % of the EU’s land mass), forests are integral to environmental health. They provide important habitats for biodiversity, crucial services such as erosion prevention, water purification and carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) storage and sustain the livelihoods of 1.6 billion people globally.  Meanwhile, forests are under threat from deforestation, which destroys 13 million hectares every year according to the  Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations  (FAO). The main causes of this are conversion to agriculture and poorly controlled infrastructure development.

summary of   Regulation (EU) No 386/2012 on the European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights   what is the aim of this regulation  It entrusts the EU Intellectual Property Office,  EUIPO  (formerly the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market, OHIM), with tasks supporting the activities of national authorities, the private sector and EU institutions in the fight against infringements of  intellectual property rights (IPR)  covered by  Directive 2004/48/EC  .   key points   EUIPO is responsible for bringing together experts, authorities and stakeholders under the umbrella of the  European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights  (the observatory), although its tasks do not extend to participation in individual operations or investigations carried out by the competent authorities.  It has the following tasks:   improving understanding of  the value of intellectual property  ;   improving understanding of  the scope and impact of IPR infringements  ;   enhancing knowledge of  best public and private sector practices  to protect IPR;   helping to raise  citizens’ awareness of the impact  of IPR infringements;   enhancing the  expertise of persons involved  in IPR enforcement;   enhancing knowledge of  technical tools to prevent and tackle IPR infringements  , including tracking and tracing systems which help to distinguish genuine products from counterfeit ones;   providing  mechanisms which help to improve the online exchange  , between EU countries working on IPR, of information relating to enforcement, and fostering cooperation;   working, in consultation with EU countries, to  foster international cooperation  with IPR bodies in non-EU countries to build strategies and develop techniques, skills and tools for IPR enforcement.    Observatory meetings   At least once a year, EUIPO will host meetings of representatives from public administrations and organisations from EU countries dealing with IPR and a broad, representative and balanced range of private-sector representatives most concerned by or most experienced in the fight against IPR infringements (rights holders, including authors and other creators) as well as internet intermediaries. Consumer organisations,  small and medium-sized enterprises  , authors and other creators must be properly represented.  Representatives of the  European Parliament  and from the  European Commission  are invited to participate or observe, as appropriate.  Private-sector representatives meeting as part of the observatory are expected to keep EUIPO informed of their IPR-enforcement policies and strategies and to provide statistical data on infringements in their field of activity.   Work programme   EUIPO will draw up an  annual work programme  prioritising the observatory’s activities set out in the regulation and for the observatory meetings, in line with the EU's IPR policies and priorities and in cooperation with representatives from the observatory.   Management report   The annual management report contains at least the following information concerning EUIPO’s tasks and activities under this regulation:   a review of the main activities carried out during the year;   the results achieved during the year, accompanied by reports analysing the situation in the different industry and product sectors;   an overall assessment of the fulfilment of EUIPO’s tasks;   an overview of future activities;   observations on the enforcement of IPR and potential future policies and strategies, including how to enhance effective cooperation with and between EU countries;   an overall assessment of representation in the observatory.    Evaluation   A report will evaluate the regulation’s application with particular regard to its impact on IPR enforcement in the EU’s single market.   from when does this regulation apply  It applies from 5 June 2012.   background   For more information, see:    Enforcement of intellectual property rights  (  European Commission  )    Counterfeit, piracy and other IPR violations  (  European Commission  ).
   Enlargement of the euro area after 1 May 2004     Enlargement of the euro area after 1 May 2004     Ten new Member States joined the European Union on 1 May 2004. Two more, Bulgaria and Romania, acceded on 1 January 2007. However, they did not introduce the single currency straight away: the new Member States must first show that they are ready to adopt the euro and meet the "convergence criteria". As soon as these conditions are met, the new Member States will be required to introduce the euro.     ACT     Communication of 10 November 2005 from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and the European Central Bank: First report on the practical preparations for the future enlargement of the euro area [       COM(2004) 748      final – Official Journal C 49 of 28.2.2006].     SUMMARY     The introduction of the euro requires careful practical preparation. The European Commission regularly reports on the state of practical preparations for introducing the euro. This communication is the first report intended to inform all interested parties, such as the European institutions, the Member States, the general public and the media. These reports are issued for information purposes only and have no legal value; they should not be confused with the convergence reports.      Preparing for the introduction of the single currency      The introduction of the euro needs to be prepared well in advance. For practical and logistical reasons, the first wave of euro area countries opted for a three-year transitional period between adopting the euro as a currency and putting euro banknotes and coins into circulation. But a "big bang" scenario in which entry into the euro area coincides with the introduction of euro notes and coins could also have its advantages, in particular because the Member States of the European Union are already familiar with euro notes and coins.      Lessons drawn from the previous changeover      The Commission notes that the first changeover to the euro was a success, although there was room for improvement in several respects. Early, thorough preparation is therefore necessary in order to ensure a speedy changeover and public acceptance of the new currency. The Commission takes the view that the transitional period of three years was too long and hopes that euro notes and coins will be introduced swiftly, for the benefit of all parties involved. It would prefer the period of dual circulation to be short.     The Commission also stresses that national authorities must take steps to avoid any impact on prices, for example as a result of shopkeepers and retailers converting prices incorrectly. Active involvement of consumer organisations would be welcome. The authorities could require retailers to publicly display their commitment to making an exact price conversion in order to ensure credibility and enable consumers to bring pressure to bear.      Context      Since the 2004 enlargement wave, several new Member States have joined the euro area:       Slovenia        , on 1 January 2007;        Cyprus and Malta        , on 1 January 2008;        Slovakia        , on 1 January 2009;        Estonia        , on 1 January 2011.      At present, therefore, 17 out of 27 Member States have adopted the euro as single currency.

This Communication presents and evaluates the preparations made in Slovakia for the introduction of the euro: the preparations for the introduction of euro notes and coins, the adaptation of businesses and the public administration to the changeover and the public information campaign on the euro.      Communication of 18 July 2008 from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and the European Central Bank: Seventh report on the practical preparations for the future enlargement of the euro area [         COM(2008) 480        final – Official Journal C 76 of 25.3.2010].      The Commission presents the progress of the practical preparations for the introduction of the euro in Slovakia, scheduled for 1 January 2009, under a “big bang” scenario. It doubts the efficiency of the existing coordination structure and suggests that the central monitoring of preparations for the changeover to the euro should be reinforced.

   Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) (2007-2013)     Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) (2007-2013)     Reflecting the objectives of the Lisbon strategy, the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme CIP supports measures to strengthen competitiveness and innovation capacity in the European Union (EU) for the period 2007-2013. It particularly encourages the use of information technologies, environmental technologies and renewable energy sources.     ACT     Decision       1639/2006/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 2006 establishing a Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (2007-2013) [       See amending act(s)      ].     SUMMARY     The Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) proposes a coherent framework to improve competitiveness       *      and innovation capacity       *      in the European Union (EU). The actions it supports encourage the development of a knowledge society and sustainable development based on balanced economic growth.     The framework programme incorporates specific Community support programmes, new actions and synergies with other programmes, thus meeting the objectives of the       renewed Lisbon Strategy      for simpler, more visible and better targeted Community action.      Specific programmes      To take account of the diversity of its objectives and ensure that these are visible, the CIP is made up of three specific subprogrammes. The interests of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and eco-innovation are cross-cutting priorities reflected throughout the framework programme.       The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme        brings together activities to promote entrepreneurship, industrial competitiveness and innovation. It specifically targets SMEs         *        , from hi-tech “gazelles” (companies with high growth potential) to the traditional micro-businesses and family firms which make up a large majority of European enterprises. It facilitates SMEs’ access to finance and investment during their start-up and growth phase. It also gives businesses access to information and advice on the functioning and opportunities of the internal market, as well as to information on Community legislation applying to them and on future legislation so that they can prepare to adapt in a cost-effective way. In this context, the         Enterprise Europe Network        plays an important role. The programme also makes provision for the exchange of best practices between Member States in order to create a better regulatory and administrative environment for business and innovation. Finally, it backs the promotion of eco-innovation         *        by encouraging efforts to tap the full potential of environmental technologies.       The         objective of the ICT Policy Support Programme        is to promote the adoption and use of information and communication technologies (ICT), the backbone of the knowledge economy. The uptake of ICTs by both the private and public sectors helps to stimulate European innovation performance and competitiveness. The programme forms part of the         Digital Agenda for Europe        and incorporates the instruments previously financed by the eTen, eContent and Modinis programmes.       The         Intelligent Energy – Europe Programme        helps speed up efforts to achieve the objectives in the field of sustainable energy. It supports improvements in energy efficiency, the adoption of new and renewable energy sources, greater market penetration for these energy sources, energy and fuel diversification, an increase in the share of renewable energy (the EU has set itself the objective of raising the share of renewable energy in gross domestic consumption to 12 % by 2010) and a reduction in final energy consumption. Particular attention is paid in this context to the transport sector. The programme follows up the         Intelligent Energy – Europe (2003-2006)        programme, which expired on 31 December 2006.       Implementation      Implementation of the CIP relies on several instruments (financial instruments, projects, networks, analyses, etc.), which can be applied in each of the specific programmes. This common “toolbox” for the different programmes helps to simplify the way the framework programme works for its users. The CIP is not just based on tried and tested measures, but also introduces new instruments.     Several Community financial instruments are involved in business support. The High Growth and Innovative SME Facility (GIF) promotes the supply of seed and early-stage capital for SMEs for their start-up, and a new feature introduced by the CIP is the provision of “follow-on” capital during their growth phase. The SME Guarantee Facility, for its part, facilitates access for SMEs to financing (loans or leasing), microcredit and equity or quasi-equity. This facility also includes a new securitisation instrument for bank loan portfolios to help mobilise additional loan financing for SMEs.     The CIP strengthens and develops business and innovation support services which disseminate information to businesses on Community policies, legislation and programmes, particularly concerning the internal market and framework research programmes. These services also offer businesses information on innovation, technology and knowledge transfer and provide feedback from them for impact assessments and policy development.     A new mechanism fosters cooperation among national and regional programmes to promote business innovation, thus providing businesses with other ways of benefiting from ideas, know-how and market opportunities in other European regions.     The framework programme also supports pilot market replication projects. These aim to promote the effective marketing and economic exploitation of innovative or eco-innovative technologies and products which have already been technically demonstrated with success but have not yet penetrated the market to a significant extent. These projects are implemented through public-private partnerships.     The Intelligent Energy Executive Agency is responsible for the implementation of action under the “Intelligent Energy – Europe” programme and action under the “Enterprise and Innovation” programme.     In order to optimise the flow of knowledge and ideas, the strategic development of Community policies must continue on the basis of the open method of coordination and be backed up by new twinning actions to help Member States and regions exploit examples of best practice.      Consistency with other Community policies      The CIP links up with other key Community initiatives. Their different activities are implemented in parallel and complement each other. The framework programme is thus involved in achieving Community objectives in the fields of research, cohesion, the environment, education and training.     The CIP thus facilitates access to finance for businesses whose activities relate to innovation, research and development. It also helps businesses get involved in the       7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development      (FP7-RTD).      Budget      The framework programme will run for seven years, from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013. It has been allocated a budget of €3.621 billion for that period.     According to an indicative breakdown, 60 % of the overall budget (€2.170 billion) is allocated to the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme. One fifth of this (€430 million) is earmarked for promoting eco-innovation. 20 % of the overall budget (€730 million) has been allocated to the ICT Policy Support Programme, and the last 20 % (€730 million) is for the Intelligent Energy – Europe Programme.     Costs that are eligible under several instruments cannot be funded twice.      Monitoring and assessment      The Commission carries out regular monitoring of the implementation of the framework-programme and the specific programmes which come under it. Each year it drafts a report to provide an update of the activities supported using indicators concerning the financial implementation, the results achieved and, where possible, the impact of the actions implemented.     The framework-programme and the specific programmes which come under it are subject to an intermediary assessment and a final assessment. These assessments examine aspects such as the relevance, the coherence and synergies, effectiveness, the efficient use of resources, and the sustainability, etc. of the actions. Furthermore, the final assessment verifies to what extent the framework-programme as a whole, and each of its specific individual programmes, have achieved their objectives.      Context      The       Lisbon Process      , whose objective is to make Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, has naturally made competitiveness one of the EU’s key political concerns. In order to ensure greater coherence between the different programmes involved in the Community’s efforts to enhance competitiveness, and in response to the objectives set by the renewed Lisbon Strategy, the European Commission is proposing a framework programme for innovation and competitiveness.       Key terms used in the act         Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)           :          Competitiveness: the capacity of enterprises to adapt quickly to change, exploit their innovation potential and develop high-quality products.         Innovation: renewal and extension of the range of products and services, introduction of new design, production, supply and distribution methods, introduction of changes to management methods, work organisation and employees’ terms and conditions of employment and qualifications.         Eco-innovation: any form of innovation intended to achieve the objective of sustainable environmentally-friendly development by reducing the impact on the environment or by using natural resources, especially energy, in a more efficient and responsible manner.

summary of   Regulation (EU) 2018/644 — cross-border parcel delivery services   what is the aim of the regulation  It aims to:   improve price transparency and regulatory oversight; and   ensure that citizens and small businesses have access to reasonably priced cross-border parcel delivery services.   key points    Scope   The regulation sets out rules for cross-border parcel delivery concerning 3 main aspects:    regulatory oversight  of parcel delivery services;    transparency of certain single-piece tariffs  through publication on a website; and    assessments where tariffs are subject to a universal service obligation   *  to identify those tariffs that are unreasonably high.    Information to be provided   Parcel delivery services are required to provide certain information to the  national regulatory authority  (NRA)  *  of the EU country in which they are based including:   name, legal status and form, company and VAT (value-added tax) registration, address and contact details;   characteristics and description of services offered;   general terms and conditions for their services, including complaints procedure;   by 30 June of each calendar year:   annual turnover;   number of persons employed;   number of parcels handled;   name of sub-contractors;   tariff list for the current year.     Companies  employing fewer than 50 people  and providing services only in the country in which they are established do not have to provide this information, although  exceptions  do apply.   Transparency   The tariffs subject to transparency measures will be published by the  European Commission  on a dedicated website by the  end of March  each year.   Assessment of cross-border tariffs   NRAs assess the affordability of the tariffs subject to the universal service obligation that they consider necessary to assess. They consider a number of elements including:   whether tariffs are affordable and cost-oriented, as well as transparent and non-discriminatory;   domestic and any other relevant tariffs for comparable parcel delivery services in both the dispatching EU country and the EU country of destination;   any application of a uniform tariff to 2 or more EU countries;   volumes, specific transportation or handling costs, other relevant costs and service quality standards;   the likely impact of the applicable cross-border tariffs on individual and  small- and medium-sized enterprise  users.   NRAs must submit an  assessment  to the Commission by the end of June of the relevant calendar year. A  non-confidential version  of the assessment must be published by the Commission within 1 month of its receipt.   Penalties   Rules for the penalties for infringing the regulation are set by EU countries and must be  effective, proportionate and dissuasive  .   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 22 May 2018.   background   For more information, see:    EU postal legislation  (  European Commission  )    Parcel delivery in the EU  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Universal service obligation:  EU countries must ensure that citizens are provided with a postal service of a specified quality anywhere in their country at an affordable price.   National regulatory authority (NRA):  a body that regulates postal services at national level. It ensures the proper functioning of the universal service obligation and undistorted competition in postal services.
summary of   Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 on flavourings for use in and on foods   what is the aim of the regulation   It lays down the general requirements for the safe use of flavourings  *  in food.   It also includes, for example, certain labelling requirements that must be respected.   It contains, in an annex, a list of approved flavourings.   key points    Flavourings must not pose a safety risk to consumers (on the basis of the scientific evidence available), and not mislead them.   The regulation defines what are, for example, flavourings, flavouring substances, flavouring preparations, smoke flavourings, thermal process flavourings, flavour precursors, and food ingredients with flavourings properties.   This legislation does not apply to substances with only an exclusively sweet (e.g. sugar), salty (e.g. salt) or sour taste, or to raw foods or mixtures such as fresh, dried or frozen spices and/or herbs, or to teas and infusions. Substances providing a sweet taste are sweeteners which constitute a specific category of food additives.   It also lays down which types of flavourings need to undergo an evaluation and approval process and which ones do not.   The EU adopted a  list  of approved flavouring substances on 1 October 2012. Only these flavouring substances may be used in and on foods and sold in the EU. The list is updated periodically.   The regulation also contains a list of 15 naturally occurring substances of toxicological concern. These include estragol, menthofuran, methyleugenol, hydrocyanic acid and coumarin and may not be added to food as such. Maximum levels are set for the presence of certain of these naturally occurring substances in foods.They may be present, such as as certain traditional foods or certain alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.    As regards labelling, flavourings sold from business to business or to the general public have to comply with specific rules in addition to the requirements in Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 on providing  food information to consumers on labelling  . The specific rules for the labelling of flavourings in and on foods relate to both regulations when sold to the general public and from business to business.   The term ‘natural’ to describe a flavouring may only be used for substances derived directly from animal or vegetable material.   Food business operators (flavouring producers, or importers or users of flavourings like the food industry) must report to the  European Commission  on the amounts they have added to foods over a 12-month period, if so requested.   A producer or user of a flavouring must inform the Commission of any scientific or technical information which is known and accessible to them and which might affect the assessment of the safety of the flavouring.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 20 January 2011.   background   For more information, see:    Food flavourings: EU rules  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Flavourings:  substances used to impart or modify the odour and taste of food. Uniform EU rules and standards ensure they do not pose a risk to human health and may be used in all EU countries.
summary   The pan-EU elections are a unique exercise in multinational democracy and will give the peoples of Europe a chance to influence the future political direction of the Union for the foreseeable future. They are the first since the Lisbon Treaty in 2009 gave the European Parliament several important new powers. This will be the eighth time that voters have selected their European representatives since the first direct elections in June 1979.   When is election day?   Each EU country has its own electoral laws determining the day on which its citizens will vote during the 4-day election period. The results will start to be announced only after the last polling booth closes on Sunday 25 May.   Who can vote and stand as a candidate?   Nationals of an EU country can vote and stand as candidates for the European Parliament in their own country provided they meet the requisite criteria, such as being on the electoral roll. Under European legislation adopted in 1993, they may also exercise the same rights if they are living in another EU country.  To do so, they must be EU citizens, be resident in the EU country where they propose to vote or stand, and satisfy the same conditions as a national of that country. This last requirement ensures compliance with the principle of equality between national and non-national voters.  However, no-one may vote more than once or stand as a candidate in more than one EU country.   How many MEPs will be elected?   Since Croatia joined the EU in July 2013, the European Parliament has had 766 members (MEPs). This number will be scaled down to 751 at the elections and will remain at that level in future. Countries with larger populations have more seats than smaller ones, but the latter have more seats than they would receive under strict proportionality.   Why are these elections different?   The elections will enable voters to express their views on the EU’s efforts to tackle the economic and financial crisis and moves towards closer economic and political integration.  One major new element introduced by the Lisbon Treaty is that EU leaders have to take account of the election results when nominating the next Commission President. The candidate put forward by the EU countries must be approved by a majority of MEPs to be elected. This means that voters now have a clear say in who will take over from Commission President Barroso in autumn 2014. As a result, the various political families, such as Christian Democrats, Socialists, Liberals and Greens, are selecting their candidates for the post of Commission President by appointing them to lead their election campaigns.

   ICT and eGovernment: European Action Plan 2011-2015     ICT and eGovernment: European Action Plan 2011-2015     This Action Plan forms part of the       2020 Digital Agenda      and aims at exploiting information and communication technologies (ICT) in order to strengthen the efficiency and dynamism of European governments.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 15 December 2010 – The European eGovernment Action Plan 2011-2015 - Harnessing ICT to promote smart, sustainable and innovative Government [       COM(2010) 743      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This Communication presents the European Commission’s eGovernment Action Plan for the period 2011-2015. It reflects the four priorities defined by the       Malmö Ministerial Declaration      (5th eGovernment Conference) in 2009.     The overall aim of this Action Plan is to facilitate the transition of current administrations to a new generation of eGovernment services at local, regional, national and European levels. In order to achieve this aim, the Commission defines four types of action to be taken to meet the priorities set out in the Malmö Declaration.      Priority 1: User empowerment      User empowerment aims at increasing the capacity of citizens, businesses and other organisations to be pro-active in society through the use of new technological tools. In order to empower users, the Commission intends to promote actions to:       develop services designed around users’ needs, and inclusive services        : this involves, for example, developing personalised online services;        introduce collaborative production of services        : the Commission wishes to undertake a study of the methods to be implemented to enable users to play an active role in the design and production of eGovernment services. It also intends to prioritise exchange of good practice in this regard;        re-use public sector information (PSI)        : the Member States are tasked with determining a common set of PSI re-use indicators;        improve transparency        : the Member States and the Commission plan to enable citizens to have online access to their personal data held by administrations;        foster the involvement of citizens and businesses in policy-making processes        : the Commission intends to develop an electronic service to support ‘citizens initiatives’.       Priority 2: Strengthening the internal market      At present it is difficult to apply for services from one country when in another EU country. In order to strengthen the internal market in this regard, the Commission proposes various initiatives to develop:       seamless business services        : large-scale pilot projects such as “         Simple procedures online for cross-border services        ” (SPOCS) and “         Pan-European Public Procurement Online        (PEPPOL) exist already. Through these initiatives, the Commission intends to put in place a cross-border infrastructure which will enable businesses to sell goods and provide services to public administrations in other countries;        personal mobility        : the Commission wishes to encourage personal mobility by developing services which enable EU citizens to study, work, reside, obtain health care and retire in the EU country of their choice;        implementation of cross-border services at EU level        : this phase requires the development of pilot projects which will enable an assessment to be made regarding which services it would be most appropriate to develop at EU level.       Priority 3: Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of Governments and administrations      In order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Governments and administrations, this Action Plan underlines the necessity to promote information and communication technologies (ICT), which would enable:       organisational processes to be improved        : the Commission wants to rationalise administrative processes by transforming the         ePractice        portal and mainstreaming online public procurement procedures;        administrative burdens to be reduced        : it is essential that public authorities use the personal data already available efficiently, while respecting citizens’ privacy. In order to do this, the Commission proposes to apply the principle of ‘once-only’ registration to certain data and to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the principle;        green administration to be prioritised        : this involves reducing the carbon footprint of administrations in Member States. To this end, the Commission intends to collect best practices in order to develop indicators and evaluation procedures specifically for government.       Priority 4: Creating preconditions for the development of eGovernment      The deployment of e-Government services in Europe requires the implementation of a certain number of conditions including:       interoperability        : this is the ability of systems and machines to exchange, process and correctly interpret information. The Commission intends to implement the interoperability framework of the         ISA        programme;        identification and authentication        : we should now go beyond simple passwords and develop a more sophisticated approach to identification and authentication, in particular through the         STORK        project. In addition, the Commission intends to propose a revision of the         eSignature Directive        to enhance security;        innovation        : it is crucial that first generation eGovernment adapts to developments in the information society in order to increase its efficiency. In this regard, it must in particular make a transition from IPv4 to IPv6 and launch pilot projects to provide more innovative services.

   Programme LIFE+     Programme LIFE+     The LIFE+ programme finances projects that contribute to the development and implementation of environmental policy and legislation. In particular, this programme facilitates the integration of environmental issues into other policies, and, more generally, it contributes to sustainable development. The LIFE+ programme replaces a number of financial instruments used for environmental policy such as the LIFE programme which preceded it.     ACT     Regulation (EC) No       614/2007      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 May 2007 concerning the Financial Instrument for the Environment (LIFE+).     SUMMARY     As its name suggests the LIFE+ programme succeeds the LIFE programme launched in 1992. Like its predecessor LIFE+ co-finances environmental projects in the European Union (EU) and in certain third countries (EU candidate counties, EFTA countries that are members of the European Environmental Agency, and the Western Balkan countries that are part of the Stabilisation and Association Process). Either private or public bodies and institutions may submit projects for funding.      The three thematic components      The LIFE+ programme is divided into three thematic components:      LIFE+ “Nature and biodiversity";       LIFE+ "Environment Policy & Governance"; and       LIFE+ "Information & Communication".      The multi-annual strategic programme set out in Annex II to this Regulation details the priority areas of action.      Duration and budgetary resources      The financial framework for LIFE+ is 2 143 409 000 for the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013.      Project selection      Each year, the Commission issues a call for proposals, taking into account the multi-annual strategic programme set out in Annex II and any national priorities it is aware of. The Commission decides which out of the submitted projects qualify for financial support under LIFE+ and regularly publishes the list of these projects.      Eligibility criteria      To qualify for funding, projects must:      be of Community interest by contributing to the development, implementation and updating of Community environmental policy and environmental legislation;       be technically and financially coherent and feasible and provide value for money;       satisfy at least one of the following criteria:       Types of intervention      Community financing may take a number of forms:      be grant agreements (framework partnership agreements, participation in financial mechanisms and funds, or co-funding of operating or action grants);       public procurement contracts (for the purchase of services and goods.       Programming      At least 78 % of LIFE+ resources are used to fund action grants for projects. The maximum rate of co-financing of action grants is 50 % of eligible costs. However, for projects concerning the protection of priority habitats or priority species, LIFE+ may finance up to 75 % of eligible costs. At least 50 % of the funds allocated to action grants for projects are reserved for nature conservation and biodiversity. In addition, at least 15 % of the funds allocated to action grants for projects are reserved for cross-border projects.     Co-financed projects must be distributed proportionately by the Commission. The Commission establishes indicative annual allocations for the periods 2007-2010 and 2010-2013 based on the total population and population density of each Member State, and the area of sites of Community importance in each Member State and the proportion of a Member State's territory covered by sites of Community importance. Additional funding may be allocated to land-locked Member States.      Complementarity between financial instruments      LIFE+ does not finance measures meeting the criteria for other Community financial instruments or that receive support from them, whether from the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, the European Fisheries Fund or the Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration activities.      Monitoring and audits      The Commission carries out audits of funding, monitors project implementation, recovers any sums improperly received, and implements the activities funded.     The Commission will carry out a mid-term review of LIFE+ by 30 September 2010 at the latest.      Background      LIFE+ replaces existing financial programmes (the LIFE programme, the       cooperation programme to promote sustainable urban development      , the       Programme promoting non-governmental organisations      and       Forest Focus      ), grouping them under a single set of rules and decision-making procedures and allowing for more consistent targeting, thereby making the Community's work more effective. Funding committed under these programmes before the entry into force of LIFE+ will remain subject to the same rules until completion.

   European Agency for Reconstruction     European Agency for Reconstruction     The European Agency for Reconstruction is responsible for implementing most of the Community assistance to the Republic of Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia (including Kosovo, as defined by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244) and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.     ACT     Council Regulation (EC) No       2667/2000      of 5 December 2000 on the European Agency for Reconstruction [       see amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     The European Agency for Reconstruction is responsible for implementing, on the basis of a Commission decision, most of the Community assistance to the Republic of Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia (including Kosovo, as defined by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244) and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.      Missions      The European Agency for reconstruction has the following tasks:      gathering, analysing and communicating information to the Commission on damage, the requirements for reconstruction and the return of refugees and displaced persons, and the areas requiring urgent assistance;       preparing draft programmes for the reconstruction of these three countries and the return of refugees and displaced persons;       implementing Community assistance by drawing up terms of reference, preparing invitations to tender, signing contracts, concluding financing agreements, awarding contracts, evaluating and controlling projects and payments.      The Agency may also implement reconstruction programmes, programmes providing aid for the return of refugees, and programmes for the restoration of civil society and the rule of law which the Member States and other donors entrust to it, particularly under the arrangements for cooperation with international financial institutions, including the World Bank and the European Investment Bank.     The Agency may also be entrusted with following up decisions regarding support for the United Nations Interim Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK).     It may also be called upon to implement assistance to encourage the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community following a Commission decision under Regulation (EC) No       389/2006      . This possibility has never been used.      Provisions governing the Agency      The Agency's headquarters are in Thessaloniki and it has operational centres in Belgrade, Podgorica, Pristina and Skopje.     It has a Governing Board composed of one representative from each Member State and two representatives from the European Commission, plus an observer from the European Investment Bank (EIB), who does not have voting rights. They are appointed for 30 months. The Board is chaired by the Commission. The Governing Board meets at least every three months. It is responsible for approving recommendations concerning: conditions for implementation of projects, adjustments to projects currently being executed and individual projects which are particularly sensitive. It also decides on:      arrangements for evaluating the implementation of projects;       programmes by other donors for possible implementation by the Agency;       the multiannual contractual framework for Community assistance for the interim administration of Kosovo;       the presence of observers on the Governing Board;       the establishment of operational centres of the Agency.      The Director of the Agency is appointed by the Governing Board for a term of office of 30 months. He is responsible for:      preparing the draft annual action programme;       organisation of the work of the Governing Board and informing the Board;       the day-to-day administration of the Agency;       budget and staff matters;       the preparation of reports;       implementation of the Governing Board's decisions.      The Governing Board draws up a draft budget on the basis of proposals from the Director, which is submitted to the Commission and annexed to the General Budget of the EU. After the latter has been adopted, the Agency's final budget is adopted by the Governing Board.     The Director presents a quarterly activity report to the European Parliament. He also submits the Agency's detailed accounts to the Commission, the Governing Board and the Court of Auditors each year.     Once the Commission considers that the Agency has fulfilled its mandate, it will submit to the Council a proposal for the winding up of the Agency. After initially expiring on 31 December 2004, the Agency's mandate was renewed until 31 December 2006. It has been further renewed for a final time until 31 December 2008.      Context      Regulation (EC) No       1628/96      , which covered assistance for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (which became the State of Serbia and Montenegro) and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, was repealed by Regulation (EC) No       2666/2000      on Community assistance for the countries of South-Eastern Europe.     Regulation (EC) No       2667/2000      incorporates the provisions or the repealed Regulation concerning the establishment and operation of the European Agency for Reconstruction (EAR). Originally covering only Kosovo, the Agency's mandate was extended to Serbia and Montenegro and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.     The EAR works only in Serbia and Montenegro, including Kosovo under UNSCR 1244, and in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, while Community assistance for the other countries of the Western Balkans, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania, is currently implemented in a directly centralised but deconcentrated way by the Commission Delegations. The Commission decided to accredit the Croatian authorities with managing the assistance in a decentralised manner in the first quarter of 2006.

The Commission hereby reports on the Agency's future before the end of 2005, as required by Regulation No       2667/2000      . The closer links between the EU and the countries of the Western Balkans are framed by the stabilisation and association process, complemented by the Thessaloniki Agenda, which aims to ensure their accession to the EU.     In this context, there should be a degree of uniformity in the treatment of each country in the Western Balkans region so that they can gradually meet their financial responsibilities in implementing EU financial assistance in a decentralised fashion. The purpose of transferring of responsibilities for the management of pre-accession instruments to the Commission delegations (deconcentration) and the national authorities (decentralisation) is to enable applicant and potential applicant countries to become familiar with the management of structural funds by the time of accession. In this regard, the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance ("IPA"), which will be the sole aid instrument available to applicant and potential applicant countries in the period 2007-2013, fully incorporates the objective of decentralisation.     However, the Agency cannot promote such a process because of the indirect centralised manner in which it managed Community funds. In April 2006 the Commission presented a proposal for a Regulation extending the Agency's mandate until 31 December 2008, after which its activities would be suspended. The Agency should be able to complete the management of funds allocated to these countries under the CARDS Programme by that date. This extension of its mandate will also enable recipient countries to establish their own capacity at national level to gradually take on the management of funds. Moreover, up to the date on which its activities will be suspended, ongoing programmes will be transferred to the Commission and the management of Community aid will gradually be transferred to the Commission delegations. The delegations in Belgrade, Podgorica and Skopje and the office in Pristina will be upgraded.      ANNUAL REPORTS ON THE AGENCY'S ACTIVITIES       2005 Annual Report to the European Parliament and the Council of June 2006 [not published in the Official Journal].      The Agency managed 282 million in Community funds in 2005, bringing the total amount managed since it was set up to a little over 2.6 billion. The bulk of this amount was accounted for by the CARDS programme. However, it does not manage all the funds allocated to Serbia-and-Montenegro or to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Its activities are geared primarily to strengthening local and central administrations, in particular their infrastructures. It thus has an impact on the economic development of the countries in question. It also focuses on social projects, especially those relating to minorities, women, refugees and displaced persons, the strengthening of civil society, and the media. Energy reform also features among its most important work.      2004 Annual Report to the European Parliament and the Council of June 2005 [not published in the Official Journal].      The European Agency for Reconstruction managed 310 million in Community funds in 2004, bringing the total amount managed since it was set up to 2.3 billion. The programmes managed by the Agency related to the process of reform (of legislation, public administration, public finances, the rule of law) launched in the countries covered by its mandate, support for a market-oriented economy, regional development and the strengthening of civil society. Overall, it helps the governments of the countries concerned to carry out the reforms necessary with a view to their accession to the EU. The Directorate-General for Enlargement is henceforth responsible for its activities rather than the Directorate-General for External Relations. A Commission Report of 2004 acknowledged how efficiently the Agency fulfilled its mandate and the Council decided to extend it until 31 December 2006.      2003 Annual Report to the European Parliament and the Council of June 2004 [not published in the Official Journal].      The amount of funds allocated to the Agency for the management of Community programmes was 328 million in 2003, bringing the total amount managed since it was set up to 2 billion. The Agency was more involved in the delegated management of Community funds allocated to the reform process in the region designed to enhance its development and reconstruction. In particular, it managed the funds set aside for the CARDS programme. These programmes covered matters such as good governance, institution building and the rule of law. They were also concerned with the development of a market-oriented economy, whereby investment focussed on infrastructures and environmental measures. Finally, they also provide back-up to social development and the strengthening of civil society.      Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council of May 2003 - European Agency for Reconstruction. 2002 annual report [not published in the Official Journal].      On 31 December 2002 the Agency was managing a budget of 1.7 billion. The Agency's priorities are focused on reconstruction of infrastructure, reviving economic activity and supporting the media and civil society. Good governance has also become an essential focus of its activity. From 1998 to 2002 the Agency devoted 561 million to aid programmes in Serbia, 74 million to Montenegro, 830 million to Kosovo and 166.5 million to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.      Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council of 10 June 2002, - European Agency for Reconstruction. 2001 Annual Report [         COM(2002) 288        final - not published in the Official Journal].      In December 2001, the Agency's mandate was extended to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. A new office and an operational centre were established in Podgorica and Skopje respectively. In 2001, the Agency managed financial resources totalling 525 million. The programmes financed by this budget focused on three priority areas: physical and economic reconstruction (accounting for 60% of resources), development of a market-oriented economy and support for private enterprise (25% of resources), and support for democracy, human rights and the rule of law (15% of resources).      Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council of 30 July 2001 - European Agency for Reconstruction. 2001 Annual Report [         COM(2002) 288        final - not published in the Official Journal].      Since its creation, the European Agency for Reconstruction has focused its assistance on the rehabilitation of the infrastructures and public utilities required to bring life back to normal in Kosovo. The main sectors in which the Agency operated were energy, housing, transport, water, enterprise, agriculture and health. The budget allocated for these operations totalled 262 million. They had a particularly significant impact in the housing and energy sectors. Following the changes in the governments in Yugoslavia and Serbia in October/November 2000, the Agency extended its activities to cover the whole of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It thus participated in an emergency assistance programme for Serbia worth 180 million.     Last updated: 05.12.2006  
act   Council Decision  2012/472/EU  of 26 April 2012 on the conclusion of the agreement between the United States of America and the European Union on the use and transfer of passenger name records to the United States Department of Homeland Security   summary   The goal of the agreement is to set a legal framework for the transfer of passenger name records (PNR) data by carriers operating passenger flights between the European Union and the United States to the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the subsequent use of that data by the US DHS.  The main purpose is to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute terrorist offences and related crimes, as well as other serious cross-border crimes punishable by a sentence of imprisonment of at least 3 years.  PNR data is the information voluntarily provided by passengers and collected by air carriers during the reservation and check-in procedures. It includes information such as name, dates of travel and travel itinerary, ticket information, contact information, payment /billing information, travel agent, seat number and baggage information.   Key points  of the EU-US PNR agreement are as follows:   The use of PNR data will be limited to the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences or transnational crime.   There will be a legally binding commitment from the US Department of Homeland Security to inform the Member States and EU authorities of any EU-relevant intelligence leads flowing from the analysis of these PNR data.   There will be a robust data protection regime with strong data security and integrity requirements.   Individuals will have the right to access their PNR data held in the United States and, if the information is inaccurate, it must be changed or removed.   There will be limited usage of PNR data for a period of 10 years for transnational crime and 15 years for terrorism. After 6 months personally identifiable information of PNR data will be masked out and after 5 years PNR data will be moved to a dormant database with additional controls.   background   PNR, which stands for passenger name record, is the information passengers provide to the airline or travel agent when booking a flight. This information has been used by law enforcement authorities around the world for many years to identify serious criminals and terrorists. It was used, for example, to get hold of the terrorists behind the planning of a suicide bombing in the subway in New York in 2009. It was also used after the 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai and to get hold of the plotter behind the planned attack in Times Square in 2010. This information is also an extremely important tool to identify drug smugglers.  The 2012 EU-US agreement on passenger name records (PNR) replaces the EU-US agreement of 2007.

summary of   Decision 2004/10/EC establishing the European Banking Committee   what is the aim of the decision  It sets up the  European Banking Committee (EBC),  an advisory committee which supports and advises the  European Commission  on policy issues relating to banking activities in the European Union (EU). The EBC is directly attached to the Commission and assists it in adopting implementing measures for EU directives and regulations.   key points    Role    The EBC is central to the preparation and implementation of European banking legislation.   It advises the Commission on policy issues concerning banking activities and issues opinions on the proposals it presents.    Composition    The EBC is composed of high-level representatives from EU countries, mostly from finance ministries.   The  European Central Bank  , the  European Banking Authority and  representatives from the  European Economic Area  and the European Free Trade Agreement countries may participate as  observers  .   The Commission may also invite other experts and observers (such as representatives from candidate countries) to attend meetings.    Rules of procedure   In 2014, the EBC amended its  rules of procedure  . These govern aspects such as:   calling meetings of the committee;   drawing up meeting agendas and the documentation to be sent to members;   keeping the  European Parliament  and the EU countries’ permanent representations (their embassies to the EU) informed;   voting procedures for EBC opinions;   membership of delegations to the EBC and the necessary quorum for its deliberations;   setting up working groups on particular issues;   admitting third parties, i.e. observers and experts.   The EBC replaced the former Banking Advisory Committee.   from when does the decision apply  It has applied since 13 April 2005 (the date on which Directive 2005/1/EC which, among other things, replaced the Banking Advisory Committee by the EBC, entered into force).   background   For more information on the EBC’s work, see:    European Banking Committee  on the European Commission’s website
   Geographical Indications and Designations of Origin     Geographical Indications and Designations of Origin     This Regulation establishes the rules for protecting designations of origin and geographical indications for agricultural products and foodstuffs intended for human consumption.     ACT     Council Regulation (EC) No       510/2006      of 20 March 2006 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs [       See amending act(s)      ].     SUMMARY     This Regulation sets out provisions on agricultural products and foodstuffs (excluding all wine-sector products, except wine vinegar) from a defined geographical area. If there is a link between the characteristics of certain products and their geographical origin, they may qualify for either a protected geographical indication (PGI)       *      or a protected designation of origin (PDO)       *      . The use of corresponding EU symbols on the labels of such products provides consumers with clear and concise information on their origin. The introduction of these two terms also benefits the rural economy, since it boosts farmers' income and maintains the population in less favoured or remote areas.      Designation of origin and geographical indication      The two types of geographical description are different. A PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) covers the term used to describe foodstuffs which are produced, processed and prepared in a given geographical area using recognised know-how (such as Mozzarella di Bufala Campana). A PGI indicates a link with the area in at least one of the stages of production, processing or preparation (such as Turrón de Alicante). The link with the area is therefore stronger for PDOs.      Names that have become generic      , i.e. those that, although linked to the place or region where the product was initially produced or sold, denote the common name of a product in the EU (such as Dijon mustard) may not be registered.      Names that conflict with the name of a plant variety or an animal breed      and as a result are likely to mislead the consumer as to the true origin of the product may not be registered.     A name wholly or partially       homonymous      with that of a name already registered under this Regulation must only be registered with due regard for local and traditional usage and the actual risk of confusion.     A PDO or PGI may not be registered where the reputation and the length of time it has been used are liable to mislead the consumer as to the true identity of the product.      Product specification      In order to obtain a PDO or PGI, agricultural products or foodstuffs must comply with the product specification, which must include the following aspects:      the name of the PDO or PGI;       the description of the product, with an indication of its main physical, chemical, microbiological and organoleptic properties;       definition of the geographical area;       information proving that the product originates from that area;       information justifying the link between the product and the geographical area;       description of the production method and, if appropriate, the authentic and unvarying local methods as well as information concerning packaging that takes place in the defined geographical area in order to safeguard quality, ensure the origin or ensure control;       the name and address of authorities or bodies that verify compliance with the provisions contained in the product specification;       any specific labelling rule for the product in question;       any requirements laid down by Community or national provisions.       Application for registration      Applications for registration may only be made by a group of producers or processors or, in exceptional cases, natural or legal persons. If the application concerns a cross-border area, it may be made jointly by several groups.     The application for registration must include:      the name and address of the applicant group;       the product specification;       a single document setting out the main aspects of the product specification and a description of the link between the product and its geographical area of origin.      Applications are made to the Member State on whose territory the geographical area is situated. The Member State examines it and initiates a national objection procedure, ensuring that the application is sufficiently publicised and allowing a reasonable period within which any natural or legal person having a legitimate interest and established or resident on its territory may lodge an objection. Where the Member State deems the application to be acceptable, it forwards the single document to the Commission together with a declaration stating that all the necessary conditions have been met.     Where an application for registration concerns a geographical area in a third country, it has to be sent to the Commission either directly or through the authorities of that country.      Examination by the Commission      The Commission checks that the application is justified and that it meets all the necessary conditions. This check must be carried out within twelve months. Each month, the Commission publishes the list of the names for which registration applications have been submitted. If the conditions are met, it publishes in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJ) the single document and the publication reference of the product specification. If the conditions are not met, the Commission will reject the application for registration.      Objections      Within six months from the date of publication in the OJ, any Member State, third country, natural or legal person having a legitimate interest may object to the registration proposed by lodging a duly substantiated statement. Proof must be given that either the product specification fails to meet the required conditions, or that the name conflicts with a trade mark or agricultural product or that it has become a generic name.     Where the Commission receives no admissible objection, it will register the name.     Where the Commission judges that an objection is admissible, it invites the interested parties to engage in the appropriate consultations. If they reach an agreement within six months, they notify the Commission of all the factors that enabled that agreement to be reached, including the opinions of the applicant and the objector. If no agreement is reached, the Commission takes a decision, bearing in mind traditional fair practice and the actual likelihood of confusion.      Names, indications and symbols      A registered name may be used by any operator marketing products conforming to the corresponding specification. The terms "protected designation of origin" and "protected geographical indication" or the associated EU symbols must be included on the labelling of products originating in the EU and may be included on those originating in third countries and sold under these designations.      Amending the product specification      A group may request the product specification to be amended to take into account technical or scientific developments or to revise the definition of the geographical area. Applications for amendments are made in accordance with procedures similar to those for registering a designation.      Official controls      Controls on the requirements set out in this Regulation are carried out under Regulation (EC) No       882/2004      . Verification of compliance of a product with its product specification may be ensured by one or more public authorities set up for this purpose or by one or more product certification bodies. For EU designations, the costs of such verification are to be borne by the operators subject to those controls.      Cancellation      If the Commission deems that compliance with the conditions laid down in the product specification for a protected designation is no longer ensured or if any natural or legal person with a legitimate interest requests cancellation of the registration, the Commission may initiate the procedure to cancel a registration.      Protection      Registered names are protected against:      any misuse, imitation or evocation, even if the true origin of the product is indicated or if the protected name is translated or accompanied by an expression such as "style", "type", "method", "as produced in", "imitation" or similar;       any other false or misleading indication as to the provenance, origin, nature or essential qualities of the product, on the inner or outer packaging, advertising material or documents relating to the product concerned, and the packing of the product in a container liable to convey a false impression as to its origin;       any other practice liable to mislead the consumer as to the true origin of the product;       commercial use of a registered name in respect of products not covered by the registration if they are comparable to the products registered under that name or if this use exploits the reputation of the protected name.       Relations between trade marks, designations of origin and geographical indications      Where a PDO or a PGI is registered, applications to register trade marks corresponding to one of the above situations and relating to the same class of product are refused if they are submitted after the date of submission of the registration application to the Commission.     In certain cases specified in the Regulation, a trade mark may co-exist with a geographical indication or a designation of origin.      Committee procedure      The Commission is assisted by the Standing Committee on Protected Geographical Indications and Protected Designations of Origin.      Fees      Member States may charge a fee to cover their costs, including those incurred in scrutinising applications for registration, statements of objection, applications for amendments and requests for cancellations under this Regulation.

act   Regulation (EC) No  1523/2007  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2007 banning the placing on the market and the import to, or export from, the Community of cat and dog fur, and products containing such fur.   summary   The Regulation bans the placing on the market and the import to or export from the European Union (EU) of cat and dog fur and products containing such fur.  The ban may exceptionally be subject to derogations by the Commission, for educational or taxidermy purposes.  By 31 December 2008, the Member States had to inform the Commission of the analytical methods they use to identify the species of origin of fur (e.g. MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry). The Commission may adopt measures establishing analytical methods to be used in this sphere.  By 31 December 2008, the Member States had to lay down appropriate penalties to ensure that the ban is complied with and notify those provisions to the Commission.  By 31 December 2010, the Commission had to report on the application of the Regulation.   Background   The Treaty does not allow the Community to legislate on the basis of ethical concerns. That is why the proposal is based on the possibility, confirmed by consistent Court of Justice case-law, of adopting measures aimed at preventing obstacles that may affect the functioning of the Internal Market, in this case in the fur trade sector.  Several Member States had in fact already taken measures to restrict trade in cat and dog fur on their territory, forcing professionals in this sector to comply with different obligations depending on the country.

act   Decision No  676/2002/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a regulatory framework for radio spectrum policy in the European Community (Radio Spectrum Decision).   summary   This decision seeks to coordinate policy within the EU on the availability of radio spectrum and technical conditions for its efficient use. It applies the allocation of radio and wireless communication frequencies, including GSM, third and fourth generation mobile communications (3G, 4G) for frequencies between  9 kHz and 3000 GHz relevant for the internal market  .  Actions under the decision take into account the work of international organisations, such as the  international telecommunication union  (ITU) in managing the radio spectrum and the  European conference of postal and telecommunications administrations  (CEPT), an intergovernmental organisation with 48 member countries.   Radio Spectrum Committee   Building also on the general principles contained in the radio spectrum policy programme adopted in 2012, the Radio Spectrum Committee assists the Commission in defining, developing and implementing EU radio spectrum policy. Chaired by the Commission, it comprises representatives of the member countries and examines proposals on technical measures to harmonise conditions for the availability and use of the radio spectrum.  It also issues opinions on the mandates transmitted by the Commission to the CEPT on the harmonisation of radio frequency allocation and availability of information relating to the use of the spectrum. The Commission’s draft measures, once approved by the committee and adopted by the Commission, are binding throughout the EU and have to be followed by Member States when granting rights to use spectrum.   Background   Radio frequencies are allocated by international bodies, particularly the  World Radiocommunication Conferences  (WRC) of the  ITU  and, in Europe, by the  CEPT  . Through this decision, the EU also assumes a role in ensuring the optimal use of the radio spectrum.

   Integration of concerns related to migration within the external policy     Integration of concerns related to migration within the external policy     1) OBJECTIVE     The purpose of the document is threefold: firstly, to put the migration issue back in its broader context, taking account of the driving forces of international migration, the specific case of people in need of protection and the effects of international migration on developing countries; secondly, to give an overview of the Community migration policy and how migration issues are being integrated in Community external cooperation programmes and policies; thirdly, to indicate the possible policy developments that could improve the Community contribution to a better management of migratory flows, including the curbing of illegal migration.     2) ACT     Commission Communication of 3.12.2002 to the Council and European Parliament: Integrating migration issues in the European Union's relations with third countries [       COM (2002) 703      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     3) SUMMARY     Migration is a major strategic priority for the European Union (EU). Migration is not to be seen only as a problem but as a positive factor for the growth and success of both the Union and the countries concerned.     On the basis of the Amsterdam Treaty and the priorities set out by the Tampere European Council, a Community policy on migration and asylum is gradually being put in place. The communication is an integral part of the overall approach and will be followed (March 2003) by another communication from the Commission on interactions between immigration, and the employment and social policies in the European Union.     Bearing in mind the problem of illegal immigration, the Seville European Council drew attention to the contribution which the EU's various external policies and instruments including the development policy, could make in addressing the underlying causes of migration flows. Thus the Council requested that immigration policy be incorporated into the Union's relations with third countries. The European Council also asked for a report on the effectiveness of financial resources available at Community level for repatriation of immigrants and rejected asylum seekers, for management of external borders, and for asylum and migration projects in third countries.     The communication was divided into the following two sections:      Part I: Migration and development       Partie II: Report on the effectiveness of financial resources available at Community level.      In integrating migration into the external policy of the Community, action must be based on the following four key principles:      The integration of migration aspects in the external action of the Community must respect the overall coherence of its external policies and actions, and must encourage those countries that cooperate rather than penalise those who are not willing to do so.       The long-term priority should be to address the root causes of migration flows, by poverty eradication, institution and capacity building and conflict prevention.       Migration aspects should be taken care of in the "Country and regional strategic document" which forms the basis of the EU programmes of assistance to third countries.       Extra funding will be needed. These resources should be used to finance specific, targeted actions in the field of migration; these actions should be complementary to those financed under the more generic budget development lines.       Migration and development       The EU and international migration flows       The net annual official inward migration rate of the EU is currently about 2.2‰. An important legal distinction is to be made between economic migrants and persons in need of protection. The number of illegal migrants in the EU can only be estimated.       The majority of "economic migrants" originate from middle income countries and economies in transition. Nationals from low income developing countries usually move to regional centres of economic growth. The facilitation of South-South migration could be a relevant aspect of Community development cooperation with certain countries.       The causes of migration       The conditions producing migration include factors such as: low economic growth , unequal income distribution, overpopulation closely linked to high population growth, high unemployment rates, armed conflict and ethnic cleansing, human rights abuses, persecution and natural disasters (ecological degradation in general) as well as poor governance.       Safety and socio-economic improvement in host countries are the major pull factors. Because of labour shortages in the highly skilled and low-skilled sectors, Europe-based companies increasingly turn to the labour market of developing countries to recruit these workers, who need practical advice and support.       Successful development processes may - in the short term - lead to an increase of international migration because a number of persons acquire the means to travel while satisfying opportunities at home may still be limited. This phenomenon - called the migration hump - should normally disappear at a later stage.       Host countries and refugees       Many developing countries have to deal with refugee populations exceeding by far EU averages. In 2002 there were 13 million refugees and asylum seekers world-wide, of which only 1.9 million (15 %) were in the EU. The number of asylum seekers arriving in the EU has halved over the last decade (currently less than 400 000 people per year).       The burden on host developing countries is exacerbated by the intrinsic limited financial and institutional capacities of these countries. The Community funds projects to provide humanitarian assistance for refugees needs and at the same time help the host country in managing the limited infrastructure and institutional capacity. Projects are also funded to assist repatriation to the country of origin.       Effects of migration on developing countries       International migration can contribute to the economic development of both the host country and the country of origin. For many developing countries remittances provide an important positive contribution to the balance of payments and are a major source of foreign exchange. The Commission considers that public administration in migrant-hosting countries may have a role to play in trying to ensure that these funds can be transmitted to developing countries by cheap, legal and secure means.       Increasing globalisation invites migration of specialised workers (brain drain). This phenomenon may have direct negative repercussions on the development process of the country of origin. For that reason the 6th RTD Framework programme, which offers training to scientists from third countries, in particular, developing countries, includes elements that promote the return of trainees. Voluntary return of migrants brings back accumulated amounts of financial, human and social capital into developing countries.       Community migration policy      : The Commission has formulated the main components of a common policy on migration and asylum in two general communications and in individual proposals, which cover the following areas:      Establishing the basic framework for the admission and conditions of stay of legal migrants and their families (         family reunification        , for example);       Facilitating the mobility of third country nationals within the EU (i.e. for long-term residents or for third country nationals who are students);       Reinforcing the         fight against illegal migration        ;       Improving cooperation on the return of illegal migrants.       Assistance to third countries directly related to migration management      Migration is a new field of action for Community development and cooperation programmes. Most of the Community programmes concerned will be implemented during the period 2002-2004. The main regional orientations can be summarised as follows:      Mediterranean region: in         MEDA        , the Justice and Home Affairs regional programme addresses the general issues of combating organised crime including criminal networks involved in smuggling migrants and trafficking human beings. With regard to migration, in particular, illegal immigration, the programme covers police and judicial training and the establishment of a Euromed network of data collection and research on migratory phenomena.       The Western Balkans: the aim of the         CARDS programme        is to foster regional cooperation inter alia in the field of Justice and Home Affairs. In view of their porous borders and weak infrastructure, cooperation on migration issues is of particular importance.       Eastern Europe and Central Asia: the current         TACIS        Regional Justice and Home Affairs Programme is focusing on three key areas: first, the development of a comprehensive border management, migration and asylum system; second, combating drug trafficking involving Afghanistan; third the establishment of effective anti-corruption measures in partner states. The new TACIS Programme for Central Asia will include cooperation on migration and related issues (for example, improvement of border management capacities).       Asia: a dialogue on immigration has already started within the ASEM framework (Asia-Europe contacts).       Latin America: the Commission has started to explore ways to develop a dialogue on migration between the two regions.       ACP countries (the countries of sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific): the         Cotonou agreement        contains specific provisions on cooperation on migration and in particular preventing and the combating illegal immigration. An in-depth dialogue on migration is taking place in the context of the ACP-EU partnership and ACP-EC Council of Ministers.       Relief and rehabilitation      : the important       link between relief, rehabilitation and development      merits special attention. Several programmes which provide support for uprooted people are already being implemented or prepared (for example CARDS).      The root causes of migratory flows      : So that the Community development policy can contribute to addressing the root causes of migratory flows, the Community development policy must focus on poverty reduction. In this context, the priority areas of the Community development policy are as follows:      Trade and Development in order to reduce unemployment and make up for the absence of economic prospects. The Community must continue to promote the improvement of effective market access of developing countries' products into the EU, as well as the integration of the developing countries in the world trading system etc.;       Conflict prevention and regional integration and cooperation;       Institutional capacity building and good governance (for example institutional reform; supporting dialogue between state and opposition groups; reform of the electoral system etc.);       Food security and sustainable rural development: development policies that contribute to food security and access to food and drinking water will limit "survival" migration by poor people. In a wider context, development policy aimed at sustainable rural development will reduce the number of people moving from the rural areas to the cities.       Policy developments       Political dialogue and migration clause      : Within the context of Association or Cooperation Agreements, the European Union will systematically put the migration-development nexus on the agenda of its political dialogue. Other issues such as the root causes of migration, the fight against illegal immigration, facilitation of return, better integration of legal migrants, facilitation of brain circulation and how to assist persons who wish to contribute to the development process of their country of origin etc. should also be addressed.      Skilled labour      : since the "brain drain" can have negative effects on the development of third countries, an attempt should be made to increase the number of financially attractive local job opportunities (for example, the Community could offer jobs currently taken by expatriate staff to local people).      Readmission agreements      : The Community signed a readmission agreement with Hong Kong in November 2002 and the negotiation of other agreements is planned. These agreements should fit into a broader political cooperation and planning dialogue with third countries. This dialogue should use the "leverage" provided by incentives (for example on a country by country basis, preferential tariffs, more development aid, a more generous visa policy, and an increase in the quotas of migrant workers of the countries in question) thereby ensuring the cooperation of third countries in the negotiation and conclusion of readmission agreements with the European Community. Specific Community support for the preparation and implementation of readmission agreements by third countries should aim at increasing institutional capacities and technical assistance.      Mid-term review      : The mid-term review of Country and Regional Strategy Papers (which should begin in 2003) will make it possible, on a country by country basis, to examine the extent to which greater priority should be given to specific programmes relating to migration. This could lead to a readjustment of the external actions of the Community to give greater weight to migration policy and related issues. But the issue of migration also touches on other developments in Community policies, in particular in the trade area after Doha, in sustainable development after Johannesburg, or on crime and terrorism.      Part II      : Report on the effectiveness of financial resources available at Community level: In the second part of the communication, the Commission evaluates how effective the financial resources available at Community level are in addressing problems relating to migration. The Commission considers that the scope of this examination can be usefully extended to cover not only financial instruments already applied but the instruments currently contemplated under the common policies on asylum and immigration.     Although regular and significant increases have been made in funds since the expenditure was first allocated to the asylum and immigration policies, the forthcoming review of the       financial perspective      will necessitate a readjustment to take into account requirements flowing from genuine common immigration and asylum policies.      4) implementing measures       5) follow-up work      Last updated: 03.12.2007

Updated by:     Progress Report of 29 November 2002 on the Communication from the Commission on the impact of enlargement on regions bordering candidate countries - Community action for border regions [       COM(2002)660      final].     SUMMARY      The challenge of the enlargement of the EU      , foreseen for 1 May 2004, with eight central and eastern European countries (Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Slovenia) and two Mediterranean countries (Cyprus and Malta) is unprecedented in the history of the EU. Over and above the purely economic considerations, the success of enlargement depends to a large extent on the support of present and future European citizens.     Within the framework of the accession partnership and the adoption of the Community       acquis      , the EU is providing important financial and technical assistance, helping the future Member States in implementing deep structural reforms. The agreement on agricultural and regional policy reached in December 2002 at the Copenhagen European Council allowed to provisionally close the accession negotiations and lay down financial assistance for these countries until the end of 2006.     The economic gap between the existing and the future Member States is considerable. This is especially visible along large parts of the EU's border with candidate countries. Particular attention needs to be paid to these areas in order to turn the challenge of enlargement into a real opportunity of socio-economic development. Reinforcing information and communication measures is a good means of attaining such an objective.      THE ECONOMIC SITUATION OF BORDER REGIONS      The border regions concerned are defined as regions at       NUTS II level      , bordering the acceding countries by land or sea and situated around NUTS III regions involved in cross-border programmes under the       INTERREG III A      Community Initiative in the period 2000-2006. The EU counts 23 such border regions:      two in Finland: Uusimaa, Etelä-Suomi;       eight in Germany: Niederbayern, Oberpfalz, Oberfranken, Brandenburg, Berlin, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Chemnitz, Dresden;       six in Austria: Burgenland, Niederösterreich, Wien, Kärnten, Steiermark, Oberösterreich;       two in Italy: Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia;       five in Greece: Anatoliki Makedonia - Thraki, Kentriki Makedonia, Aegean Islands (North), Aegean Islands (South), and Crete.      There are important disparities between these regions, mainly regarding the economic development, the employment rate, the infrastructure, the level of education, or the share of the gross domestic product (GDP) devoted to research. While the per capita income is relatively high in Italy, Finland, most Austrian regions and Bavaria, it is lower than 75% of the EU average in the new German Länder, Greece and Austria's Burgenland. Compared to the whole EU, the group of these 23 border regions nevertheless attains the present EU's average development level and employment rate. Per capita income and productivity are also higher in these regions than in the neighbouring regions of the acceding countries, except for Bratislava. The       Second Progress Report      on economic and social cohesion provides an important insight into the particular socio-economic situation of border regions.      Existing Community policies      For the 2000-06 period, the border regions of acceding countries will benefit from several forms of Community financial assistance through:      the Cohesion and Structural Funds;The new German Länder, all the Greek regions and Burgenland are eligible for         Objective 1        (assistance to regions whose economic development is lagging behind). Several areas adjacent to candidate countries in Germany, Austria, Italy and Finland receive assistance under         Objective 2        and partially under         Objective 3        . The INTERREG III Community initiative grants European assistance for cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation. Additionally, the three other Community Initiatives (         LEADER+        for rural development,         EQUAL        for equality in the labour market and         URBAN II        for urban areas) are important sources of support.       pre-accession assistance for candidate countries;Similar to the Structural Funds, the pre-accession assistance includes the financial instruments         ISPA        and         Sapard        and the         Phare programme        . Phare also provides specific support to         cross-border cooperation        (Phare-CBC) between geographical areas at NUTS III level situated on both sides of the border.       State aid for regional purposes The majority of the NUTS III regions bordering accession countries qualify for state aid for regional purposes, except for four: Wiener Umland Nord and Süd in Austria and Neustadt a/d Waldnaab and Schwandorf in Germany. This state aid helps businesses in the border regions to cope with the special problems of the enlargement process. Furthermore, under the present state aid rules, a substantial complementary assistance is offered to Member States.       Trans-European networks in transport, energy and telecommunication;       the loans of the European Investment Bank (EIB);These loans are meant to support environmental and transport infrastructure projects.       other Community programmes in the area of education, training, youth and environment.       Effects of enlargement in border regions      Since the transition process started in 1990, the border regions have already benefited from their geographical proximity to the EU. The relatively well-developed infrastructure and low labour costs have contributed to stimulating markets, investments and tourism in these areas.     The income gap between the EU and the accession countries has led to fears of large migration flows into the EU. In the light of the studies carried out and the experience of the accession of Spain and Portugal in 1986, the migration from the future Member States towards the EU should not exceed 1% of the present European population and the negative impact on wage levels is rather modest. Furthermore, the accession negotiations have established a series of measures (including a transition period, a review mechanism, safeguards and declarations of the Member States), which progressively introduce free movement of workers over 5-7 years. Immigration may even help to limit the adverse effects of ageing populations and to overcome labour shortages in some sectors.     The daily cross-border migrations vary considerably from one border region to the other, ranging from 1 to 8% of labour in different regions. Cross-border commuting affects mainly Germany and Austria. In the first case, it is mainly focused along the border of Bavaria with the Czech Republic. As for the second, Austria shares borders with four candidate countries (Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Slovenia) and its main economic centres (Vienna, Graz and Linz) are located close to these borders.     With regard to economic integration, the competitive pressure generally associated with enlargement is already noticeable since the EU has lifted most customs duties and quantitative restrictions in trade in agricultural and industrial products from candidate countries. In general, capital-intensive and technologically advanced sectors in the border regions are likely to benefit from enlargement, while labour-intensive sectors (agriculture, heavy industry) are likely to face competition from cheaper labour coming from acceding countries.      COMMUNITY ACTION FOR BORDER REGIONS      The Commission estimates that the measures taken for all the EU regions need to be complemented by other action to contribute to better economic integration. Instead of creating a new specific instrument, a combination of new and improved existing measures will be most effective in addressing the specific needs of border regions. Moreover, the focus should be placed on providing better information on the objectives and benefits of enlargement.     The new measures aim to provide specific additional funding to border regions, worth a total of EUR 305 million. These measures are the following:      EUR 150 million to support the trans-European transport network (TEN-T);The relevant         Financial Regulation        regarding TEN projects currently limits Community contributions to a maximum of 10% of the total project cost, causing a problem for acceding countries with limited resources. For the cross-border projects aimed at eliminating mainly rail bottlenecks, the Commission proposes raising the existing 10% threshold to 20%. In order to complement the ISPA assistance for acceding countries, the Commission decided to allocate additional assistance of EUR 100 million to the Member States for the 2003-06 period, and EUR 50 million from existing funds not already committed.       Developing a municipal infrastructure facility in co-operation with the EIB to support small-scale municipal infrastructure projects in the social and economic sectors.First focused on Poland, this assistance will ultimately cover all the acceding countries. EUR 35 million for 2002 and EUR 15 million for 2003 is allocated under the Phare programme.       Additional assistance of EUR 50 million under INTERREG III;A special support of EUR 30 million to border regions derives from the flexibility instrument and addresses 13 INTERREG III programmes covering regions bordering on the future Member States, and the Strand B INTERREG III programme for the Baltic Sea Region. Furthermore, the creation of networks (e.g. INTERACT), information activities and the technical assistance to project development benefit from additional assistance of EUR 20 million.       An additional amount of EUR 45 million for the competitivity of the regions and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);Initiated by the European Parliament, the budget line (Pilot project on the impact of enlargement for the regions bordering the candidate countries) granted support of EUR 30 million to the ARGE project, which is a network of 28 chambers of commerce located in the EU regions bordering the acceding countries. The aim of this project is to strengthen the competitiveness of labour-intensive enterprises in three areas: information, implementing a development strategy and cross-border cooperation.In addition, the Commission has published three calls for proposals, for a total amount of EUR 15 million. These aim to encourage cross-border cooperation and are meant to support the         Euro-Info Centres        , trade unions, regional and local authorities.       Additional measures in favour of young people;EUR 10 million has been additionally allocated to the YOUTH programme for the 2003-2006 period. The national agencies which manage the programme in a decentralised manner are invited to present cross-border cooperation plans with a view to encourage mobility, initiative, intercultural learning and solidarity among young people from the present and future Member States.      In addition to these measures providing additional funding, the action plan of the Commission proposes a better co-ordination of existing policies. The aim of this action plan is to strengthen the coherence and efficiency of Community policies with an important impact on border regions:      To improve the co-ordination between Phare-CBC and INTERREG;On 6 September 2002, the Commission amended the Phare-CBC Regulation to make it more consistent with INTERREG III, namely regarding the eligibility of actions. This amendment is applicable for Phare 2003 programming. On the same date, the Commission adapted the Phare Guidelines 2003-06 in order to enable acceding countries to use their Phare funds for participating in the INTERREG programmes.Under the territorial principle, the Commission has drawn the conclusion that the current legislative framework clearly rules out the use of Structural Funds resources - and namely those available for INTERREG - for investment projects, e.g. sewage plants, bridges, technology centres, outside the territory of the European Union. A less rigid interpretation of the territorial principle is however feasible in the following cases: to finance expenses for participants from non-Community countries at meetings of the monitoring committees and subcommittees from the technical assistance budget according to         Regulation No 1685/2000        on eligible costs; to reimburse the same expenses (travel and subsistence expenses, seminars, work placements, language courses) for the strand A projects of INTERREG III, except for the investment projects; to purchase services or equipment from partner countries, in accordance with EC public procurement law.In view of its geographical position in close proximity to four acceding countries, Vienna is now eligible for INTERREG III A programmes with Hungary and the Czech Republic [Official Journal C 239 of 25.9.2001].       Policy initiatives in the agricultural sector;To improve the competitiveness and diversification of economic activities, the border regions can re-orient their rural development programmes in the light of the mid-term evaluations foreseen for the end of 2003.The implementation of the "trans-national co-operation" strand of the LEADER + Community Initiative regarding rural development is effective and includes the participation of acceding countries.      The floods of summer 2002 in Eastern Europe caused serious human and material damage in certain border regions in Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic. To be able to respond immediately to the needs of those suffering a disaster, the European Union has established the       European Union Solidarity Fund      , for which the annual allocation amounts to EUR 1 billion. In 2003, it will support the above regions. It is not limited geographically, but by the nature and size of the disaster.

summary of   Treaty establishing the European Economic Community  (EEC Treaty)   what was the aim of the treaty   It set up the European Economic Community (EEC) which brought together 6 countries (Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) to work towards integration and economic growth, through trade.   It created a  common market  based on the free movement of:   goods   people   services   capital.     It was signed in parallel with a second treaty which set up the  European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom)  .   The Treaty of Rome has been amended on a number of occasions, and today it is called the  Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union  .   key points    Aims    The aim of the EEC and the common market was to:   transform the conditions of trade and production on the territory of its 6 members and   serve as a step towards the closer political unification of Europe.      Specific goals   The signatories agreed to:   lay the foundations of an ‘ever closer union’ among the peoples of Europe   ensure the economic and social progress of their countries by joint action to eliminate trade and other barriers between them;   improve their citizens’ living and working conditions;   ensure balanced trade and fair competition;   reduce the economic and social differences between the EEC’s various regions;   gradually abolish restrictions on international trade through a  common trade policy  ;   abide by the principles of the  UN charter  ;   pool their resources to preserve and strengthen peace and liberty and call on other peoples of Europe who share this ideal to join them in these efforts.    Common market   The treaty:   establishes a common market, in which the signatory countries agree to gradually align their  economic policies  ;   creates a single economic area with free  competition  between companies. It lays the basis for approximating the conditions governing trade in products and services over and above those already covered by the other treaties (  European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC)  and Euratom);   broadly prohibits restrictive agreements and  government subsidies  which can affect trade between the 6 countries;   includes the 6 members’  overseas countries and territories  in these arrangements and the customs union, to promote their economic and social development.    Customs union    The treaty abolished quotas (i.e. ceilings on imports) and customs duties between its 6 signatories.   It established a  common external tariff on imports from outside the EEC  , replacing the previous tariffs of the different states.   The customs union was accompanied by a common trade policy. This policy, managed at EEC level and no longer at national level, distinguishes the customs union from a mere free-trade association.    Joint policies    The treaty established certain policies from the start as joint policies among the member countries, including:    common agricultural policy  (Articles 38 to 47)   common trade policy (Articles 110 to 116)    transport policy  (Articles 74 to 84).     It allowed for the creation of other joint policies, should the need arise. After 1972, the EEC established joint action in the fields of  environmental  ,  regional  ,  social  and  industrial policy  .   These policies were accompanied by the creation of:   a  European Social Fund  , to improve job opportunities for workers and to raise their standard of living   a  European Investment Bank (EIB)  , to facilitate the EEC’s economic expansion by creating investment funding.      Institutions    The treaty established institutions and decision-making mechanisms which make it possible to express both national interests and a joint vision.   The main institutions were:   the  Council of Ministers  ,   the  Commission  ,   the Parliamentary Assembly (later to become the  European Parliament  ),   the  Court of Justice  .     The first 3 are advised in the decision-making process by the  Economic and Social Committee  .   from when did the treaty apply  Signed on 25 March 1957, it applied from 1 January 1958.   background   For further information, see:    The First Treaties   (European Parliament)     EU history   (European Council)     EU treaties   (European Commission)     Treaties overview   (EUR-Lex)  .
act   Regulation (EC) No  552/2004  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 on the interoperability of the European Air Traffic Management network (the interoperability Regulation) [  See amending act(s)  ].   summary   The regulation forms part of a package of legislation on air traffic management aimed at the creation of a  single European sky  as from 31 December 2004. This objective will enable optimum use to be made of European airspace, which will help to reduce delays and boost growth in air transport.  The aim of this regulation is to define common requirements to guarantee interoperability between the various air traffic management systems used. It establishes a harmonised system of certification for components and systems.  The aim of the regulation is two-fold:   to achieve interoperability between the different systems, constituents and associated procedures in the European air traffic management network;   to ensure the introduction of new agreed and validated concepts of operations and technology in air traffic management.    Essential requirements   The European air traffic management network, its systems and their constituents must meet essential requirements. These are of two kinds:   general requirements: seamless operation , support for new concepts of operation, safety, civil/military coordination, environmental constraints, principles governing the logical architecture of systems and principles governing the construction of systems;   specific requirements: systems and procedures for airspace management, systems and procedures for air traffic flow management, systems and procedures for air traffic services, communications systems and procedures for ground-to-ground, air-to-ground and air-to-air communications, navigation procedures, surveillance systems and procedures, systems and procedures for aeronautical information services and for the use of meteorological information.    Implementing rules for interoperability   The implementing rules for interoperability must in particular:   determine any specific requirements, in particular in terms of safety;   describe, where appropriate, any specific requirements, in particular regarding the coordinated introduction of new concepts of operation;   describe the specific conformity assessment procedures involving notified bodies to be used to assess the conformity or suitability for use of constituents, as well as for the verification of systems;   specify the conditions of implementation including, where appropriate, the date by which all relevant stakeholders are required to comply with them.    Community specifications   These specification may be:   European standards for systems or constituents, together with the relevant procedures, drawn up by the European standardisation bodies; or   specifications drawn up by  Eurocontrol  on matters of operational coordination between air navigation service providers.    EC declaration of conformity or suitability for use of components   Constituents must be accompanied by a European Community (EC) declaration of conformity or suitability for use. Before a system is put into service, the relevant air navigation service provider must establish an EC declaration of verification, confirming compliance, and must submit it to the national supervisory authority together with a technical file.   Safeguards   Where the national supervisory authority ascertains that a constituent or a system accompanied by an EC declaration of conformity/verification does not comply with the essential requirements for interoperability, it must restrict the application of the constituent or prohibit its use. The EU country concerned must immediately inform the Commission of any such measures, indicating the reasons for it.  Where the Commission establishes that the measures taken by the supervisory authority are not justified, it will request the EU country concerned to ensure that they are withdrawn without delay.   Transitional arrangements   Starting from 20 October 2005, the essential requirements will apply to the putting into service of systems and constituents of the European air traffic management network.  Compliance with the essential requirements will be required for all systems and constituents of the European air traffic management network currently in operation by 20 April 2011.

The consent must be a clear affirmative action by the individual.      Individuals      (known as ‘data subjects’ in the legislation) have the right to:      withdraw their consent at any time, which should be as easy as giving it;       know whether or not their personal data is being processed and to have access to it;       ensure the correction of any inaccurate personal data;       remove or restrict any personal data from processing provided certain conditions are met;       receive their personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format;       object, because of their particular situation, to the use of their personal data for public-interest purposes;       not be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, which has legal consequences for them;       complain to the EDPS if they feel their personal data is being processed in a way that violates the regulation;       be compensated for any material or non-material damage they suffer because of the actions of an EU institution, body, office or agency;       mandate a not-for-profit organisation to lodge a complaint with the EDPS.       Controllers      :      have to inform individuals, in plain language and with factual information, such as contact details and the aim of the exercise, when personal data is collected;       must reply to any request from a data subject, such as access to their personal data or their rectification or correction of its contents, as soon as possible and no later than 1 month;       apply appropriate technical and organisational measures, including pseudonymisation         *        , to ensure that processing of personal data complies with the regulation;       must only use data processors that meet EU requirements;       keep a detailed record of data processing under their responsibility;       cooperate with the EDPS;       notify the EDPS and the individual concerned as soon as possible of any personal data breach;       assess the impact of new processing technologies on the protection of personal data;       ensure the confidentiality and security of their electronic communication networks;       inform the EDPS when drawing up administrative measures or internal rules on the processing of personal data.      The legislation creates an EDPS position, appointed for a once-renewable 5-year term of office. Based in Brussels, the holder of the post:      acts with complete independence;       treats all confidential information with professional secrecy;       monitors how EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies apply the legislation;       promotes public understanding and awareness of the processing of personal data;       handles complaints and conducts investigations;       warns and sanctions data controllers;       refers issues to the Court of Justice, which handles any disputes over the legislation;       submits an annual report to the         European Parliament        , the         Council        and the         European Commission        ;       cooperates with national data protection supervisory authorities.       EDPS rules of procedure      A       decision      of 15 May 2020 adopts the rules of procedure of the EDPS. It lays down in detail:      the EDPS’s mission, guiding principles and organisation;       how it will monitor and ensure the application of the regulation;       procedures for its legislative consultation, technology monitoring, research projects and court proceedings; and       procedures for cooperation with national supervisory authorities and international cooperation.       Special rules for EU bodies, offices and agencies       Special rules      apply to EU bodies, offices and agencies that process operational personal data       *      for the purposes of law enforcement (e.g.       Eurojust      ). They are covered by a specific chapter in the regulation. The rules in this chapter are aligned with the LED. Moreover, in the founding acts of these bodies, offices and agencies, more specific rules can be laid down to take into account their particular characteristics.       Europol      and the       European Public Prosecutor’s Office      are excluded from the regulation. The Commission will review the legislative framework for EU bodies, offices and agencies that process operational data for the purposes of law enforcement by April 2022.      Data protection officers      Controllers also appoint a       data protection officer      for a 3- to 5-year term to:      give independent advice on personal data processing;       monitor compliance with the data protection rules.       Reports      The Commission must report to the European Parliament and to the Council no later than 30 April 2022 – and every 5 years thereafter – on how the legislation is being applied.     FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?     It has applied since 11 December 2018, except with regard to the processing of personal data by Eurojust, where it has applied from 12 December 2019.     BACKGROUND      Article 8      of the       Charter of Fundamental Rights      states that everyone has the right to personal data protection.       Article 16      of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU further develops that right. This article is the legal basis for any EU legislation on data protection.     For more information, see:       Data protection in the EU        (         European Commission        ).      KEY TERMS      Personal data:      any information on an identified or identifiable individual.      Controller:      any EU institution, body, office or agency, or its organisational entity, that determines the means and purposes of processing personal data.

   Croatia - Internal market     Croatia - Internal market     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM(2010) 660      final – SEC(2010) 1326 - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The       2010 Report      presents the improvements made in terms of the free movement of goods, workers, services and capital. These improvements have particularly taken place in coordinating social security systems, the recognition of vocational qualifications, postal services and the protection of intellectual property. Effort is required with regard to product safety, security of payment systems and combating money laundering. Progress has also been made in the development of the Customs Union.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission’s words)      The principle of the       free movement of goods      implies that products must be traded freely from one part of the Union to another. In a number of sectors, this general principle is complemented by a harmonised regulatory framework, following the "old approach" (imposing precise product specifications) or the "new approach" (imposing general product requirements). The harmonised European product legislation, which has to be transposed, represents the largest part of the       acquis      under this chapter. In addition, sufficient administrative capacity to notify the restrictions to trade and to apply horizontal and procedural measures in areas such as standardisation, certification, accreditation, metrology and market surveillance is essential.     The       acquis      in respect of the       free movement of workers      states that citizens of an EU Member State have the right to work in another Member State. EU migrant workers must be treated in the same manner as national workers with regard to working conditions, social benefits and tax allowances. The       acquis      also provides a mechanism for coordinating national social security provisions for those tax contributors and their families who move to another Member State.     Member States are required to remove all restrictions with regard to the       free movement of services      . Member States must ensure that the right of establishment and the freedom to provide services anywhere in the EU is not hampered by national legislation. In some sectors, the       acquis      prescribes harmonised rules which must be respected if the internal market is to function; this concerns mainly the financial sector (banking, insurance, investment services and securities markets). Financial institutions may carry out their activities throughout the European Union according to the principle of ‘home country control’ by opening branches or by providing cross-border services. The       acquis      also provides harmonised rules for some specific professions (craftsmen, traders, farmers, commercial agents), for certain information society services, and matters relating to personal data protection.     Member States must remove all restrictions on the       free movement of capital      between themselves, within the European Union, but also with third countries (with some exceptions) and adopt EU rules applicable to cross-border payments and to credit transfers concerning transferable securities. The money laundering and financing of terrorism directives require banks and other economic operators to identify their clients and be aware of certain operations, particularly in the case of cash transactions for high-value items. In order to tackle financial crime, it is essential that administrative and enforcement capacities are put in place, particularly by establishing cooperation between those authorities responsible for surveillance, implementing law and carrying out criminal proceedings.     The       acquis      on       public procurement      covers the general principles of transparency, equal treatment, free competition and non-discrimination. In addition, specific Community rules apply to the coordination and granting of public works, supplies and services contracts for traditional contracting entities and specific sectors. The       acquis      also defines the rules relating to the court procedures and means of action available. Its implementation requires specialised bodies.     The       acquis      relating to       intellectual property      rights defines the harmonised rules for the legal protection of copyright and related rights. Specific provisions are applicable to the protection of databases, data processing programmes, topographies of semi-conductors, satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission. In the field of intellectual property rights, the       acquis      details harmonised rules for the legal protection of trademarks and designs. Other specific provisions apply to biotechnological inventions and to pharmaceutical and phytopharmaceutical products. The       acquis      also establishes a Community trademark system and a Community design system.     The       acquis      on       company law      includes rules applicable to the constitution, registration, merger and division of companies. In the field of financial information, the       acquis      specifies the rules to be complied with regarding the presentation of consolidated annual accounts and provides simplified rules for small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular. The application of international accounting standards is obligatory for certain entities of public interest. Furthermore, the       acquis      also includes provisions relating to the approval, professional integrity and independence of persons responsible for legal controls.     The       Customs union       acquis      consists almost exclusively of legislation which is directly binding on the Member States. It includes the Community's Customs Code and its implementing provisions; the Combined Nomenclature, Common Customs Tariff and provisions on tariff classification, customs duty relief, duty suspensions and certain tariff quotas; and other provisions such as those on customs control of counterfeit and pirated goods, drugs precursors and the export of cultural goods and on mutual administrative assistance in customs matters and transit. Member States must also have the required implementing capacities, particularly connectivity with the EU’s computerised customs systems. Customs authorities must also have sufficient capacity for implementation and compliance with the specific provisions established in related fields of the       acquis      , such as foreign trade.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      Good progress has been made in the field of       free movement of goods      and alignment with the acquis in this chapter is well advanced. However, further efforts are necessary, particularly on conformity assessment, metrology and market surveillance. Croatia needs to complete alignment with the acquis and to strengthen implementation capacity.     Good progress can be reported in the area of       free movement of workers      , and a satisfactory level of legal alignment has been achieved. Additional efforts are needed to strengthen, in particular, the coordination of social security systems.     Progress has been made in the field of       right of establishment      and       freedom to provide services      , in particular on mutual recognition of professional qualifications and on postal services. Overall alignment with the acquis is satisfactory. Increased efforts are required to complete alignment, in particular in the area of mutual recognition of professional qualifications and to transpose the Services Directive. Work on improving administrative capacity needs to be continued.     Further progress has been made in aligning with the acquis in the field of       free movement of capital      . Continued efforts are needed to complete liberalisation of capital movements and to consolidate the enforcement of anti-money laundering legislation.     Good progress has been made with regard to       customs union      . Croatia's customs legislation is aligned with the acquis to a very large extent. Croatia has continued to make progress in the area of IT, notably in interconnectivity. Further progress towards removing the last discrepancies in Croatia's legislation, implementing the Anti-Corruption Strategy and preparing for IT interconnectivity is required.

Commission Report [         COM(2008) 674        final – SEC(2008) 2694 final – Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2008 report highlighted the progress made in the free movement of goods and capital. Freedom of movement for workers was however not yet in line with the Union rules on access to the labour market, whilst obstacles still hampered the right of establishment and freedom to provide services.      Commission Report [         COM(2007) 663        final - SEC(2007) 1431 - Not published in the Official Journal].      In its 2007 report, the Commission noted some progress with regard to the free movement of goods, workers, capital and services, and the right of establishment. It advised that efforts to align legislation with the       acquis      should be continued.      Commission Report [         COM(2006) 649        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2006 report stated that limited progress had been made with regard to customs union, public procurement, right of establishment, financial services, intellectual property and the free movement of capital. Croatia would need to invest a lot more effort into aligning its legislation with the Community       acquis      on the free movement of goods, workers, services and capital.      Commission Report [         COM(2005) 561        final – SEC(2005) 1424 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The 2005 report pointed out that, in spite of the efforts made in 2004, there were still several barriers to the free movement of goods in Croatia. There had been very limited progress as regards the free movement of workers, services and capital.      Commission Opinion [         COM(2004) 257        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      In its 2004 report, the Commission pointed out that the key elements of the Community       acquis      covering the free movement of goods were not yet in place. Considerable delays had been noted with respect to the free movement of workers. The Commission considered additional efforts to be urgently required in the area of the free movement of services and capital.

summary of   Directive 99/70/EC — the framework agreement on fixed-term work concluded by ETUC, UNICE and CEEP (trade unions)   what is the aim of the directive   It sets minimum requirements relating to fixed-term work, in order to ensure equal treatment of workers and to prevent abuse arising from the use of successive employment contracts or relationships of this type.   It calls on European Union (EU) countries to lay down penalties for infringements of these requirements.   It stipulates special clauses to limit the administrative burdens which could ensue for SMEs from the application of these new standards.   key points   It covers only working conditions for fixed-term employees; statutory social security schemes are the prerogative of the EU countries.  It concerns fixed-term workers (including seasonal workers) with the exception of workers placed at the disposal of a user undertaking by a temporary employment agency. However, the parties intend to adopt a similar agreement to cover temporary employment.  Moreover, EU countries may provide that this agreement does not apply to:   initial vocational training relationships and apprenticeship schemes;   employment contracts and relationships which have been concluded within the framework of a specific public or publicly-supported training, integration and vocational retraining programme.    The principle of non-discrimination   The agreement forbids employers to treat fixed-term workers in a less favourable manner than permanent workers solely because they have a fixed-term contract, unless the difference in treatment can be justified on objective grounds.  The agreement aims to improve the quality of fixed-term work by ensuring application of the principle of non-discrimination, and to prevent abuse arising from the use of successive fixed-term employment contracts or relationships.   Preventing the abuse of fixed-term work   To prevent abuse arising from the use of successive fixed-term employment contracts or relationships, EU countries, after consultation with the social partners, must introduce one or more of the following measures (taking account of the needs of specific sectors and categories of workers):   objective reasons justifying the renewal of such contracts or relationships;   the maximum total duration of successive fixed-term employment contracts and relationships;   the number of renewals.    Training opportunities   As far as possible, employers should facilitate access by fixed-term workers to training opportunities to enhance their skills, career development and occupational mobility.   Workers’ representatives   Fixed-term workers must be taken into consideration in calculating the threshold above which workers’ representative bodies may be constituted.   Penalties for infringements by employers   EU countries must determine the penalties applicable for infringements of national implementing provisions.   Fixed-term work and SMEs   Regarding the application of the directive to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), special care has been taken to avoid imposing administrative, financial and legal constraints in a way which would hold back their development. According to the  European Commission  , several clauses of the agreement refer to national laws, collective agreements or practice and/or to the social partners regarding the arrangements for their application, allowing the special needs of SMEs to be taken into account.   Application   EU countries were to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this directive by 10 July 2001 at the latest, or were to ensure that the social partners hadput the necessary measures into place by this date at the latest. EU countries could have a maximum of one more year to take account of special difficulties or implementation by a collective agreement. The Commission, however, had to be made aware of the circumstances.  Implementation of this directive cannot justify any reduction in the general level of protection afforded to workers in the field of the directive. EU countries may, however, introduce more favourable provisions than those set out in the directive.   Reports   Two Commission implementation reports present the national implementation measures of the directive (see Related documents section below).  These reports are complemented by two studies (  Implementation Report  on Directive 1999/70/EC concerning the Framework Agreement on fixed-term work concluded by UNICE, CEEP and ETUC (Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia) (March 2007) and Reports (Executive Summaries) on the implementation of Directive 1999/70/EC in  Bulgaria  and in  Romania  (2009).   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 10 July 1999. EU countries had to incorporate it in national law by 10 July 2001.   background   Fixed-term employment contracts were the subject of a Commission  proposal  for a Council directive. The  European Parliament  delivered its opinion on the proposal on 24 October 1990 (  Official Journal  C 295, 26.11.1990).  In the absence of agreement in the  Council  , the Commission decided to consult the social partners under Article 3 of the Agreement on Social Policy. During the first consultation, the social partners stressed the need to combat discrimination of workers affected by new, flexible forms of work.  At the end of the second round of consultation, the social partners decided to begin negotiations in this area.  In parallel, on 19 June 1996, the UNICE (now  BusinessEurope  ), the  CEEP  and the  ETUC  concluded a framework agreement on part-time work, implemented by  Directive 97/81/EC  of 15 December 1997. In the preamble to this agreement, the contracting parties announced their intention to consider the need for similar agreements relating to other flexible forms of work. On 18 March 1999, they concluded a framework agreement on fixed-term work, which is implemented by this directive.  The Commission felt that it was necessary to establish a balanced and flexible framework, compatible with the continued increase in fixed-term contracts, while preventing their abuse.  On 6 May 1999, Parliament adopted a resolution on the Commission’s proposal in which it called on the Council to approve the framework agreement on fixed-term work [not published in the Official Journal]. Nonetheless, Parliament regretted to note that the agreement covers only successive employment relationships, that the rules designed to prevent abuse through successive fixed-term contracts contain no qualitative or quantitative obligations, and that no provision is made for priority access to jobs created or for these workers to have access to appropriate vocational training.
summary of   Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 on nutrition and health claims made on foods   what is the aim of the regulation   It seeks to regulate the claims  *  on foods labelled and advertised in the European Union (EU).   It aims to ensure that nutrition claims  *  and health claims  *  on food labels and in presentations and advertising are clear and based on evidence that is generally accepted by the scientific community.   There is a wide range of substances, such as vitamins, minerals, amino acids, essential fatty acids, fibre and herbal extracts, with a nutritional or physiological effect that might be present in a food and be the subject of a claim.   The regulation seeks to:   ensure a high level of consumer protection;   give the consumer the necessary information to make choices in full knowledge of the facts; and   create equal conditions of competition for the food industry.     key points   The  European Commission  must draw up nutrient  *  profiles and conditions for the use of nutrition and health claims on foods, taking into account:   the  quantities of nutrients and other substances   *  contained in the food, such as:   fatty acids,   saturated fatty acids,   trans-fatty acids,   sugars, and   salt;     the  role and importance of the food  in the diet in general or risk groups such as children;   the  presence of nutrients  scientifically recognised as having an effect on health.   Health claims should not:   be false, ambiguous or misleading;   give rise to doubt about the safety or nutritional adequacy of other foods;   encourage excess consumption;   suggest that a balanced and varied diet cannot provide appropriate quantities of nutrients;   make suggestions that health could be affected by not consuming the food;   refer to a rate or amount of weight loss;   refer to recommendations of individual health professionals.   The use of nutrition and health claims will only be allowed if the  presence, absence or reduced content  in a food of a substance has been shown to have a  beneficial effect  , as established by  accepted scientific data  . Such substances must be in quantities that can be reasonably consumed and in an amount to give the desired effect.  Health claims will only be allowed if the following information is on the label:   the target population for the claim;   a statement of the importance of a varied and balanced diet and a healthy lifestyle;   the quantity and pattern of consumption needed to obtain the claimed beneficial effect;   a statement aimed at persons who should avoid consuming the food (e.g. pregnant women);   a warning for products likely to present a health risk if consumed to excess;   where reduced risk of disease is claimed, a statement that the disease has multiple risk factors and altering one of these may or may not have a beneficial effect;   any other restrictions or directions for use.   Health claims based on generally accepted scientific data, well understood by the average consumer, may be exempted from the authorisation process.  Drinks containing more than 1.2 % by volume of alcohol must not bear any health or nutrition claims other than one referring to the reduction in the alcohol or energy content.  Regulation (EU) No  432/2012  provides for the list of permitted health claims, other than those related to the reduction of disease risk and to children’s development and health. This regulation has applied since 14 December 2012 and is regularly amended to update the list of newly authorised health claims.   Application for authorisation   Any manufacturer may request the inclusion of a new claim to the permitted list by submitting an application to any EU country. The latter forwards it to the  European Food Safety Authority  (EFSA) and the Commission then takes a decision on the use of the claim based on the EFSA’s scientific opinion.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 1 July 2007.   background   For more information, see:    ‘Nutrition and health claims’  on the European Commission's website    ‘EU register of nutrition and health claims made on foods’  on the European Commission's website    Commission guidance  on the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 (2007)    Guidelines  for the implementation of specific conditions for health claims laid down in Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006   * key terms     Claim:  any message or representation, which is not mandatory under EU or national legislation, including pictorial, graphic or symbolic representation in any form that states, suggests or implies that a food has particular characteristics.     Nutrition claim:  any claim that states, suggests or implies that a food has particular beneficial nutritional properties due to:    the energy (calorific value) that it:   provides,   provides at a reduced or increased rate, or   does not provide; and/or     the nutrients or other substances that it:   contains,   contains in reduced or increased proportions, or   does not contain.        Health claim:  any claim that states, suggests or implies that a relationship exists between a food category, a food or one of its constituents and health.     Nutrient:  protein, carbohydrate, fat, fibre, sodium, vitamins and minerals listed in the annex to Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011, and substances that belong to or are components of one of those categories.     Other substance:  a substance other than a nutrient that has a nutritional or physiological effect.
   Local authorities and development assistance     Local authorities and development assistance     The Commission emphasises the importance of the recent emergence of local authorities as key actors in development assistance and proposes the first elements of a European strategy intended to strengthen their participation in the design and implementation of European development policy.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee and Committee of the Regions - Local authorities: actors for development [       COM(2008) 626 final      – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The purpose of this Communication is, on the one hand, to recognise the importance of the local authorities’ contribution to the development policy of the European Union (EU), and, on the other hand, to present the first elements of a strategy that will make it possible to capitalise on the experience of the local actors in this area by reinforcing their participation in the design and implementation of development activities, in a coordinated and strategic manner.     The Commission considers that local authorities bring unique added value to development processes, by virtue of, in particular:      their ability to mobilise different stakeholders to work together, to increase public awareness,       their knowledge of local needs and expertise in sectors conducive to poverty reduction (urbanisation, water and sanitation, etc.),       their direct experience in territorial development.      According to the Commission, it is necessary to exploit this potential while avoiding excessive fragmentation of development assistance.     The European Union should therefore introduce a framework enabling local authorities to operate as actors for development, in accordance with the general principles adopted at international level. The Commission also considers that local authorities as sub-national actors should be better represented on the European scene and suggests that they organise themselves in order to make their voices heard in the international donor groups. It proposes the establishment of a structured dialogue on development policy with local authorities, a dialogue which could take place under the aegis of the Committee of the Regions and take the form of annual assemblies. In addition, the EU could develop specific tools which would allow local authorities to better coordinate their actions with those of European development policy.     The Commission also underlines the importance of local authorities in the developing countries. It believes that they can play an essential role in reinforcing governance and local democracy, public services and territorial (regional) planning. Moreover, a large number of EU partner countries have launched a process of decentralisation but face many challenges that stronger relations with local authorities in EU Member States could help to overcome.     The Commission suggests that the future European approach could be based on the following:       aid effectiveness        : enhancing development cooperation in support of local governance, with the aim of increasing the coherence, complementarity and effectiveness of different local actors, in accordance with the principles of the         Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness        ;        identifying actors and activities        : creating mechanisms to improve overall knowledge of development activities implemented by local authorities. This may include an Atlas of Decentralised Cooperation, a compendium of best practice, or an observatory;        creating a “stock exchange”        : matching supply and demand in development cooperation by means of a platform for the exchange of information, in order to reconcile expertise and financial resources, to reinforce the network of local authorities involved in territorial cooperation and to create partnerships. This “stock exchange” under the aegis of the Committee of the Regions would act as a point of contact between local authorities in the EU and partner countries and as a tool for creating new partnerships;        supporting decentralised cooperation actions        : the Commission wishes to continue to support the actions carried out by local authorities for development in order to enhance the exchange of experience and build closer and more long-term partnerships. The Commission also considers that the EU and local authorities in the EU should support the role of national associations of local authorities in partner countries, in order that they can participate in their national political dialogue.       Context      The importance of the role of local authorities in European development policy has already been emphasised several times, notably in 2003, in the Commission Communication “       Governance and development      ”, in 2005, in the context of the       EU Strategy for Africa      , and in 2006, in another Communication devoted to       Non-state Actors and Local Authorities in Development      .

summary of    Regulation (EEC) No 4055/86 applying the principle of freedom to provide services to maritime transport between EU countries and with non-EU countries     Regulation (EEC) No 4057/86 on unfair pricing practices in maritime transport     Regulation (EEC) No 4058/86 on coordinated action to safeguard free access to cargoes in ocean trades     Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 on the implementation of the rules on competition laid down in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty     Regulation (EC) No 246/2009 on the application of Article 81(3) of the Treaty to certain categories of agreements, decisions and concerted practices between liner shipping companies (consortia)     Regulation (EC) No 906/2009 on the application of Article 81(3) of the Treaty to certain categories of agreements, decisions and concerted practices between liner shipping companies (consortia)    what is the aim of the regulations  They aim to organise maritime transport in accordance with the basic principles of EU law to  provide services  ,  competition  , and  free access to the market  in sea transport.   key points    Freedom to provide services    Regulation No 4055/86:    grants EU-country nationals (and non-EU shipping companies using ships registered in an EU country and controlled by EU nationals) the  right to carry passengers or goods by sea  between any port of an EU country and any port or offshore installation of another EU country or of a non-EU country;   requires any  national restrictions  which reserve the carriage of goods to vessels flying the national flag  to be phased out or adjusted  , and prevents the introduction of new restrictions;   sets out a  procedure  for cases where EU-country shipping companies have no effective opportunity to carry goods to and from a particular non-EU country;    extends the benefits  of the regulation to  non-EU nationals established in the EU  .   Regulation No  3577/92/EEC  deals specifically with freedom to provide services in sea transport within EU countries (‘maritime cabotage’  *  ).   Unfair pricing in maritime transport    Regulation No 4057/86:    authorises the EU to apply  redressive duties  in order to protect shipowners in EU countries from unfair pricing practices on the part of non-EU shipowners. These redressive duties can be imposed after an investigation which demonstrates that injury has been caused by unfair pricing and that the interests of the EU make intervention necessary;   concerning the  examination of injury  , lays down the appropriate factors or indicators to be taken into consideration, e.g. a reduction in the shipowner’s market share or profits, or the effect on employment;   lays down a  procedure  for complaints, consultations and subsequent investigations.    Free access to ocean trades    Regulation No 4058/86:    applies when action by a non-EU country or by its agents  restricts free access  to the transport of liner cargoes, bulk cargoes or other cargoes by shipping companies of EU countries or by ships registered in an EU country (except where such action is taken in conformity with the  United Nations liner code  );   allows for  coordinated action by the EU  following a request made by an EU country to the  European Commission  . Such action might include diplomatic representation to non-EU countries and countermeasures directed at the shipping companies concerned;   permits similar coordinated action to be taken at the request of another country belonging to the  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  with which a  reciprocal arrangement  has been concluded.    Competition rules   General EU competition laws laid down in  Regulation (EC) No 1/2003  also apply to the EU maritime transport sector. However, in accordance with  Council Regulation (EC) No 246/2009  , the Commission may make exceptions for certain types of cooperation between liner shipping  *  companies (consortia  *  ). The Commission accordingly adopted  Regulation (EC) No 906/2009  , which allows these exceptions, and extended it until 25 April 2020 by Regulation (EU) No  697/2014  .   from when do the regulations apply   Council Regulation (EEC) No 4055/86 has applied since 1 January 1987.   Council Regulations (EEC) No 4057/86 and 4058/86 have applied since 1 July 1987.   Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 has applied since 1 May 2004.

   International investments: towards a comprehensive European policy     International investments: towards a comprehensive European policy     The European Union (EU) establishes the foundations of a new European policy as regards international investments. This policy should be based on the new powers attributed to the EU to remove the obstacles to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) transactions. Whilst the EU is the leading issuer of and global destination for FDI, emerging markets are becoming more and more active in this area.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - Towards a comprehensive European international investment policy [       COM(2010) 343      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The Commission presents a strategy to prepare a new European policy for international investment.     Since the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty, the European Union (EU) has       exclusive competence      to introduce the progressive liberalisation of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) transactions       *      . A new European policy should thus enable the treatment of foreign investors in the EU to be improved, and access for European investors to third-country markets to be facilitated.      The foundations of a common policy       European investors in third countries      should be able to benefit from a favourable and stable environment, particularly in countries where the legal, political or economic conditions are insufficient to guarantee the certainty of investments. Thus, at the present time, EU countries conclude       Bilateral Investment Treaties      (BITs) with third countries, in order to obtain guarantees on the treatment of their investors. However, this situation creates unequal conditions of competition between European investors.     In the future, the EU should obtain guarantees through       trade negotiations      . Its trade partners should commit to protecting and facilitating the flow of all forms of European investment. The EU may also conclude stand-alone investment agreements with certain countries (in particular with China or Russia), in order to increase the degree of cooperation in one specific trade sector or for all types of investments.      Foreign investors in the EU      should in turn benefit from a level playing field and uniform and optimum conditions.     Finally, a common policy should enable       investors’ needs to be better addressed      at every stage (planning, admission to a country, etc.). EU countries should also be able to adopt measures to       promote investment      , at national, regional and local levels, in particular through tax incentives or technical assistance.      A common negotiation agenda      Each trade partnership is unique, according to existing relations between partner States. Nevertheless, the Commission identifies a number of principles which should frame its future negotiations as regards international investments. These are:       selection criteria for partner countries        , which take into account the guarantees offered to European investors (fair and predictable treatment, political and institutional stability, economic potential, etc) and the degree of trade cooperation;       the treatment of         investment-related fields        , in order to cover all transactions concerning the acquisition or establishment of enterprises (costs of fund transfers, payments, intellectual property rights, etc);        investment protection standards        , specifically concerning the fair treatment of investors, legal certainty, the principle of proportionality of public action and also expropriation rights and the freedom to transfer funds;       the         implementation of commitments concerning FDI        , for example to guarantee transparency or the proper regulation of litigation;        States’ international responsibility        , in particular concerning the payment of financial compensation.      These principles are to be formalised by a Commission Recommendation.       Key terms         Foreign Direct Investment: any foreign investment which serves to establish lasting and direct links with an undertaking whose capital is employed to carry out an economic activity. Such investments may enable shareholders to participate in the management or control of a company.       RELATED ACTS      Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing transitional arrangements for bilateral investment agreements between Member States and third countries [         COM(2010) 344        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      The Commission proposes a transitional framework for implementing international investment agreements. This framework should allow existing agreements to be maintained and conditions to be laid down for future agreements.

summary of   Regulation (EU) No 655/2014 — European Account Preservation Order   what is the aim of the regulation  It aims to  facilitate debt recovery  between EU countries in  civil and commercial matters  .  It establishes a  new procedure  allowing a court in one EU country to  freeze funds in the bank account of a debtor  in another EU country.   key points   A European procedure is established whereby a creditor is able to obtain a  European Account Preservation Order  (EAPO) that blocks funds held by the debtor in a bank account or accounts in another EU country(ies).   Scope   The EAPO is available to  citizens and businesses  :   in  cases between EU countries  , i.e. when the account, at the date of application for an EAPO, is held in an EU country other than where the creditor is domiciled or the court seized is based;   as an  alternative to national procedures  , but does not replace them.   It applies to  financial claims  in civil and commercial matters,  excluding  the following matters:   revenue, customs or administrative matters and social security;   rights in property arising out of marriage or equivalent relationship, and wills and succession;   claims against a debtor who is the object of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, judicial arrangements, compositions or other similar proceedings.   Some categories of specially protected bank accounts are also excluded.  The EAPO is  not available  for creditors or bank accounts based in  Denmark  or the  United Kingdom (   1   )  .   Procedure for obtaining an EAPO    The procedure is open  before initiating proceedings  on the substance of the matter against the debtor,  during  the proceedings or  after  obtaining a judgment, court settlement or authentic instrument requiring the debtor to pay.   The  court competent  to issue an EAPO is normally one that is competent to rule on the substance of the matter. Where the debtor is a consumer, the court competent to issue an EAPO to secure a claim relating to the consumer’s contract is the court of the EU country where the debtor is domiciled.   In all cases, the creditor must provide  evidence  to convince the court that there is a real risk that justifies the need to freeze the debtor’s account. If the creditor requests an EAPO before obtaining a judgment on the substance of the matter, sufficient evidence should also be given to the likely success of the substance of the claim.   A specific  form  is to be used in order to apply for an EAPO, together with all supporting documents.   Short  time limits  are set by which the different steps in the procedure must be completed; these vary depending on whether the creditor has already obtained a judgment or not.   The creditor has the right to  appeal  against a refusal to issue an EAPO.   In order to ensure the  surprise effect  and the usefulness of the EAPO, the debtor is not informed prior to its implementation.   The creditor who does not know the debtor’s account information can, under certain conditions, request the court to obtain account information from designated authorities in the EU country of enforcement.    Recognition, enforceability and enforcement of the EAPO    An EAPO issued in an EU country in accordance with the regulation should be recognised and enforceable in another EU country  without any special procedure or declaration of enforceability  .   There is an  obligation on the bank  to declare, by means of a specific form, whether the EAPO has led to the preservation of any of the debtor’s funds.   The creditor has a duty to request the  release of any funds  preserved that exceed the amount specified in the EAPO.   Some amounts may be  exempt from seizure  under the law of the country of enforcement, i.e. amounts necessary to ensure the livelihood of the debtor and of their family.    Safeguards for the debtor   In order to counterbalance the absence of a prior hearing, there are the following safeguards for the debtor against the abusive use of the EAPO:    remedies  — including a right of appeal — to be able to challenge the EAPO as soon as the debtor is informed of the blocking of their accounts; and   rules on the  provision of a security  by the creditor — to ensure that the debtor can be compensated for any damage caused by the EAPO:   rules on the  creditor’s liability  for any damage caused to the debtor by the EAPO due to an error on the creditor’s behalf.    Forms   There are nine dedicated EAPO forms in total. Their content is set out in Implementing Regulation (EU)  2016/1823  .   General rules    The regulation also addresses various related matters, including legal representation, court fees, costs supported by the banks, fees charged by authorities, data protection and language of documents.   The regulation does not affect the application of a number of related acts, such as Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 (  on the service of documents  ) and Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 (  on the taking of evidence  ).   from when does the regulation apply  The regulation has applied since 18 January 2017 with the exception of its Article 50, which has applied since 18 July 2016. Article 50 relates to the information to be supplied by EU countries, such as the courts that they designate to issue (Article 6(4)) and the authorities to enforce EAPOs.   background   The regulation follows a  Green Paper  on  improving the efficiency of enforcing judgments in the EU  . In it, the  European Commission  described how the fragmentation of national rules on enforcement negatively affected debt collection within the EU, and observed that in practice a creditor seeking to recover a monetary claim in Europe will most commonly try to do so by taking enforcement actions against the debtor’s bank account, and that such procedures exist in most EU countries.

   European agenda for culture in a globalising world     European agenda for culture in a globalising world     The Commission proposes a new European agenda for culture, which attempts to respond to the challenges of globalisation. This new strategy aims to intensify cultural cooperation in the European Union (EU), focusing on a series of concrete proposals to achieve a set of common objectives.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 10 May 2007 on a European agenda for culture in a globalizing world [       COM(2007) 242      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The cultural sector plays a key role in terms of its numerous social, economic and political implications. Consequently, culture has a fundamental part in the process of European integration.     On the basis of these considerations, and in light of the results of an online consultation of stakeholders in the cultural sector, the Commission proposes a new European agenda for culture that focuses on a limited number of objectives. To work towards these objectives, the Commission also suggests new mechanisms for cooperation with and among European Union (EU) countries, other levels of governance and civil society.     The objectives of the new European agenda for culture are built around       three priorities      :      Cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue      Openness and exchanges between different cultures should be promoted. Accordingly, the new agenda for culture seeks to encourage:      mobility of artists and workers in the cultural sector and the circulation of all forms of artistic expression;       strengthening intercultural competences and intercultural dialogue, by developing capacities included among the         key competences for lifelong learning        , such as cultural awareness and expression, and communication in foreign languages.       Stimulating creativity within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs      Cultural industries contribute to the dynamism of the European economy and to EU competitiveness. By way of example, the cultural sector employs nearly five million people in the EU. In this respect, the Commission proposes the following objectives:      promoting creativity in education and incorporating this dimension into the lifelong learning measures;       strengthening the organisational capacities of the cultural sector, by focusing on entrepreneurship and the training of the cultural sector in managerial competences (innovative sources of financing, European dimension of commercial activities, etc.);       developing effective partnerships between the cultural sector and other sectors (ICTs, research, tourism, social partners, etc.) to reinforce the impact of investments in culture.       Culture as a vital element in international relations      In line with the Unesco Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions, ratified by the EU and most of its countries, the new agenda for culture proposes to reinforce the cultural dimension as a vital element of EU external relations. This priority is accompanied by a number of measures to:      pursue political dialogue in the field of culture and promote cultural exchanges between the EU and non-EU countries;       promote access to global markets for cultural goods and services from developing countries through agreements that grant preferential treatment or trade-related assistance measures;       build on external relations to set up financial and technical support (preservation of cultural heritage, promotion of cultural activities across the world);       ensure that all projects funded by the EU take account of local culture;       step up EU involvement in the work of international organisations active in the field of culture and in the United Nations ‘Alliance of Civilisations’ process.       Working methods      The Commission seeks to establish a structured dialogue with the cultural sector to achieve these objectives. This dialogue would include all stakeholders, from artists and creators to cultural industries. To this end, the Commission recommends:      identifying all actors in the cultural sector;       organising a "Cultural Forum" that brings together all these stakeholders;       representing at European level the views of stakeholders in this sector;       developing social dialogue for social partners in the cultural sector;       bringing a cultural dimension to European public debates by using, in particular, the permanent representations of the Commission.      This new strategy for culture and all the measures proposed depend on closer cooperation between the EU and its countries through the open method of coordination (OMC) mechanism. It also aims to develop a structured dialogue with the cultural sector.     The new European agenda for culture is complemented by other actions related to the cultural sector, such as the       2008 European Year of Intercultural Dialogue      .      Background      The cultural sector has already been the subject of several European level actions to promote culture, such as the “       Culture      ”, “       Europe for Citizens      ”, and       MEDIA      programmes.     RELATED ACTS      Commission Report to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 19 July 2010 on the implementation of the European Agenda for Culture [         COM(2010) 390        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      This report presents the progress made on the objectives of the European agenda for culture both at the European and national level, as well as the first experiences with the new working methods.     The promotion of cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue has involved a variety of issues and actions, such as:      the 2008 European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, which initiated new national policies and structures and a political agreement at EU level;       the 2008 Commission communication on multilingualism, which aims at transferring linguistic diversity into an asset;       access to culture via digitisation, to which end Europeana was launched in 2008, and through a proposed European Heritage Label.      To promote culture as a catalyst for creativity, several initiatives have been taken, such as:      the 2009 European Year of Creativity and Innovation, which examined how culture may generate economic and social innovation;       studies on the impact of culture on creativity, on entrepreneurship in cultural and creative industries and on the contribution of culture to local and regional development;       the 2010 Green Paper on the unlocking of the potential of cultural and creative industries.      The promotion of culture in EU external relations has received increased impetus since the adoption of the agenda and has included:      a new Euromed strategy on culture, which is currently under preparation;       important efforts to rehabilitate cultural heritage in EU candidate countries, including through the Instrument of Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) civil society facility;       a Eastern Partnership Culture Programme, which is to be launched in 2010;       a process to strengthen the role of culture in development policies, which was launched in 2009;       the MEDIA Mundus programme (2011-13), which will succeed the preparatory action MEDIA International.      The first experiences of the OMC indicate that, in general, it is an effective tool for cooperating in the cultural field. However, it has not been used for long enough to draw any substantial conclusions. For the future, cooperation will have to be reinforced, with adapted working methods. The structured dialogue in the cultural sector is taking place through thematic platforms of European associations and the European Culture Forum. The thematic platforms have been especially beneficial for intensifying dialogue within the sector. Nevertheless, further efforts need to be made to achieve more focused dialogue with civil society in future.

   Limitations on the admission of third-country nationals for employment     Limitations on the admission of third-country nationals for employment     1) OBJECTIVE     To establish principles governing Member States' policies of admission of third-country nationals to their territories for employment.     2) ACT      Council Resolution of 20 June 1994      on limitations on admission of third-country nationals to the territory of the Member States for employment [Official Journal C 274 of 19.09.1996].     3) SUMMARY     Current limitations are to be maintained or, where necessary, tightened up in accordance with the report on immigration and asylum policy adopted by the European Council in Maastricht in December 1991, which gave priority to the harmonisation of policies on admission.     While acknowledging the contribution of migrant workers to the economic development of their respective host countries, the Council notes that at present no Member State is pursuing an active immigration policy, which is why temporary admission for employment may be considered only in exceptional circumstances. Present high levels of unemployment increase the need to ensure that job vacancies are filled as far as possible by Community nationals or nationals of EFTA countries which are parties to the EEA agreement.     The Council consequently resolves that the principles set out below should not be relaxed by Member States in their national legislation or in any subsequent revisions of their national legislation. They should bring their national legislation into line with these principles by 1 January 1996, although the principles are not legally binding on them and do not afford grounds for proceedings by individual workers or employers.     Member States' policies are to observe the principles set out below governing:      admission criteria;       admission procedures;       period of admission;       extension of stay;       business visitors;       third countries with close links with a Member State.      Admission criteria     Member States will consider requests for admission to their territories for the purpose of employment only where vacancies in a Member State cannot be filled by national and Community manpower or by non-Community manpower lawfully resident on a permanent basis in that Member State. In this context they will apply the procedure laid down in Part II of Regulation No       1612/68      on the free movement of workers within the Community.     Third-country nationals may be admitted on a temporary basis, where:      a job is offered to a named worker or named employee of a service provider and is of a special nature in view of the requirement of specialist qualifications (professional qualifications, experience, etc.);       an employer offers vacancies to named workers and the competent authorities consider that the grounds adduced by the employer are justified in view of a temporary manpower shortage on the national or Community labour market which would significantly affect the operation of the business or the employer himself.      Admission procedure     Vacancies are offered to:      seasonal workers in strictly controlled numbers for a specifically defined job;       trainees;       frontier workers;       intra-corporate transferees, i.e. persons temporarily transferred by their company as key personnel.      Third-country nationals will not be admitted unless they have been given prior authorisation to take up employment. The authorisation may be in the form of a work permit issued to either the employer or the employee.     Third-country nationals must also be in possession of any necessary visa or residence permit.     Initial authorisation for employment will normally be restricted to employment in a specific job with a specified employer.     Period of admission     A seasonal worker will be admitted for a maximum of six months in any twelve-month period, and must remain outside the territories of the Member States for a period of at least six months before being readmitted for employment.     Trainees will be admitted for a maximum period of one year in the first instance. This period may be fixed at more than a year and extended exclusively for the time needed to obtain a professional qualification recognised by the Member State concerned in the sphere of their activity. Other third-country nationals admitted to the territories of the Member States for employment will be admitted for a period not exceeding four years in the first instance.     Extension of stay     A person already present in the territory of a Member State as a visitor or student will not in principle be permitted to extend his stay for the purpose of taking or seeking employment. Such persons must return to their own countries on conclusion of their visit or studies. In principle a person admitted as a trainee or service provider or employee of a service provider will not be permitted to extend his stay in authorised employment except in order to complete the training or activity under contract for which he was admitted.     A seasonal worker will not be permitted to extend his stay for the purpose of taking employment of a different type. An extension of the period of his stay may be authorised to allow him to complete the work for which the original authorisation was granted. However, the total length of his stay may not exceed six months in any twelve-month period. Other workers may be permitted to extend their period of stay in authorised employment, but only if they continue to satisfy the criteria originally applied to the decision on whether to admit them for authorised employment.     The Member States will examine the desirability of issuing a permanent residence permit to third-country nationals who have had restrictions on their employment lifted.     Business visitors     It is possible to admit as workers third-country nationals not residing in the territory of a Member State who are seeking entry to:      negotiate for the supply of goods or services;       deliver goods or assemble machinery manufactured in a third country as part of a supply contract, provided that such persons will be dealing only with businesses in the territory of the Member State and not with the general public and that any one visit and possibly the work permit does not exceed six months.

summary of   Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 — type approval requirements for motor vehicles and their trailers, and systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, as regards their general safety and the protection of vehicle occupants and vulnerable road users   what is the aim of the regulation   It aims to significantly reduce deaths and serious injuries on EU roads by introducing state-of-art safety technologies as standard vehicle equipment, and to enhance the competitiveness of EU car manufacturers on the global market by providing the first ever EU legal framework for automated and fully automated vehicles.   It amends Regulation (EU)  2018/858  on EU approval and market surveillance measures for motor vehicles and their trailers (see  summary  ).   key points    This new general safety regulation updates EU vehicle safety requirements, including those on to address the specific concerns of  vulnerable road users  such as pedestrians and cyclists.    Advanced vehicle systems    All new vehicles  must be equipped with the following safety features:   intelligent speed assistance;   alcohol interlock installation facilitation;   driver drowsiness and attention warning systems;   advanced driver distraction warning systems;   emergency stop signals;   reversing detection systems;   event data recorders;   accurate tyre pressure monitoring.    Cars and vans  must be equipped with further advanced safety measures including:   advanced emergency braking systems capable of detecting motor vehicles in front, as well as vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians and cyclists;   emergency lane-keeping systems;   enlarged  head impact protection zones  capable of mitigating injuries in collisions with vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians and cyclists.    Buses and lorries  , in addition to meeting the general requirements and being equipped with existing systems (such as lane departure warning and advanced emergency braking systems), must also:   be equipped with advanced systems capable of detecting pedestrians and cyclists in close proximity to the nearside of the vehicle, warning of their presence or avoiding a collision with these vulnerable road users;   be constructed in such a way as to reduce  blind spots  in front of and to the side of the driver.   The regulation allows the  European Commission  to adopt specific implementing acts for the safety of  hydrogen-powered and automated vehicles  in the light of future technical developments.   Review    The Commission must present an evaluation report on the effectiveness of the safety measures and systems by 7 July 2027.   If appropriate, the report must make recommendations and include a proposal for legislation to further reduce or eliminate road transport accidents and injuries.   A further report should be presented every  5 years subsequently  .

   Single Market Act: improving our work, business and exchanges with one another     Single Market Act: improving our work, business and exchanges with one another     The end of 2012 will mark the 20th anniversary of the introduction of the single market. During the past two decades, the creation of the single market, with the opening of borders, has been one of the main driving forces behind growth in Europe. Recent globalisation and technological change have created new challenges for the European Union (EU). This Single Market Act therefore proposes to meet these challenges by putting businesses and Europeans at the heart of the single market in order to create a reliable tool to promote growth.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 27 October 2010 - Towards a Single Market Act For a highly competitive social market economy 50 proposals for improving our work, business and exchanges with one another [       COM(2010) 608      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This Communication sets out various measures proposed by the European Commission in order to relaunch the single market and make it a driving force for growth again, so as to promote a social market economy. These measures concern businesses, citizens and the governance of the single market. The Single Market Act is an initiative presented jointly with the       EU Citizenship Report 2010      .      Measures proposed for businesses      In the European Union (EU), 20 million businesses employ 175 million citizens and supply goods and services to 500 million consumers both in the EU and abroad.     The Commission hopes to       encourage and protect the creative potential of businesses      by combating       piracy      . The Commission therefore intends to propose an action plan against counterfeiting and piracy in 2010, as well as a framework directive on the management of copyrights in 2011.     The Single Market Act aims to       promote new approaches towards sustainable growth      . One of these approaches concerns the       development of the market in services      on the basis of the ‘mutual evaluation’ process set out in the       Services Directive      . It also provides for initiatives to       develop electronic commerce      . To enhance the ‘       sustainable      ’ nature of growth, the Commission will revise the       Energy Tax Directive      in 2011. As a further step, the Commission will present an energy efficiency plan in 2011.     European       small and medium-sized enterprises      (SMEs) represent a significant source of innovation and jobs. To develop this potential, the Commission hopes to adopt an action plan in 2011 for improving SME access to capital markets. It also aims to link the        Small Business Act       with the       2020 strategy      . In addition, it proposes a review of the       accounting Directives      to simplify SMEs’ financial reporting obligations.     To       fund innovation and long-term investment      , the Commission hopes to create project bonds to finance European projects. In addition, it proposes to eliminate any tax treatment that hampers cross-border activities and to make the awarding of contracts more flexible.     The Single Market Act lays the foundations of a       business-friendly legal and fiscal environment      . From this perspective, the Commission hopes to propose a Directive on a       common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB)      in 2011. A new VAT strategy is to be presented in the same year.     The EU must strengthen its       competitiveness on international markets      by further developing regulatory cooperation with its main trading partners. The idea is to develop an instrument which draws on the implementation of the EU’s international commitments.      Measures proposed for citizens       Public services and key infrastructure      must be improved. To this end, the Commission intends to present a Communication including a series of measures on       services of general interest      . Concerning transport, the Commission hopes to adopt a revision of the guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network. The Commission also intends to adopt energy infrastructure priorities up to 2020/2030.     In addition, it is of paramount importance to       increase solidarity in the single market      . The Commission must therefore conduct a systematic analysis of the social impact of proposed legislation. It also intends to re-examine the       Directive on the activities and surveillance of pension funds      in 2011, and to launch a consultation with the social partners in order to create a European framework for industrial restructuring.     One objective of the Single Market Act is to guarantee       access to employment and lifelong learning      . The system for the recognition of professional qualifications should therefore be reformed, based on an evaluation of the acquis in 2011. In addition, mobility for young people is to be encouraged by developing a ‘       Youth on the Move      ’ card.      New resources for the social market economy      must be developed. The first step in this respect must be to improve the quality of the current legal structures (foundations, cooperatives, mutual associations, etc.) linked to the social economy. The Commission also intends to launch a public consultation on corporate governance, and to propose a Social Business Initiative in 2011.      Consumers      are also at the heart of the single act for the internal market. The Commission therefore intends to evaluate existing practices concerning       price comparison websites      and to draw up guidelines for these websites based on Member States’ best practices. It also intends to draw up a multiannual action plan for the development of European market surveillance. Its priorities also include identifying and eliminating tax obstacles.      Measures proposed for good governance of the single market      The Commission is responsible for       enforcing the rules of the single market      . Member States are therefore called upon to increase the rate of transposition of the single market directives and to notify the transposition measures.     Good governance of the single market must be based on a       genuine electronic network for European administrations      . The Commission therefore intends to present a strategy on extending the       Internal Market Information System      in 2011.      Dispute resolution      must be improved. European consumers lose 0.3 % of Europe’s GNP each year due to sales of defective goods or sub-standard services. To overcome these problems, the Commission intends to adopt an initiative on the use of alternative dispute resolution in the EU, and a recommendation on the network of alternative dispute resolution systems for financial services.     To       provide citizens and businesses with specific information on the internal market      , the Commission hopes to develop the ‘       Your Europe      ’ internet portal and to coordinate it with ‘       Europe Direct      ’. The       SOLVIT network      must also be reinforced.     Finally, the Commission intends to consolidate       dialogue with civil society      (consumers, NGOs, trade unions, businesses, savers and local authorities).      Consultation      The Commission invites interested parties to submit their views on the relaunch of the single market by 28 February 2011.

   The employment policy guidelines (2003-2005)     The employment policy guidelines (2003-2005)     The employment guidelines 2003 lay down the priorities for structural reforms to be implemented in order to achieve the main economic objectives of the European Union (EU). For the first time, the EU relied on streamlined key policy coordination instruments -- the broad economic policy guidelines (BEPGs), the employment guidelines, and the internal market strategy -- which it gives a new three-year perspective.     ACT     Council Decision of 22 July 2003 on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States.     SUMMARY     The decision invites the Member States to conduct their employment policies with a view to implementing the objectives and progressing towards the targets specified in the broad economic policy guidelines (BEPGs) and       the internal market strategy      . All these policies, applied in the medium term (three years), are part of the ten-year comprehensive strategy established at the Lisbon European Council in 2000 and revised in 2005. In the framework of the revision for 2005, the Commission presented a new proposal for a decision on the employment guidelines which will take effect as from 2006. In this decision the Council of Ministers invites the Member States to apply a macroeconomic policy with the focus on stability and growth, comprising a strict budgetary policy and a moderate growth in wages negotiated with the social partners.     The employment guidelines 2003-2005 reinforce the policy of growth by structural reform with a view to creating more and better jobs. The Council of Ministers accompanies these guidelines with recommendations addressed to all Member States concerning the most serious and urgent reforms. The employment guidelines require a gender-mainstreaming approach in implementing all actions. The decision is based on the conclusions of the Commission's communication on the       future of the European Employment Strategy      (EES) which aims to integrate the main points of the Lisbon strategy in the EES and to simplify and clarify its policy priorities.      Main objectives      The European Union (EU) lays down the main objectives in the field of employment, viz.:       full employment        . The Council wishes to achieve an overall employment rate of 67 % in 2005 and 70 % in 2010, an employment rate for women of 57 % in 2005 and 60 % in 2010, and an employment rate of 50 % for older workers (55 to 64) in 2010;        improving quality and productivity at work        . This objective encompasses a wide range of areas, in particular intrinsic quality at work, skills, lifelong learning and career development, gender equality, health and safety at work, flexibility and security, inclusion and access to the labour market, work organisation and work-life balance, social dialogue and worker involvement, diversity and non-discrimination, and overall work performance;        strengthening social cohesion and inclusion        . In the framework of the open method of coordination, national employment policies should promote access to employment for all women and men; combat discrimination on the labour market and prevent the exclusion of people from the world of work.       The main priorities of the structural reforms ('the 10 commandments')      In order to achieve the overarching objectives, the Council invites the Member States to implement structural reforms comprising:       active and preventative measures for the unemployed and inactive        such as ensuring that, at an early stage of their unemployment spell, all jobseekers benefit from an early identification of their needs and from services such as advice and guidance, job search assistance, a job, or other employability measure (before reaching six months of unemployment in the case of young people and 12 months of unemployment in the case of adults), modernising labour market institutions, and ensuring regular evaluation of the programmes. The Member States must include, by 2010, 25 % of the long-term unemployed in an active measure in the form of training, retraining, work practice, or other employability measure, with the aim of achieving the average of the three most advanced Member States;        job creation and entrepreneurship        with particular attention to exploiting the job creation potential of new enterprises, of the service sector and of R & D. It is also a matter of simplifying and reducing administrative and regulatory burdens for business start-ups and SMEs and for the hiring of staff, facilitating access to capital and promoting education and training in entrepreneurial and management skills;        promotion of adaptability and mobility, social dialogue and corporate social responsibility        with a view to diversifying contractual and working arrangements, and to creating a better balance between work and private life and between flexibility and security. It is also a matter of encouraging access to training, improving conditions in terms of health and safety, productivity and the quality of work. The Member States will assure the anticipation and the positive management of economic change and restructuring and access to the labour market and training. They will address labour shortages and bottlenecks by promoting occupational and geographical mobility, by implementing the         skills and mobility action plan        , by improving the         recognition of qualifications        and by         greater transparency of qualifications and competencies        , the transferability of social security and pension rights, the taking into account of immigration, the transparency of employment opportunities, notably thanks to the         European employment network        , comprising all the vacancies advertised by the Member States' employment services;        promotion of the development of human capital, education and lifelong learning        to ensure that at least 85 % of 22-year olds in the European Union should have completed upper secondary education and that the European Union average level of participation in lifelong learning should be at least 12,5 % of the adult working-age population (25 to 64 age group). National policies will aim in particular to achieve an increase in investment in human resources and a significant increase in investment by enterprises in the training of adults;        promotion of active ageing        thanks to improvement of working conditions, notably health and safety at work, access to vocational training, flexibility of work organisation, eliminating incentives for early exit from the labour market and early retirement. Member States will aim to achieve an increase by five years of the effective average exit age from the labour market (estimated at 59,9 in 2001). The increase in the labour force should also be associated with a comprehensive approach covering in particular the availability and attractiveness of jobs for all population age groups. Where necessary, the potential offered by immigration should be taken into account.        promotion of gender equality by reducing gender gaps        in employment rates, unemployment rates and pay. The gender pay gap must be reduced by addressing sectoral and occupational segregation, job classifications and the different pay systems, and by improving transparency and access to education and training. It is also a matter of reconciling work and private life by increasing the number of childcare facilities so as to provide childcare by 2010 to at least 90% of children between three years and the mandatory school-leaving age and at least 33% of children under three years of age;        integration of and combating discrimination        against people at a disadvantage on the labour market, notably early school leavers, low-skilled workers, people with disabilities, immigrants and ethnic minorities. The objective of the Member States will be to reduce by 2010 the proportion of early school leavers to 10% (maximum average for the EU) and to reduce the unemployment gaps for people at a disadvantage and for third country nationals, according to any national targets;        tax and financial incentives to enhance work attractiveness        by reducing the number of working poor and, where appropriate, by eliminating unemployment, poverty and inactivity traps, and by encouraging participation in the labour market of disadvantaged groups by re-examining or reforming the tax and benefit systems. Member States will ensure effective management of social protection benefits, including the link with effective job search, support for employability, and, where appropriate, the elimination of inactivity traps. By 2010 they will reduce high marginal effective tax rates and, where appropriate, the tax burden on low paid workers;        transformation of undeclared work into regular employment        by striking a balance between simplification of the business environment (appropriate incentives in the tax and benefits system) and the application of sanctions to ensure that the law is respected;        addressing regional employment disparities        notably by developing the potential for job creation at the local level and partnerships between all relevant actors. The Member States will promote favourable conditions for private sector activity and investment and will focus public support on investment in human capital and the creation of suitable infrastructures (see also the BEPG guidelines 18 and 19), thanks mainly to the support of the         Cohesion Fund        , the Structural Funds and the European Investment Bank.      Implementation of the EES is a matter for the Member States. To ensure consistent management of this process, it is important to involve the national parliaments, the social partners and other national, regional and local bodies which are competent in the field of employment. The social partners will be involved in the effective implementation of the employment guidelines at national, interprofessional and sectoral level. Adequate allocation of financial resources will be ensured via transparency and cost-effectiveness as well as the sound use of financial support on the part of the Structural Funds, in particular the       European Social Fund      (ESF).

This Decision introduces the new comprehensive employment policy strategy adopted at the       Lisbon European Council      , while keeping the original four pillar structure intact (entrepreneurship, employability, adaptability and equal opportunities). The Lisbon Summit aims to raise the employment rate from 62.2% in 1999 to 70% in 2010 (and to over 60% for women). The social partners are more closely involved in implementing and monitoring the employment guidelines. With an eye to consistency, common themes have been reclassified, for example in the case of the "employability" pillar, which includes the guidelines on education and lifelong learning. A stronger focus has also been placed on tackling discriminatory aspects of the labour market in order to reinforce the link with social inclusion. The provisions on older workers have been widened from the tax-benefit aspect to a more comprehensive set of policies in support of active ageing.

   The link between the multilateral trading system and labour standards     The link between the multilateral trading system and labour standards     The European Union is exploring the prospect of discussions at the WTO on the link between the multilateral trading system and internationally recognised labour standards, while taking account of the fundamental principle of respecting the comparative advantage of developing countries.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, of 24 July 1996, on the link between the trading system and internationally recognised labour standards [       COM(1996) 402      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The citizens of Europe and the political authorities cannot remain indifferent to infringements of human rights in the context of labour relations, which can take the form of the deprivation of fundamental freedoms (slavery, forced labour, exploitation of children or the prohibition of association and collective bargaining).     The European Union must seek to guarantee respect for fundamental freedoms that can bring about working and living standards corresponding to the level of economic development and the social structures of the countries concerned.     The Commission favours the adoption of a gradual approach based on fundamental human rights that would not undermine the right of developing countries to use their comparative advantage of abundant, cheap labour. The Commission believes that these questions should be broached within the World Trade Organisation (WTO).     The study begun in 1994 by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on "trade, employment and internationally recognised labour standards" focuses on a series of universally recognised core labour standards: freedom of association and collective bargaining, elimination of exploitative forms of child labour, prohibition of forced labour, non-discrimination in employment. The study concludes that the economic effects of these standards are likely to be small and that they will not negatively affect the economic performance or the international competitive position of developing countries.     The International Labour Organisation (ILO) has set up a working group on the social dimension of liberalising international trade. Because of the difficulties encountered, the group agreed to suspend further discussion on whether to create a linkage between international trade and labour standards by introducing a social clause and a penalty mechanism.     At the       Copenhagen Social Summit      the heads of state and government throughout the world acknowledged that these core labour standards are best reflected by the ILO Conventions on the subject.     In the context of its new GSP (General System of Preferences) arrangements, the Union has introduced two types of autonomous measures:      possibility of withdrawing some or all of the preferences granted to countries which countenance slavery or forced labour;       "special incentive schemes" granting additional preferences to countries which so request and which comply with the ILO Conventions on freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining and on child labour.      At bilateral level, the cooperation agreements which the Union has concluded with non-Community countries cover economic and social cooperation: programmes of financial and technical assistance as regards education, the participation of women in economic development, etc.     Since 1992 it has also been necessary for every agreement concluded with non-Community countries to contain a clause on human rights. This clause refers to all rights, not only civil and political rights, but also to development, and to economic, social and cultural rights.     At multilateral level, the Commission emphasises the role of:      the ILO, which appears to be the most appropriate institution for examining issues relating to the promotion of labour standards;       the WTO, which is the natural forum for debating the links between trade and labour standards.      The ILO has mechanisms for monitoring the application of international labour conventions. However, none of its procedures involves the possibility of sanctions; the mechanisms in place have a moral impact (particularly on public opinion) but are not coercive. The promotion of labour standards will entail improving the ILO's efficiency and upgrading its monitoring systems.     Any discussions within the WTO should have as their point of departure three significant aspects:      the convergence of the objectives pursued by the multilateral trade system and the promotion of labour standards;       a multilateral approach to respond to the emergence of unilateral trade policies linked to the promotion of labour standards;       the impact of the application of universal labour standards on international competitiveness, particularly in the case of developing countries.      The Commission proposes that the Council seeks to establish a working party, at the WTO's Singapore Ministerial Conference from 9 to 13 December 1996, to investigate the link between the multilateral trading system and core labour standards.      RELATED ACTS       Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 18 September 2002 entitled "Trade and development -         Assisting developing countries to benefit from trade        " [         COM(2002) 513        final - Not published in the Official Journal]       OECD study on international trade and core labour standards (1996, updated in 2000)      The study discusses the interaction between trade liberalisation and the application of core labour standards. It shows that countries that fail to comply with core labour standards do not enjoy a competitive advantage in international trade, do not attract direct foreign investment, and do not perform more effectively on the export front. Conversely, the study shows that more stringent core labour standards can stimulate economic growth and efficiency.      Conclusions of the Council of October 1999 on trade and labour      The Council highlighted the importance of the Singapore declaration and set out the Union's position on trade and social development, with an eye to the WTO ministerial conference in Seattle in November 1999.     The EU has a duty to do more to help protect core labour standards and thus support the work of the ILO and cooperate with the WTO. The Union is firmly opposed to any approach which is based on sanctions and will oppose any initiative to use workers' rights for protectionist purposes.      Ministerial declaration of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in Singapore in 1996      The WTO supports the promotion of internationally recognised core labour standards and believes that economic growth and development fostered by increased trade and further trade liberalisation contribute to the promotion of these standards.     Relations between international trade and working conditions, particularly as regards the issue of sanctions, are a sensitive topic. The declaration therefore points out that the WTO rejects the use of labour standards for protectionist purposes. The comparative advantage of countries, particularly low-wage developing countries, must in no way be put into question.

The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM(2011) 666      final – SEC(2011) 1202 final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     In its       2011 Report      the Commission gives a positive assessment of Iceland’s alignment with the European Union (EU)       acquis      due to its participation in the       European Economic Area      (EEA). Preparations for accession must be pursued.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission’s words)      EU       industrial policy      seeks to promote       industrial strategies      which strengthen competitiveness by accelerating adaptation to structural changes and encouraging a framework conducive to the creation and development of enterprises across the EU and to national and foreign investment. It also seeks to improve the overall business environment in which       small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)      operate. It presupposes a process of       privatisation      and       restructuring      (see also Chapter 8 – Competition policy). The Community strategy in this area essentially involves defining fundamental principles and drawing up industrial policy declarations. The implementation of enterprise policy and industrial policy requires an adequate administrative capacity at national, regional and local level.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      In general the country has achieved a high level of alignment in the field of       enterprise and industrial policy      . Specific measures have been adopted concerning industrial policy and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in order to overcome the challenges emerging in the wake of the economic and financial crisis.

summary of   Directive (EU) 2019/882 on the accessibility requirements for products and services   what is the aim of the directive   It aims to harmonise accessibility  *  requirements for certain products  *  and services so the EU’s internal market operates smoothly by eliminating and preventing any free-movement barriers that may exist because of divergent national legislation.   It aims to bring benefits to businesses, people with disabilities  *  and the elderly. Applying accessibility requirements will clarify the existing accessibility obligation in EU law, particularly in  public procurement  and  structural funds  .   It is known as the  European accessibility act  .   key points   The legislation will apply from 28 June 2025 to the following.    Products  :   computers and operating systems;   payment terminals and certain self-service terminals such as ATMs, ticketing and check-in machines, interactive self-service information terminals;   smartphones and other equipment for accessing telecommunication services;   TV equipment involving digital television services;   e-readers.      Services  :   telephony services;   services to access audiovisual media services;   certain elements of air, bus, rail and water transport services such as websites, mobile services, electronic tickets, information;   consumer banking;   e-books;    e-commerce  ;   answer to emergency calls to the  single European number ‘112’  .     The legislation  does not apply  to:   pre-recorded time-based media, such as videos and slides or office file formats published before 28 June 2025;   online maps if essential information is provided in an accessible digital way;   websites and other forms of archive containing content not updated or edited after 28 June 2025;   microenterprises providing services.    Specific accessibility requirements  apply to all products and services covered by the legislation, provided these do not alter their basic nature or impose a disproportionate burden on operators.    Products  must:   be designed and produced to maximise their use by people with disabilities;   comply with detailed rules on information and instructions, user interface and functionality design, support services and packaging.      Services  must:   provide information about the service, its accessibility features and facilities;   make websites and mobile devices easily accessible;   support systems, such as help desks, call centres and training to provide information on accessibility;   apply practices, policies and procedures to address the needs of people with disabilities. Specific rules apply to different services (electronic communications, audiovisual, air, bus, rail, water and urban transport, consumer banking, e-books, e-commerce and the answering to emergency 112 phone number).     EU countries may decide to require the compliance of the built environment where services are provided with accessibility requirements.   Annex II provides non-binding examples of how the various accessibility requirements may be met.   The legislation requires the following.    Manufacturers  must:   design and manufacture products according to the directive, taking into account any subsequent changes in the harmonised standards;   draw up the necessary technical documentation, carry out the conformity procedure and keep the information for 5 years;   provide clear identification on their products and their own contact details;   accompany the product with easily understood instructions and safety information.      Importers  must:   ensure the product has passed the conformity assessment procedure, has the necessary technical documentation, including instructions in a language users can easily understand, and bears the  CE marking  ;   refuse to place on the market a product they believe does not meet the accessibility requirements and to inform the manufacturer and market surveillance authorities.      Service providers  must:   design and provide services according to the directive;   make available to the public written and oral information easily accessible to people with disabilities on the service they offer and how this meets the accessibility requirements;   ensure procedures are in place to continue conforming with the accessibility requirements and take into account any changes.      Manufacturers, importers and distributors  must act immediately if they discover the product no longer complies with the legislation.    EU countries  must:   ensure all products and services covered by the legislation comply with its accessibility requirements;   on request supply the public with information on how companies implement the requirements;   implement and update procedures to:   check the compliance of services with the directive,   follow up complaints or reports on non-compliance,   verify that the company has remedied the failing;     provide ways, including legal action, to ensure compliance and penalties for any breach of the law.   The   European Commission   :   may adopt  delegated  and  implementing acts  to amend technical aspects of the directive;   may request the  European standardisation organisations  to draft harmonised standards on accessibility requirements or adopt technical specifications under certain conditions;   establishes a working group of representatives of authorities for market surveillance and services’ compliance and of stakeholders including disability organisations to:   promote exchange of information and best practice,   foster cooperation between authorities and stakeholders,   provide advice;     submits, by 28 June 2030 and every 5 years thereafter, a report to the  European Parliament  , the  Council  , the  European Economic and Social Committee  and the  Committee of the Regions  on the application of the legislation.   from when does the directive apply  It has to become law in the EU countries by 28 June 2022. EU countries must apply the measures from 28 June 2025.  However, EU countries may:   delay compliance for the European emergency 112 number until 28 June 2027;   give service providers whose facilities were already lawfully in use by 28 June 2025 a further 5 years (until 28 June 2030);   allow self-service terminals to operate until the end of their economically useful life, but no longer than 20 years after entering service.   background    Over 80 million people in the EU live with some kind of disability. With an ageing society, the number is increasing.   The EU’s  Charter of Fundamental Rights  recognises and respects the right of persons with disabilities to benefit from measures designed to ensure their independence, social and occupational integration and participation in the life of the community.   The directive defines people with disabilities in line with the  United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities  which has been ratified by all EU countries.   key terms    Accessibility:  design of products, devices, services or environments to be used by people with disabilities on equal basis with others.   Products:  a substance, preparation or good produced through a manufacturing process (other than food, feed, living plants and animals or products of human, plant and animal origin for future reproduction).   Person with disabilities:  someone with long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairment which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full, effective participation in society on equal basis with others.
act   Council Directive  2004/81/EC  of 29 April 2004 on the residence permit issued to third-country nationals who are victims of trafficking in human beings or who have been the subject of an action to facilitate illegal immigration, who cooperate with the competent authorities.   summary    what does this directive do  The directive sets out the procedure for issuing and renewing the residence permit and the conditions for non-renewal or withdrawal, as well as the treatment of victims prior to and after being granted a permit.   key points   The directive applies to non-EU nationals  regardless of whether they have entered the EU illegally  . Permits can be granted to those who have reached the age of majority in the respective EU country and  may apply to children under the conditions  set out in national laws.  Persons concerned must be informed of the possibilities offered under this directive by the competent authorities of the relevant EU country. Non-EU nationals are granted a  reflection period  to recover and to escape the influence of the perpetrators of the offences. This allows them to make an informed decision on whether to cooperate with the investigating authorities. During this period, the non-EU nationals concerned should:   not be made subject to any expulsion order;   if required, be provided with help to ensure they have adequate living standards and with access to emergency medical and, if appropriate, psychological treatment;   have access to translation and interpreting services, where appropriate;   have access to free legal aid, if provided for in national law.   The competent authorities are responsible for assessing whether the:   presence of the victim can help the investigation;   victim has shown a clear intention to cooperate;   victim cut all contact with those suspected of the given offences.   When the above three conditions have been fulfilled, a temporary renewable residence permit,  valid for at least 6 months,  will be issued. The permit can be renewed if the relevant conditions continue to be satisfied. The permit grants the holder access to the labour market and to vocational training and education, under conditions determined in national legislation.  The residence permit may not be renewed if the conditions of this directive are no longer met or if the relevant proceedings have been terminated. The permit may be withdrawn for a number of reasons, including if the victim renews contact with those suspected of committing the offences or ceases to cooperate or when the proceedings are discontinued.  EU countries are free to adopt or maintain  more favourable provisions  for the persons covered by this directive.  While the collection of data on various aspects of this directive still needs to be improved, two reports from the Commission on the application of the directive in  2010  and in  2014  have found that the possibility to issue permits in exchange for cooperation with authorities might be under-utilised by EU countries.   background   This directive must be read in conjunction with  Directive 2011/36/EU  on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims. The latter provides a horizontal legal framework for both EU and non-EU citizens and has reinforced most provisions of Council Directive 2004/81/EC, including the protection and assistance framework for children.

   Common rules for exports     Common rules for exports     This regulation establishes common rules for exports from the European Union (EU) based on the principle of freedom of export and defines the procedures enabling the EU to implement, where necessary, the surveillance and protective measures required.     ACT     Council Regulation (EC) No       1061/2009      of 19 October 2009 establishing common rules for exports.     SUMMARY     This regulation lays down the principle of       freedom of export      , stating that exports from the European Union (EU) to non-EU countries are free from quantitative restrictions.      Information and consultation procedures      EU countries may adopt protective measures if they consider it necessary due to unusual developments on the market. Before implementing these protective measures, the EU country must inform the Commission accordingly, which will then advise the other EU countries. Consultations may be held at any time and take place within an       advisory committee      composed of representatives of each EU country and chaired by a representative of the Commission. These consultations relate, in particular, to the export conditions and trends for the product in question as well as the measures, if any, to be adopted.     The Commission may request EU countries to supply       statistical data      on market trends in a given product for the purpose of assessing the economic and commercial situation. It may also ask them to exercise       surveillance      over given products in accordance with their national legislation and with the procedure specified by the Commission.      Protective measures      The interests of the EU may require the adoption of appropriate measures to prevent or remedy a critical situation brought about by a shortage of essential products, or to allow international commitments entered into by the EU or all the EU countries to be fulfilled, in particular those relating to trade in primary products. These measures are generally quantitative restrictions on exports.     The Commission, acting at the request of an EU country or on its own initiative, may make the export of a product subject to the production of an       export authorisation      . The granting of an export authorisation is governed by such provisions and subject to such limits as the Commission shall lay down pending subsequent action by the Council. The Council and the EU countries shall be notified of the measures taken which shall take effect immediately. These protective measures may be limited to exports to certain countries or exports from certain regions of the EU. They do not affect products already on their way to the EU frontier.     In principle, protective measures are adopted by the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission. The Commission may also implement such measures where immediate action is required.     During their application, protective measures are the subject of consultation on the advisory committee with a view to examining their effects and ascertaining whether the conditions for their application are still satisfied. As a result, they may be amended or revoked if they are no longer necessary.     This regulation does not prevent EU countries from adopting or applying quantitative restrictions on exports on grounds of public morality, public policy, public security, the protection of health and life of humans, animals and plants, the protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historic or archaeological value, or the protection of industrial and commercial property.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 1552/2005 — statistics relating to vocational training in enterprises   what is the aim of this regulation  It lays down the rules and methods for collecting European statistics on  vocational training  in enterprises  *  .   key points    Data to be collected in enterprises   EU countries must collect data on the following:   enterprises’  training policy  and  training strategies to develop workforce skills  ;   management, organisation and forms of  continuing vocational training  in enterprises;   the  role of social partners  in ensuring all aspects of continuing vocational training in the workplace;    access  to continuing vocational training, its volume and content, especially in the context of economic activity and enterprise size;   specific measures of enterprises to  improve their workforce’s skills in information and communication technologie  s;   chances for employees in  small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)  to access continuing vocational training and to  acquire new skills,  and specific SME needs in the provision of training;   the  effects of public measures  on this form of training in enterprises;    equal opportunities  to access training in enterprises for all employees (and with respect to gender and specific age-groups in particular);   specific measures for people at a  disadvantage in the labour market,  for example, older people and people from minorities;   measures geared to different  types of employment contract  ;   expenditure on continuing vocational training:  funding levels and funding resources  , incentives for continuing vocational training; and    evaluation and monitoring procedures  of enterprises as regards continuing vocational training.   As regards,  initial vocational training in the workplace  , EU countries should collect data on:   participants in training of this type; and   total expenditure on training of this type.    Scope   The statistics cover training in enterprises involved in economic activities falling into sections B to N and R to S of the EU’s NACE classification  *  .   Statistical units   As a general rule, data are gathered only in relation to enterprises employing 10 or more people.   Data sources   EU countries may collect the data by means of surveys in enterprises or a combination of surveys in enterprises and other sources, in order to minimise the burden on respondents and keep administration simple.  EU countries lay down the procedures for enterprises to reply to the survey by the prescribed deadlines. Other sources of data may be used where deemed appropriate in terms of timeliness and relevance.   Survey characteristics and approach   EU countries must ensure that the data they transmit accurately reflect the structure of the population of the statistical units. The survey must be conducted in such a way as to permit a breakdown of the results at EU level of at least the following categories:   economic activities   size of enterprise.   The  European Commission  (  Eurostat  ) decides on the sampling requirements, the sample sizes to meet those requirements and the detailed specifications of the NACE and size categories into which the results can be broken down. The Commission also decides on the specific data to be collected with respect to training  *  and non-training enterprises  *  and to the different forms of vocational training.   Quality control   EU countries are responsible for ensuring the quality of the data they transmit to Eurostat. After each reference period of 1 calendar year, they must, within 21 months, submit a quality report to Eurostat containing all the information and data requested. The report should also mention whether there have been any breaches in the methodological requirements. On the basis of these reports, Eurostat assesses the quality of the data transmitted in order to ensure its comparability.   Periodicity   EU countries must collect the data every 5 years.   Transmission of data   EU countries send the individual data on enterprises to Eurostat in accordance with the EU legislation on data transmission, subject to statistical confidentiality, as set out in Regulation (EC) No  223/2009  . They must ensure that the data sent do not permit the direct identification of the statistical units. Transmission is in an electronic form and in accordance with specifications agreed by the  European Statistical System Committee  , a committee that assists and advises Eurostat comprising representatives from EU countries and chaired by the Commission .  EU countries must transmit the complete and correct data no later than 18 months after the end of each reference year.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 20 October 2005.   background   For more information, see:    Vocational education and training statistics  (  Eurostat  )    Continuing vocational training survey  (  Eurostat  ).   key terms    Enterprise:  the statistical unit used by Eurostat for observing and analysing the EU’s production system.   NACE classification:  abbreviation for the EU’s classification of economic activities, from the French  Nomenclature statistique des activités économiques  .   Training enterprises:  enterprises covered by the sampling that supply training services.   Non-training enterprises:  enterprises covered by the sampling but whose business is not to supply training services.
   Iceland – Information society and media     Iceland – Information society and media     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM(2011) 666      final – SEC(2011) 1202 final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The       2011 Report      provides a positive assessment of the application of the European Union (EU) rules, which is largely due to Iceland’s participation in the       European Economic Area      (EEA) and in European programmes.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission’s words)      The       acquis      includes specific rules relating to       electronic communications      ,       information society services      , particularly e-commerce and services based on conditional access, and to audiovisual services. In the field of electronic communications, the       acquis      aims at removing the obstacles preventing the smooth running of the internal market of telecommunications services and networks, at encouraging competition and at protecting consumers’ interests, specifically by guaranteeing the universal availability of modern services.     In terms of       audiovisual policy      , the       acquis      requires legislative alignment with the       Television without Frontiers Directive      which creates the conditions for the free movement of television programmes in the European Union. The       acquis      intends to define a transparent, reliable and efficient regulatory framework for public and private broadcasting which meets European standards. It also estimates the capacity for participating in the Community programmes Media Plus and Media Training.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      The country has already achieved a satisfactory level of alignment and has already applied a significant part of the EU       acquis      in the fields of       information      and       media      . However, the revised European framework for the regulation of communications still needs to be transposed. Similarly, several gaps need to be filled with regard to transposing the rules of audiovisual policy and information society policy.

summary of   Regulation (EU) No 650/2012 on matters of succession and on the creation of a European Certificate of Succession   summary    what does the regulation do   It provides legal certainty to beneficiaries of international successions, avoids conflicting decisions and simplifies proceedings. It thus makes it easier for beneficiaries in another EU country to enjoy the rights which have been granted or transferred to them by succession.   It establishes EU-wide rules on jurisdiction and on the applicable law governing succession matters in the EU, as well as rules on recognition and enforcement of decisions given in an EU country and the acceptance and the enforcement of formal legal documents issued in an EU country.   It also introduces a European Certificate of Succession to be used by heirs, legatees, executors of wills or administrators of the estate to demonstrate their status and/or exercise their rights or powers in another EU country.   It applies to all EU countries, except the UK (   1   ), Ireland and Denmark which will continue to apply their national law to international successions. The other EU countries will apply their national rules on recognition and enforcement to decisions given in these 3 countries.   It applies to deaths on or after 17 August 2015.   key points    Scope   The regulation applies to all  civil aspects  of the succession to the estates of deceased people.  It does not apply to:   revenue (for example, tax matters);   customs;   or administrative matters.   Areas of civil law other than succession, such as matrimonial property regimes, gifts and pension plans are not covered by the regulation.   Jurisdiction and applicable law    The courts of the EU country in which the deceased was usually living at the time of death will have jurisdiction to rule on the succession as a whole.   As a rule, the law applicable to the succession is the law of the country in which the deceased was usually living at their time of death. It can be the law of either an EU or non-EU country.   However, before their death, a person can instead choose that the applicable law should be the law of their country of nationality. If this person is a national of an EU country, the parties concerned by the succession may agree that the courts of that EU country should deal with the succession rather than the one in which the deceased was usually living.   The same law applies to the whole succession, irrespective of either the type of assets (moveable or immoveable) concerned or the country of their location.   The applicable law will govern, for example:   the determination of the beneficiaries and their respective shares;   the capacity to inherit;   the powers of the heirs, the executors of the wills and the administrators of the estate;   the liability for the debts under the succession;   the sharing-out of the estate.    Recognition and enforcement   The application of a single law by a single authority to an international succession avoids parallel proceedings, with possibly conflicting judicial decisions. It also ensures that  decisions  given in an EU country are  recognised  throughout the EU without need for any special procedure. Decisions  enforceable  in the EU country where they have been given are enforceable in another EU country when, on the application of an interested party, they have been declared enforceable there by the local court.   European Certificate of Succession    The European Certificate of Succession (ECS) is an  optional document  issued by the authority dealing with the succession.   It is for use by heirs, legatees, executors of wills or administrators of the estate who, in another EU country, need to demonstrate their status and/or exercise their rights as heirs or legatees or their powers as executors of wills or administrators of the estate.   Once issued, the ECS will be recognised  in all EU countries without any special procedure being required  .   In contrast with national certificates of succession, which have different effects depending on the EU country of issue, the ECS will have the same effects, set out in the regulation, in all EU countries.   Regulation (EU) No  1329/2014  sets out the  forms  to be used to accompany this Regulation, in particular the ECS.   from when does the regulation apply  It entered into force on 5 July 2012.   background   For more information, see the  e-Justice Portal   act   Regulation (EU) No  650/2012  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition and enforcement of decisions and acceptance and enforcement of authentic instruments in matters of succession and on the creation of a European Certificate of Succession (OJ L 201, 27.7.2012, pp. 107-134)  Successive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 650/2012 have been incorporated into the original text.

   Ceramic objects in contact with foodstuffs     Ceramic objects in contact with foodstuffs     Ceramics can transfer toxins (lead and cadmium) to foodstuffs with which they are in contact. Only ceramic objects intended to come into contact with foodstuffs must be accompanied by a written declaration from the manufacturer or seller stating that they do not exceed the maximum limits for the transfer of lead and cadmium.     ACT     Council Directive       84/500/EEC      of 15 October 1984 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to ceramic articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     Ceramic objects used to contain foodstuffs may transfer lead and cadmium to these foodstuffs. These two metals are toxic and can constitute a risk to human health.     The Directive lays down maximum limits for the cadmium and lead transferred by ceramic objects to the foodstuffs with which they enter into contact.      Declaration of conformity      To be sold, these ceramics must be accompanied by a written declaration provided by the manufacturer or importer, guaranteeing that they do not exceed the maximum limits for lead and cadmium. The information required is described in Annex II (introduced by Directive       2005/31/EC)      .     The declaration was introduced to meet the requirements of       Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004      on materials and articles intended to come into contact with food (Directive       84/500/EEC      is a measure specific to the groups of materials and objects listed in Regulation (EC) No       1935/2004      ).     The maximum limits for lead and cadmium must be checked by means of a test and a method of analysis (Annex III, introduced by Directive       2005/31/EC)      .

summary of   Directive 96/71/EC concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services    Directive 2014/67/EU on the enforcement of Directive 96/71/EC concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services    Directive (EU) 2020/1057 laying down specific rules with respect to Directive 96/71/EC and Directive 2014/67/EU for posting drivers in the road transport sector and amending Directive 2006/22/EC as regards enforcement requirements and Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012   what is the aim of the directives    Directive 96/71/EC  draws up a list of working conditions which workers who are temporarily posted abroad by their employer must be granted in the country to which they are posted (host country). Its purpose is to guarantee the protection of workers as well as provide a level playing field for service providers.    Directive 2014/67/EU  aims to improve the implementation and enforcement of Directive 96/71/EC. It addresses issues such as abuse and circumvention of posting rules, joint liability in subcontracting chains and sharing of information between EU countries.    Amending Directive (EU) 2018/957  updates and amends Directive 96/71/EC. It lays down rules regarding working conditions and the protection of posted workers’ health and safety, and seeks to ensure fair wages and a level playing field between posting and local companies in the host country, whilst maintaining the principle of free movement of services.    Directive (EU) 2020/1057  lays down specific rules for posting of professional drivers in the commercial road transport sector and for the effective enforcement of these rules. The directive provides the rules that are better adapted to the highly mobile nature of work in the road transport sector. It aims to remove discrepancies between EU countries’ interpretation, application and enforcement of the rules on the posting of workers in the road transport sector. It is designed to make the road transport sector fair, efficient and socially accountable, whilst at the same time offering greater legal certainty, easing the administrative burden for transport operators and preventing distortions in competition.   key points    Directive 96/71/EC    Directive 96/71/EC applies to undertakings which, in the context of the transnational provision of services, post workers to the territory of an EU country provided that there is an employment relationship between the undertaking making the posting and the worker during the period of the posting. A ‘posted worker’ is a worker who, for a limited period, works in the territory of an EU country other than the one in which they normally work.   To protect posted workers’  rights  when companies use the freedom to provide services and to facilitate the exercise of that freedom, Directive 96/71/EC contains  core employment conditions  that must be applied to posted workers in the host country, such as:   maximum work periods and minimum rest periods;   minimum paid annual holidays;   applicable minimum rates of pay, including overtime rates;   health, safety and hygiene at work.      Directive 2014/67/EU    Better prevention, monitoring and sanctioning of any abuse of the applicable rules    To help fight  abuse and circumvention  of the rules (for example, via letter-box companies  *  ), Directive 2014/67/EU contains a list of factual elements to help assess whether a specific situation qualifies as a genuine posting.   For greater  legal certainty  , Directive 2014/67/EU lays down a list of  national control measures  that are considered justified and proportionate and that may be applied in order to monitor the compliance of Directive 96/71/EC and the enforcement directive (Directive 2014/67/EU) itself.   To increase the  protection of workers’ rights in subcontracting chains  , EU countries must ensure that posted workers in the construction sector can hold the contractor in a direct subcontractor relationship liable for any outstanding net remuneration corresponding to the minimum rates of pay, in addition to or in place of the employer. Instead of these liability rules, EU countries may take other appropriate enforcement measures.    Improved access to information    To increase  awareness  and  transparency  , EU countries are obliged to make available and free of charge any information on the terms and conditions of employment and on collective agreements applicable to posted workers via a  single official national website  . The information must be made public in the official language(s) of the host country and in the most relevant languages, taking into account demand in its labour market.    Enhanced administrative cooperation    Directive 2014/67/EU also includes clearer rules to improve  administrative cooperation  between national authorities in charge of monitoring compliance, including time limits for the supply of information. The  Internal Market Information (IMI) regulation  comes into play here. The  IMI system  is a multilingual electronic tool that allows national, regional and local authorities to communicate quickly and easily with their counterparts in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway about EU internal market law.   Directive 2014/67/EU also ensures that administrative penalties and fines imposed on service providers for failure to respect the applicable rules in one EU country can be enforced and recovered in another.    Amending Directive (EU) 2018/957   Amending Directive (EU) 2018/957 introduces a number of new rules:   the same rules regarding remuneration apply to posted workers as to local workers in the host country;   a worker will be considered to be posted long term after 12 months (with the possibility of a 6-month extension subject to a motivated notification by the service provider), after which the posted worker will be subject to nearly all aspects of the labour law of the host country;   the number of potential collective agreements that may apply in EU countries having a system for declaring collective agreements or arbitration awards of universal application may be increased;   temporary work agencies must guarantee posted workers the same terms and conditions that apply to temporary workers hired in the country where the work is carried out;   improved cooperation between EU countries’ authorities regarding abuse and circumvention of rules in the context of posting.    Directive (EU) 2020/1057   Among the changes introduced by Directive (EU) 2020/1057 are:   an exception from the general posting rules applying to cabotage and international transport operations, with the exception of transit, ‘bilateral transport operations’ (both in goods and passenger transport) and bilateral operations with 2 additional carriage-related stops — this exception is restricted to cases where a service contract exists between the employer sending the driver and a party operating in the host EU country;   administrative rules relating to posting of drivers, control and enforcement — hauliers must use the IMI system to send posting declarations and any requested information;   penalties in the event of infringements;   ‘smart enforcement’, which requires EU countries to integrate the control of posting rules into an overall control strategy;   rules ensuring that strengthening posting rules for EU drivers does not result in a competitive advantage for non-EU operators having access to the EU road transport market.   from when do the directives apply    Directive 96/71/EC  has applied since 10 February 1997 and had to become law in the EU countries by 16 December 1999.    Directive 2014/67/EU  has applied since 17 June 2014 and had to become law in the EU countries by 18 June 2016.    Amending Directive (EU) 2018/957  had to become law in the EU countries by 30 July 2020. However, it will only apply to the road transport sector from the date of application of a legislative act that has been adopted to amend Directives  2006/22/EC  and 2014/67/EU concerning the posting of drivers in the road transport sector. This is Directive (EU) 2020/1057, which will apply from 2 February 2022.    Directive (EU) 2020/1057  has to become law in the EU countries by 2 February 2022.   background   For more information, see:    Posted workers  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Letter-box companies:  companies that have been set up with the purpose of benefiting from legislative loopholes while not themselves providing any service to clients, but rather provide a front for services provided by their owners (European Commission in  COM(2013) 122 final  ).   main documents   Directive  96/71/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1996 concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services (OJ L 18, 21.1.1997, pp. 1-6)  Successive amendments to Directive 96/71/EC have been incorporated into the original text.

   An Energy Policy for Europe     An Energy Policy for Europe     A European Energy Policy will firmly commit the European Union (EU) to a low consumption economy based on more secure, more competitive and more sustainable energy. Priority energy objectives involve ensuring the smooth functioning of the internal market in energy, security of strategic supply, concrete reductions in greenhouse gas emissions caused by the production or consumption of energy and the EU's ability to speak with a single voice on the international stage.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Council and the European Parliament of 10 January 2007, "An energy policy for Europe" [       COM(2007) 1      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This Communication, a strategic review of the European energy situation, introduces a complete set of European Energy Policy measures (the 'energy' package).      JUSTIFICATIONS FOR A EUROPEAN ENERGY POLICY      The European Union (EU) faces serious energy challenges concerning sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions as well as security of supply, import dependence and the competitiveness and effective implementation of the internal energy market.     A European Energy Policy is acknowledged as the most effective response to these challenges, which are faced by all Member States.     The EU intends to lead a new industrial revolution and create a high efficiency energy economy with low CO2 emissions. To do so, it has set itself several important energy objectives.      ESTABLISH THE INTERNAL ENERGY MARKET      An internal energy market has been developed on a Community level to ensure that consumers have the opportunity to choose a supplier, at a fair and competitive price. Nevertheless, as highlighted by the Communication on prospects for the internal energy market and the inquiry into competition in the gas and electricity sectors, there are obstacles which continue to prevent both the economy and European consumers from fully benefiting from the advantages of opening up the gas and electricity markets. Ensuring the effective implementation of the internal energy market thus remains crucial.      A competitive market      There must be a clearer separation between the management of gas and electricity networks and production or sales activities.     If a company controls the management of networks as well as production or sales, there is a serious risk of discrimination and abuse. A vertically integrated company has little interest in increasing the capacity of the network and thereby exposing itself to increased competition on the market and a consequent fall in prices.     A separation between the management of networks and production or sales will encourage companies to invest more in networks, thereby promoting the entry onto the market of new arrivals and increasing security of supply.     This separation may either be achieved through the establishment of an Independent System Operator responsible for the maintenance, development and operation of the networks, which remain the property of the vertically integrated companies, or through full ownership unbundling.      An integrated and interconnected market      The internal energy market is essentially dependent on cross-border trade in energy. However, such trade is often difficult because of the disparity between national technical standards and differences in network capacity.     Effective regulation on a Community level is required. The competences and independence of energy regulators need to be harmonised, their collaboration must be reinforced and they must be obliged to take into account the Community objective of realising the internal energy market and defining regulatory and technical aspects and common security standards required for cross-border trade on a Community level.     With the goal of making the European energy network a reality, the Priority Interconnection Plan highlights the importance of financial and political support for implementing the infrastructures which have been identified as essential and of nominating European coordinators for monitoring the most problematic priority projects.      An energy public service      The EU is determined to persevere with its fight against energy poverty by developing an Energy Customers' Charter. The charter will principally encourage the implementation of aid schemes for the most vulnerable citizens in the face of increasing energy prices and also the improvement of the level of information consumers receive concerning the different suppliers and supply options.      ENSURE A SECURE ENERGY SUPPLY      Minimising the EU's vulnerability concerning imports, shortfalls in supply, possible energy crises and uncertainty with respect to future supply is a clear priority. This uncertainty is all the more problematic for Member States dependent on one single gas supplier.     The new energy policy emphasises the importance of measures which ensure solidarity between Member States and of the diversification of supply sources and transportation routes.     Measures supporting strategic oil stocks must be reinforced and the possibilities for improving the security of gas supply must be explored. Increased security of electricity supply, which remains crucial, must also be guaranteed.      REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS      Energy accounts for 80 % of all greenhouse gas emissions in the EU.     Determined to fight against climate change, the EU is committed to reducing its own emissions by at least 20 % by 2020. It also calls for the conclusion of an international agreement which will oblige developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 30 % by 2020. In the framework of this agreement, the EU would set itself a new objective of reducing its own emissions by 30 % compared with 1990 levels. These objectives are at the heart of the EU's       strategy for limiting climate change      .     Of course, reducing greenhouse gas emissions involves using less energy and using more clean energy.      Energy efficiency      Reducing its energy consumption by 20 % by 2020 is the objective the EU has set itself in its       Action Plan for Energy Efficiency      (2007-2012).     Concrete effort needs to be made to achieve this objective, in particular with respect to energy saving in the transport sector, the development of minimum efficiency requirements for energy-using appliances, awareness-raising amongst consumers about sensible and economic energy use, improving the efficiency of the production, transport and distribution of heating and electricity and also developing energy technologies and improving the energy performance of buildings.     The EU also intends to achieve a common approach on a global scale for saving energy through the conclusion of an international agreement on energy efficiency.      Renewable energy      The use of renewable energies (wind power, solar and photovoltaic energy, biomass and biofuels, geothermal energy and heat-pump systems) undeniably contributes to limiting climate change. Furthermore, it plays a part in securing energy supply and creating employment in Europe, thanks to the increase in the production and consumption of local energy.     Renewable energies, however, remain on the fringe of the European energy mix as they still cost more than traditional energy sources.     To increase the use of renewable energy sources, in its       Renewable Energies Roadmap      the EU has set itself the objective of increasing the proportion of renewable energies in its energy mix by 20 % by 2020.     This objective requires progress to be made in the three main sectors where renewable energies are used: electricity (increasing the       production of electricity from renewable sources      and allowing the sustainable production of electricity from fossil fuels, principally through the implementation of CO2 capture and storage systems),       biofuels      , which should represent 10 % of vehicle fuels by 2020, and finally heating and cooling systems.      DEVELOP ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES      Energy technologies play a central role in offering both competitiveness and sustainability in the energy sector while increasing security of supply. They are likewise crucial for attaining the other energy objectives.     The EU, today a global leader in the renewable energy sector, intends to consolidate its position and play an equally leading role in the rapidly growing market for low carbon energy technologies.     The EU must therefore develop existing energy-efficient technologies as well as new technologies, in particular those devoted to energy efficiency and renewable energies.     Even if the EU considerably diversifies its energy mix, it will still be highly dependent on oil and coal and must thus also pay particular attention to low carbon-output fossil fuel technologies, especially carbon capture and storage systems.     Investment in these emerging technologies will directly contribute to the Community strategy for increasing employment.     The Commission proposes an outline for a European Strategic Energy Technology Plan which will cover the entire innovation process, from the initial research to entry onto the market. This strategic plan will support the       Seventh Framework Programme for Research      , which foresees a 50 % increase in spending on research in the energy sector, along with the       Intelligent Energy for Europe programme      .      CONSIDER THE FUTURE OF NUCLEAR ENERGY      Faced with increasing concerns with regard to security of supply and CO2 emissions, nuclear energy has the benefit of being one of the low-carbon energy sources offering the most stable costs and supply.     The decision whether or not to use nuclear energy is made by Member States. Nevertheless, the illustrative nuclear programme emphasises the need to have a common and coherent approach with respect to security, safety and non-proliferation as well as concerning the dismantling of installations and the management of waste.      IMPLEMENT A COMMON INTERNATIONAL ENERGY POLICY      The EU is not able to achieve the objective of secure, competitive and sustainable energy alone. To do so requires the involvement and cooperation of both developed and developing countries, energy consumers and producers and countries of transit. To ensure efficiency and coherence, it is crucial that Member States and the EU are able to speak with a single voice on international energy issues.     The EU will be a driving force in the development of international energy agreements, in particular by strengthening the       European Energy Charter      , taking the initiative in an agreement on energy efficiency and participating actively in the post-Kyoto climate change scheme.     EU relations with consumer countries (such as the       United States      ,       India      ,       Brazil      or       China      ), producer countries (       Russia      ,       Norway      ,       OPEC      countries and Algeria, for example) and countries of transit (such as the       Ukraine      ) are of prime importance from the perspective of geopolitical security and economic stability. The EU will thus strive to develop energy partnerships with these countries which are transparent, predictable and reciprocal, in particular with its neighbouring countries. The EU also proposes a new partnership with Africa which will deal with a large variety of energy issues.     The EU is committed to helping developing countries to implement decentralised energy services which are low-cost, reliable and sustainable. The EU encourages these countries, in particular Africa, to immediately invest in renewable energies and the new generation of clean energy technologies.      BACKGROUND      The development of a European energy policy was at the heart of the European project, with the ECSC Treaty (establishing the European Coal and Steel Community) in 1951 and the Euratom Treaty (establishing the European Atomic Energy Community) in 1957. Despite economic and geopolitical changes since, it remains essential today.     The Energy Package presented by the European Commission on 10 January 2007 is part of the movement begun by the       Green Paper on a European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy      in March 2006 and once again places energy at the heart of European activities.     Based on the Energy Package, the Heads of State and Government at the spring European Council on 9 March 2007 adopted a       comprehensive energy Action Plan for the period 2007-2009      .

summary of   Directive 2014/94/EU — deploying the EU’s alternative fuels infrastructure   summary    what does this directive do        —     It establishes  standard rules  on rolling out the EU’s alternative fuels* infrastructure (i.e. electric car recharging stations or natural gas refuelling points) in the different EU countries.            —     It lays down  minimum requirements  for building up this infrastructure, to be implemented as part of every EU country’s national policy framework.      key points   EU countries must adopt national policies that aim to develop the  market  for alternative transport fuels and the  infrastructure to support them  . In drawing up these policies, EU countries must:        —     make an  assessment  of the current state of the market and prospects for future development;            —     set  national targets  for deploying the infrastructure and the measures necessary to meet them;            —     designate  networks  for this infrastructure.       Key dates   Countries must provide the following, by the following dates.        —      2020  — sufficient recharging stations to allow  electric cars  to travel around densely populated areas within the network the country has determined.            —      2025  (end) — sufficient recharging stations for  hydrogen  (for any country that decides to include hydrogen in its national policy framework).            —      2025  (end) — sufficient  liquefied natural gas  (LNG) stations at seaports, to accommodate LNG-powered ships.       Reporting   EU countries are required to submit a  progress report  to the European Commission on the implementation of their national frameworks by 2019, and every 3 years after that.   background   See also:        —      Alternative fuels             —      Roadmap on resource-efficient transport (2011)             —      Directive 2009/28/EC  (  target of 10 % market share for renewables in transport fuels  )      key terms    * Alternative fuels  means fuels or power sources that serve, at least partly, as a substitute for fossil oil sources.

   Exemptions from consultations on passenger tariffs and slot allocation at airports     Exemptions from consultations on passenger tariffs and slot allocation at airports     1) OBJECTIVE     To exempt, subject to certain conditions, consultations on passenger tariffs and slot allocation at airports from the competition rules.     2) ACT     Commission Regulation (EEC) No       1617/93      of 25 June 1993 on the application of Article 85(3) of the Treaty to certain categories of agreements and concerted practices concerning joint planning and coordination of schedules, joint operations, consultations on passenger and cargo tariffs on scheduled air services and slot allocation at airports [Official Journal L 155 of 26.06.1993].     Amended by the following measures:     Commission Regulation (EC) No       1105/2002      of 25 June 2002 amending Regulation (EEC) No       1617/93      as regards consultations on passenger tariffs and slot allocation at airports [Official Journal L 167 of 26.06.2002];     Commission Regulation (EC) No       1083/1999      of 26 May 1999 amending Regulation (EEC) No       1617/93      on the application of Article 85(3) of the Treaty to certain categories of agreements and concerted practices concerning joint planning and coordination of schedules, joint operations, consultations on passenger and cargo tariffs on scheduled air services and slot allocation at airports [Official Journal L 131 of 27.05.1999];     Commission Regulation (EC) No       1523/96      of 24 July 1996 amending Regulation (EEC) No       1617/93      on the application of Article 85(3) of the Treaty to certain categories of agreements and concerted practices concerning joint planning and coordination of schedules, joint operations, consultations on passenger and cargo tariffs on scheduled air services and slot allocation at airports [Official Journal L 190 of 31.07.1996].     3) SUMMARY      Background      Under       Regulation No 3976/87      , which authorises the Commission to grant block exemptions to certain categories of agreements and concerted practices which relate directly or indirectly to the provision of air transport services, this Regulation is designed to exempt consultations on passenger tariffs and slot allocation at airports from Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty. The Commission may withdraw the benefit of the block exemption.      Scope      In 1993 the scope of this Regulation was broad enough to include agreements and concerted practices concerning joint planning and coordination of schedules, joint operations, consultations on tariffs and slot allocation at airports which could restrict competition and affect trade between Member States. Numerous successive amendments significantly reduced the scope of this Regulation. It is now limited to consultations on passenger tariffs and slot allocation at airports.      Conditions governing application      The exemption concerning the organisation of consultations on passenger tariffs applies on condition that:      participants discuss passenger tariffs only;       for each tariff category and for the seasons covered by consultations, passengers are able to combine the service with services on the same route on the same ticket and, in so far as circumstances allow, to replace or change reservations;       passenger tariffs are applied on a non-discriminatory basis;       participation in consultations is optional and open to all air carriers;       consultations are not binding on participants, which means that participants must maintain, after consultations have ended, the right to act independently on passenger tariffs;       consultations do not give rise to an agreement on staff pay or other aspects of tariffs covered by the discussion;       where tariffs have to be notified, each participant informs the competent authorities of the Member States concerned, on an individual basis, of any tariff not covered by the consultations.      The exemption concerning slot allocation and scheduling applies on condition that:      consultations are open to all air carriers;       priority rules are drawn up and applied without any discrimination;       the priority rules are made available to any interested party on request;       new arrivals are entitled to 50% of new or unused slots;       by the time of these consultations at the latest, the participating carriers have access to the information.      Air carriers must notify the Member States concerned and the Commission of the date, place and subject of these consultations at least ten days in advance so that observers from the Commission and the Member States can take part in them.

   Reduction of pollution caused by waste from the titanium dioxide industry     Reduction of pollution caused by waste from the titanium dioxide industry     This Directive sets up, according to Article 9 (3) of       Directive 78/176/EEC      , procedures for the harmonisation of programmes for the reduction of pollution caused by waste from existing industrial establishments, and improves the conditions of competition in the sector of titanium dioxide production.     ACT     Council Directive       92/112/EEC      of 15 December 1992 on procedures for harmonizing the programmes for the reduction and eventual elimination of pollution caused by waste from the titanium dioxide industry.     SUMMARY     The Directive is intended to fill the legal void created by the annulment of Council Directive       89/428/EEC      (Official Journal L 201 of 14.07.1989) by the Court of Justice of the European Communities.     The Directive applies to solid waste, strong acid waste, weak acid waste, neutralized waste, treatment waste and dust. The processes covered are the sulphate process and the chloride process. The Directive also concerns dumping.     The dumping of any waste from ships or aircraft was prohibited as of 15 June 1993.     Discharges into territorial waters and the high sea of solid waste and strong acid waste from existing industrial establishments using either process and of treatment waste from existing industrial establishments using the sulphate process are prohibited from 15 June 1993.     Discharges into any waters of waste other than that referred to at point 4 above is reduced to limit values laid down by the Directive. Member States may choose to make use of quality objectives coupled with appropriate limit values, provided they demonstrate, in a programme presented to the Commission, that the measures achieve an equivalent effect in terms of protecting the environment and avoiding distortion of competition. The Member States must ensure that this reduction is achieved by 31 December 1993 or, under certain conditions, by 31 December 1994 for the sulphate process, and by 15 June 1993 for the chlorine process.     The Member States must ensure that discharges into the atmosphere are reduced in accordance with limit values laid down by the Directive.     The Member States monitor compliance with the limit values.     The Member States are subject to the general obligation to avoid or reuse the waste referred to by the Directive or, failing that, to dispose of it. Their actions must not endanger human health or harm the environment.

summary of   Council Framework Decision 2006/783/JHA — applying the principle of mutual recognition to confiscation orders   what is the aim of the framework decision  It allows a judicial authority in one European Union (EU) country to send an order to freeze or confiscate property directly to the judicial authority in another EU country where it will be recognised and carried out without any further formality.   key points    What is a confiscation order?   It is a  permanent  measure to take illegally obtained property away from criminals or their accomplices.   Offences    For a number of  serious offences,years  it is not necessary for the offence to be a crime in both the EU country issuing the order (  issuing countryyears  ) and the one carrying it out (  executing countryyears  ). However, the offence must be punishable in the issuing country by a jail sentence of a maximum period of at least  3years  . The offences include:   participation in a criminal organisation;   terrorism;   corruption and fraud;   trafficking in human beings;   racism and xenophobia;   rape.      Transmission    A confiscation order for  money or property  may be sent to the EU country where it has  reasonable grounds  to believe the person or company concerned has property or income. If there are  no reasonable grounds  , the order may be sent to the EU country in which the person is resident or the company has its registered seat.   A confiscation order  concerning property  may be sent to more than one EU country at the same time where:   there are reasonable grounds to believe that different items covered by the order are held in several EU countries;   confiscation of a specific item involves action in more than one EU country; or   the item concerned may be located in one of two or more EU countries.     A confiscation order  concerning money  may be sent to more than one EU country at the same time where:   the property concerned has not been frozen under  Council Framework Decision 2003/577/JHA  ; or   the value of the property to be confiscated in the issuing state and in any one executing state is not likely to be enough to cover the full amount of the confiscation order.      Recognition and execution    The judicial authority of the issuing country must send a  certificate,  based on the standard form annexed to this decision, to the judicial authority of the executing country to request execution of the order.   The executing country must recognise the order without further formality and take the necessary steps to execute it immediately.    Non-recognition and non-execution   Execution of an order  may be refused  if the certificate is not produced, is incomplete or clearly does not correspond to the order. It may also be refused in a number of other situations including where:   execution would be against rules protecting citizens from being prosecuted twice for the same offence;   the order is  not an offence  in the executing country;   there is  immunity or privilege  under the law of the executing country which prevents the execution of a confiscation order on the property;   under the law of the executing country, the offence is considered to have taken place wholly or partly within its territory;   the offence was not committed in the territory of the issuing state and, under the law of the executing state, this is not considered grounds for legal proceedings.    Postponing execution   Execution may be postponed in several cases including where:   it might damage an ongoing criminal investigation;   the property is already the subject of confiscation proceeding in the executing country;   the order or part of the order needs to be translated.    Interested parties   EU countries must ensure that any interested party, including legitimate third parties, have legal remedies against the recognition and execution of a confiscation order, in order to preserve their rights.   from when does the framework decision apply  It has applied since 24 November 2006 EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 24 November 2008.   background     Confiscation and freezing of assets  .
summary of   Regulation (EC) No 716/2007 — EU statistics on the structure and activity of foreign affiliates   what is the aim of the regulation  It aims to create common statistical standards for the systematic production of comparable statistics on the structure and activity of foreign affiliates  *  .   key points    Definitions     Foreign affiliates statistics (FATS)  measure the commercial presence through affiliates in foreign markets.    Inward FATS  describe the overall activity of foreign affiliates resident in the compiling country (see Annex I of the regulation).    Outward FATS  describe the overall activity of foreign affiliates abroad controlled by residents of the compiling country, for example how many employees work in affiliates resident outside the EU and controlled by European enterprises (see Annex II of the regulation).   FATS are compiled according to the  ultimate controlling institutional unit  concept. This refers to an institutional unit (enterprise, branch or natural person) under a foreign affiliate’s chain of control and not controlled by another institutional unit.    Scope   EU countries must submit to the European Commission (  Eurostat  ) data on foreign affiliates in regard to their  characteristics  ,  economic activities  and  geographical breakdown  (see Annex III of the regulation).  The countries collect data on  11 characteristics  , including:   number of foreign-controlled enterprises (i.e. an enterprise in one country controlled by a resident of another country);   turnover;   production value;   added value;   total purchases of goods and services;   staff costs;   gross investment in tangible goods;   number of persons employed;   total on-site research and development (R & D) expenditure; and   total number of R & D staff.    Data sources   EU countries have to collect the required information using  relevant  and  appropriate  sources. Business registers, statistical surveys or already existing data from administrative sources are the main sources for FATS statistics (see summary of   Business statistics   ). Where the required data cannot be collected at a reasonable cost, best estimates, including zero values, may be transmitted to Eurostat.   Quality standards and reports   EU countries must ensure that the quality of the data they transmit to Eurostat meets common quality standards. The  European Commission  (Eurostat) specifies the quality standards to be met and the content and frequency of  quality reports  to be submitted.   Recommendations manual   In close cooperation with EU countries, Eurostat prepares a  manual  containing the relevant definitions and supplementary guidance with regard to the production of FATS.   Timetable   A timetable for compiling the data is specified in the regulation’s Annexes I and II.   Committees   The Commission (Eurostat) is assisted and advised by the  European Statistical System Committee  , a committee of EU countries. In implementing this regulation, the Commission can also request the opinion of the  Committee on Monetary, Financial and Balance of Payments Statistics  on all matters falling within that committee’s competence, in particular about measures for adjustment to economic and technical developments concerning the collection and statistical processing of data and the processing and transmission of results.   Implementation report   In 2012 the Commission was to submit a report to the  European Parliament  and the  Council  on the implementation of the regulation.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 19 July 2007.   background   Although statistics on foreign direct investment record the total amount of capital invested by foreign companies in the EU, FATS provide more detailed information on the economic impact of those investments in terms of job creation, R & D, etc.  For more information, see:    Foreign affiliates (foreign-controlled enterprises)  (  Eurostat  ).   key terms    Foreign affiliate:  an enterprise resident in a country which is under the control of an institutional unit not resident in the same country.
summary of  Regulation (EU) No  528/2012  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2012 concerning the making available on the market and use of biocidal products   summary   Biocidal products (household disinfectants, insecticides and other chemicals) are used to suppress pests (parasites, fungi, bacteria, etc.) or to protect materials. However, as their properties can pose risks to humans, animals and the environment, they are regulated at European Union level.   what does this regulation do  It harmonises the EU’s rules concerning the sale and use of biocidal products, while ensuring high levels of protection of human and animal health and of the environment.   key points    Approval   In order to be allowed to be sold in the EU, all biocidal products require a permit. The  active ingredients  that they contain must also be approved.  The evaluation of biocides' active substances is carried out at EU level. For each active substance that needs to be evaluated, an EU country is appointed ‘rapporteur’ . It is responsible for producing an evaluation report which is then discussed by all the EU countries with a view to reaching a decision at EU level to approve (or not) the substance.  Active substances that meet the exclusion criteria are not approved. These are substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction, endocrine disruptors, persistent*, bioaccumulative* and toxic* (PBT) or very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB). Exemptions are possible, however, if the risks are negligible.  The risks associated with nanomaterial biocides* must be specifically assessed.  The approval of an active substance is granted for a period not exceeding 10 years.  Approved active substances are listed on the  European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) website  .   Authorisation   Once an active substance is approved, companies must apply for permission to place their products on the market in one of the following ways.        —     By submitting a request for  EU authorisation  with the ECHA: if the product is deemed safe, it can be sold directly throughout the EU without the need to obtain specific national authorisation.            —     By submitting a request for  national authorisation  if the product is to be sold in a single country. If permission is granted, companies can put the product on the market of other EU countries based on the principle of  mutual recognition of the authorisation of the product  .      There is also a  simplified authorisation procedure  for the least harmful products that meet certain criteria, such as those that do not contain substances of concern or nanomaterials.   Data sharing   To minimise costs and the use of animal testing, the regulation requires the sharing of data on approved substances and products authorised in the EU. The agency has therefore set up an information system (  Register for Biocidal Products  ).   Treated objects   The regulation covers articles that have been treated with or containing a biocidal product (such as furniture and food packaging). Items can only be treated with active substances that have been approved in the EU and must be labelled as such.   when does the regulation apply  From 1 September 2013.   background         —      Biocides             —      Biocidal products regulation       key terms    * Persistent  : these are chemicals that persist in the environment (i.e. do not break down) and thus may damage human health. The pesticide DDT is an example.   * Bioaccumulative  : the accumulation of a substance such as a chemical in an organism. Bioaccumulation occurs when this substance is absorbed faster by the organism than it is eliminated.   * Toxic  : substances which may harm the environment or health if inhaled, ingested or absorbed through the skin.   * Nanomaterial biocide  : a biocide produced using a nanomaterial. Nanomaterials are chemical substances or materials that are manufactured and used on a very small scale. Nanomaterials have unique and more pronounced characteristics compared to the same material without nanoscale features (source: European Chemical Agency).

   Iceland – Environment     Iceland – Environment     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM(2011) 666      final – SEC(2011) 1202 final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The       2011 Report      presents a positive evaluation of Iceland’s alignment, which already applies a large part of the European Union (EU)       acquis      due to its participation in the       European Economic Area      (EEA). The country has also reinforced its administrative capacity in the field of the environment.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission’s words)      Community environment policy aims to promote sustainable development and protect the environment for present and future generations. It is based on the integration of environmental protection into other Community policies, preventive action, the polluter pays principle, fighting environmental damage at source and shared responsibility. The       acquis      comprises over 200 legal acts covering horizontal legislation, water and air pollution, management of waste and chemicals, biotechnology, nature protection, industrial pollution and risk management, and noise.     Ensuring compliance with the       acquis      requires significant investment, but also brings significant benefits for public health and reduces costly damage to forests, buildings, landscapes and fisheries. A strong and well-equipped administration at national, regional and local level is imperative for the application and enforcement of the environment       acquis      .      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      Iceland has made new progress, even though its level of alignment was already high with regard to the environment. For the most part, the institutional structures are in place and operational. Full compliance with the       acquis      on       nature protection      still needs to be finalised, particularly with regard to whales, seals and wild birds, and also the conservation of natural habitats, wild flora and fauna. This requirement also applies to the water sector, in particular to alignment with the Framework Directive on the marine strategy.     Additional progress is also required concerning       climate change      , including with regard to air transport and the Emissions Trading System.     In certain areas, Iceland must gradually align with the EU positions in international environmental fora. The country must also ratify the principal multilateral agreements on the environment.

   Action Plan on Adult learning - It's never too late to learn     Action Plan on Adult learning - It's never too late to learn     The purpose of this Action Plan is to develop an efficient adult learning system accessible to everyone. The main objectives relate to participation, the quality and efficiency of the system, recognition of the results of learning and the monitoring of this sector.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 27 September 2007 presenting the Action Plan on Adult learning - It is always a good time to learn [       COM(2007) 558      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Adult learning opportunities are not keeping pace with the needs of individuals and society. Investing in       lifelong learning      is essential, but the benchmark indicator for adult participation (age 25 to 64) in lifelong learning is stagnating rather than increasing in the European Union (EU).     The Action Plan aims to make lifelong learning a reality, with emphasis on the adult learning sector.     Adult learning concerns underqualified people or those whose professional skills are obsolete. This Action Plan aims to make it possible for them to acquire       key competences      at all stages in their lives.     In order to develop this Action Plan, the Communication draws on the results of a wide-ranging consultation organised in the first half of 2007 with the Member States, representatives of the Ministries of Education and Employment, social partners and NGOs involved in adult learning.      Implementation of the Action Plan      The method is based on the Open Method of Coordination (OMC), which offers a non-binding intergovernmental framework for exchange and concerted action. This method, which is appropriate for adult learning, entails identifying, disseminating and making use of most good practices established by the Member States by integrating them into the "       Education and Training 2010      " work programme and the Lifelong Learning Programme.     With the indispensable support of the Member States, the specific actions contained in the Action Plan involve:      analysing the reforms conducted in the Member States in all sectors of education and training and their effects on adult learning. The Commission intends to obtain national reports as of 2008 on these reforms. The results of these analyses will make it possible to conduct a thorough assessment of good practices and steer the lifelong learning programme and the resulting initiatives of the EU;       improving the quality of services in the adult learning sector. In order to encourage participation in adult learning, the Commission is focusing on the quality of staff (teachers, training instructors, career guidance personnel, advisers, managers and administrative staff). On the basis of the good practices identified and disseminated within the Member States, the Commission plans to develop a summary of key competences by 2009 for all adult learning professionals;       ensuring the efficiency and visibility of adult learning, i.e. encouraging the individuals concerned to participate more in adult learning by increasing the possibilities for them to gain a higher qualification. As of 2008, the Commission will draw on the results of a research inventory of national good practices and the results of the Community Lifelong Learning Programme, in particular those of the         Grundvig        Programme. A call for proposals for pilot projects to increase the visibility and efficiency of adult learning will be launched in 2009;       speeding up the process of implementing the European Qualifications Framework. This instrument ensures the validity and recognition of the results of learning by laying emphasis on the skills acquired outside the formal education system;       improving the monitoring of the sector. The Commission considers it urgent to establish a common understanding of adult learning in order to improve data comparison. Core data are required in order to organise regular monitoring (every two years) of the sector. This Action Plan involves working with the Member States to produce coherent terminology and creating a glossary of core data to be collected as of 2009 in Member States wishing to contribute to the development of the Action Plan.      By the end of 2007, a working group will be set up to help the Commission and the Member States develop actions and projects on the basis of the Action Plan. A conference will be organised in the second half of 2009 in order to make an initial assessment of implementation.      Background      The Commission bases its approach on the main challenges identified in the Communication on Adult learning - "It is never too late to learn".     The Joint Employment Report 2006/2007 observes that a substantial improvement in adult participation in       lifelong learning      has not yet been achieved.     By enhancing the employability and adaptability of workers, lifelong learning has become an indissociable element of support for European competitiveness.     Last updated: 31.10.2007  
summary of   EU Agenda for the Rights of the Child - COM(2011) 60 final   summary    what does this communication do  It presents an agenda to strengthen and protect children's rights as set out in the principles of the  EU Charter of Fundamental Rights  and the  United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child  (UNCRC). All EU policies which impact on children should respect their rights.   key points         —     Children's rights should be an integral part of EU policy making. This means that a ‘fundamental rights check’ is part of every piece of draft legislation.            —     The EU's different justice systems must become more child-friendly. This applies to        —     family law disputes,             —     registration of documents,             —     custody,             —     criminal and prison proceedings,             —     civil status and             —     treatment of children as vulnerable witnesses.                 —     Most vulnerable children need protection whether they are        —     disabled,             —     at risk of poverty,             —     victims of sexual exploitation or trafficking,             —     seeking asylum or             —     on their own.                 —     Advice should be given to experienced and well-trained professionals, who can help children handle the trauma they have experienced, to understand the rights and needs of the different age groups.            —     Special attention should be available to  Roma  children in the EU since they are particularly vulnerable and exposed.            —     The EU operates a  hotline (No: 116 000)  for missing children.            —     The EU is committed to enforcing children's rights worldwide to protect them from threats such as violence, child labour, armed conflict and sex tourism.            —     The EU makes sure        —     children are aware of their rights,             —     can voice their opinions,             —     are consulted and listened to, and             —     receive information about EU policies that could affect them.           background   Protecting the rights of the child are recognised in the Treaty on European Union (  Article 3(3)  and in the EU  Charter of Fundamental Rights  (Article 24).   act   Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: An EU Agenda for the Rights of the Child (  COM(2011) 60 final  of 15.2.2011)
summary of   Decision 2003/335/JHA — investigation and prosecution of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes   what does the decision do  It lays down a framework to improve cooperation between EU countries in the investigation and prosecution of actual or suspected perpetrators of genocide*, crimes against humanity* and war crimes*.   key points    EU countries are required to inform law enforcement authorities when there is a suspicion that an applicant for a residence permit has committed any of the crimes listed above. The authorities may then begin criminal proceedings in an EU country or in international criminal courts.   EU countries are to assist one another in investigating and prosecuting the crimes. To help with that process, they may set up specialist units within their law enforcement authorities.   EU countries are required to coordinate ongoing efforts to investigate and prosecute persons suspected of having committed or participated in the crimes listed above. The contact points of the  European Genocide Network  are to meet at regular intervals in order to exchange information about experiences, practices and methods. These meetings may take place in conjunction with  European Judicial Network  meetings.   This decision helps implement the  Rome Statute  of the  International Criminal Court  , which aims to ensure none of the crimes listed above go unpunished.   The  Eurojust  network aids the investigation and prosecution process.   from when does the decision apply  It has applied since 14 May 2003.   background   Following the genocide, crimes and against humanity and war crimes that took place in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Tribunals have been investigating, prosecuting and bringing to justice the perpetrators. However, successful outcomes of the investigation and prosecution of such crimes require close cooperation at international levels.   key terms    * Genocide  : acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group.   * Crimes against humanity  : acts committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against civilian populations.   * War crimes  : acts committed that violate the law of war (e.g. the Geneva Conventions). Examples include mistreating prisoners-of-war, killing hostages, or deliberately destroying cities, towns or villages.
   Accession Partnership with Croatia     Accession Partnership with Croatia     The purpose of the Accession Partnership is to assist the Croatian authorities in their efforts to meet the accession criteria, especially the political criteria (or Copenhagen criteria). It covers in detail the principles and priorities for the country’s accession preparations, with particular reference to implementation of the acquis, and forms the reference framework for programming pre-accession assistance from Community funds.     ACT     Council Decision       2008/119/EC      of 12 February 2008 on the principles, priorities and conditions contained in the Accession Partnership with Croatia and repealing Decision       2006/145/EC      .     SUMMARY     The Accession Partnership is the main instrument intended to provide the Croatian authorities with guidance in their preparations for accession to the European Union (EU) since accession negotiations were started on 3 October 2005. This Accession Partnership is an instrument in the pre-accession strategy.     The legal basis of the Accession Partnership with Croatia is Regulation (EC) No       533/2004      establishing partnerships with countries of the western Balkans. The partnerships are flexible instruments modified according to progress achieved and tasks remaining. The priorities identified are thus defined by the Commission's opinion on the accession request. They are modified, if necessary, on the basis of reports.     The Council of the EU adopts the Accession Partnership, and any subsequent amendments, by a qualified majority on the basis of a proposal from the Commission.      OBJECTIVE      The objective of the partnership for accession is to register in a single legal framework:      the priorities for reform;       guidelines for financial assistance with a view to implementing these priority areas;       the principles and conditions for implementing the Partnership.      In order to achieve the priorities identified in the Accession Partnership, Croatia is adopting a national programme for transposing the Community acquis (NPAA). This includes the procedures and programme for implementing the Partnership.     The follow-up to the Partnership implementation is ensured within the framework of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), notably the Commission's annual follow-up reports.      PRIORITIES      The priorities are both realistic and attainable goals relating to legislation and its implementation. They are based principally on Croatia's ability to comply with:      the         Copenhagen criteria        laid down in 1993;       the conditions set for the stabilisation and association process (Council conclusions of 27 April 1997 and 21 and 22 June 1999);       the         Zagreb declaration        of 2000;       the 2003 Thessaloniki agenda;       the negotiation framework adopted on 3 October 2005.      The Accession Partnership with Croatia includes:       key priorities        , which are short-term priorities. They relate to: commitments made under the SAA; reform of public administration and the judicial system; the fight against corruption; application of the Constitutional Law on National Minorities; completion of the refugee return and integration process; reconciliation among citizens in the region; cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (         ICTY        ); resolution of outstanding bilateral issues, particularly in fields relating to borders and fishing; and improvement in business and economic growth potential;        political criteria        , most importantly democracy and the rule of law (public administration, judicial system, fight against corruption), human rights and the protection of minorities, regional issues and international obligations (protecting the environment and fishing, refugee return, reintegrating returnees, criminal proceedings as regards war crimes, judicial, police and regional cooperation, and border and bilateral issues);        economic criteria        aiming to guarantee macroeconomic stability, budgetary transparency and management of public debt, to improve management of the health sector, the social welfare system and pensions, to facilitate business entry, to improve the institutional framework for privatisation and restructuring of public enterprises, and to strengthen the labour market;        the ability to assume the obligations of membership        , namely adoption and implementation of the         acquis        for 33 of the 35 chapters (thematically arranged by EU legislation policy) to which the accession negotiations apply.      The priorities identified in this Partnership will constitute the basis for future evaluations by the Commission, which regularly evaluates the progress made by Croatia on compliance with the accession criteria, including on the adoption and effective implementation of the       acquis      .      FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK      Croatia has benefited from financial assistance intended to support it in preparing for accession with the pre-accession financial instrument (       IPA      ) for the period 2007-2013. The IPA replaces the instruments       Phare      ,       ISPA      and       SAPARD      and       CARDS      , from which Croatia benefited in the period 2000–2006.     The assistance planned for Croatia under the IPA includes the multiannual indicative financial framework (MIFF link to related MIFF acts) for the period 2009–2011 and the aid planned for Croatia, namely around EUR 749.8 million (including 2007 and 2008). The country is also eligible for funding (including loans and grants) from the European Investment Bank (       EIB      ) under its external lending mandate for the EU's south-eastern neighbours.     In this context, the accession partnership for Croatia serves as a reference framework for determining the different areas to which funds will be allocated. However, the decisions instituting the financial instruments and the programming documents form the legal framework for financial assistance. Failure to comply with the SAA, the Copenhagen criteria and the priorities defined by the Partnership may result in financial assistance being suspended.

   Vulnerable road users and frontal protection systems     Vulnerable road users and frontal protection systems     Technical requirements for the frontal protection systems of motor vehicles are laid down with the aim of improving the protection of pedestrians and other vulnerable road users in the event of a collision with a vehicle equipped with such a system.     ACT     Directive       2005/66/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 relating to the use of frontal protection systems on motor vehicles and amending Council Directive       70/156/EEC      .     SUMMARY     Frontal protection systems or "bull bars", which are increasingly common and present an increased safety risk to pedestrians and other vulnerable road users, must now meet certain technical requirements.     The improvement of the frontal structures of vehicles actually helps to considerably attenuate the severity of injuries to pedestrians and other vulnerable road users, particularly if the vehicle is moving at reduced speed (under 40 km/h) at the time of collision.      Scope      The vehicles covered by the Directive are passenger cars and light commercial vehicles (category M1 and N1 vehicles weighing less than 3.5 tonnes).     The technical requirements of the Directive apply not only to frontal protection systems fitted to a vehicle as original equipment but also to systems supplied as separate technical units.      Technical requirements      The Directive lays down technical requirements for the testing, construction and installation of frontal protection systems. These requirements form part of the Community type-approval procedure established by       Directive 70/156/EEC      .      Timetable      These provisions apply from 25 November 2006 to new types of vehicles as well as to new types of frontal protection systems supplied as separate technical units.     As of 25 May 2007, they will apply to all new vehicles and all frontal protection systems available as separate technical units.     By 25 August 2010 at the latest, the Commission will re-examine these provisions in the light of technical progress and experience gained.      Context      The technical requirements laid down for frontal protection systems are part of the recent focus on the protection of pedestrians and other vulnerable road users, particularly under Directive       2003/102/EC      relating to the protection of pedestrians and other vulnerable road users before and in the event of a collision with a motor vehicle. Road safety measures have thus been extended beyond the protection of only the occupants of vehicles.     The technical requirements laid down for frontal protection systems help to achieve the objective set by the European Commission in its       European Road Safety Action Programme      to halve the number of road accident victims by 2010.

   Goods: statistical returns on the carriage of goods by road     Goods: statistical returns on the carriage of goods by road     This Regulation organises the collection on a comparable basis of statistical data on the carriage of goods on vehicles registered in the European Union with a view to the establishment of an integrated system providing reliable, compatible and up-to-date data.     ACT     Council Regulation (EC) No       1172/98      of 25 May 1998 on statistical returns in respect of carriage of goods by road. [       See amending acts      ].     SUMMARY     The Regulation is intended to supplement the current production of statistical data on the carriage of goods by road.     The Member States are to compile Community statistics on the carriage of goods by road by means of goods road motor vehicles registered in a Member State, and on the journeys made by such vehicles.     The Regulation does not apply to carriage of goods by road by means of:      goods road motor vehicles whose permitted weight or dimensions exceed the normal permitted limits in the Member States concerned.       agricultural vehicles, military vehicles, and vehicles used by central governments and public services, with the exception of goods road motor vehicles used by the railway administration.      The Member States may exclude from the field of application of the proposal goods road motor vehicles:      whose load capacity is less than 3.5 tonnes;or       whose maximum permissible laden weight is less than 6 tonnes.      The Member States are to collect:      vehicle-related data ;       journey-related data ;       goods-related data.      The statistical variables in each domain, their definition and the levels within the classification used for their breakdown are set out in the annexes.     The methods for the collection of data are to ensure that the statistical results meet minimum standards of accuracy determined by the Commission.     Member States are to process the information collected in such a way as to obtain comparable statistics.     Member States are to transmit to Eurostat the data as well as the prepared statistical tables within five months of the end of each quarterly period of observation.     The Member States are to communicate:      a detailed report on the methods used in compiling data;       information on sample sizes, non-response rates, and the reliability of the results;      After three years, the Commission is to transmit a report to the Council and to the European Parliament.     During the first three years of implementation of the statistical returns the Member States are to receive financial assistance from the Community, subject to the availability of appropriations.     The proposal also describes the procedure for:      the dissemination of results ;       determining the arrangements for implementation.      The Statistical Programme Committee assists the Commission.     The Member States give the results for the years 1997 and 1998 to comply with Directive       78/546/EEC      . This was repealed as of 1 January 1999.     Regulation 2691/1999 establishes a new consolidation procedure for international transport by Country.

summary of   Directive 92/66/EEC — EU measures for controlling Newcastle disease   what is the aim of this directive  Newcastle disease is a highly infectious disease in poultry and other birds, particularly affecting egg production, with serious socio-economic consequences. The directive aims to define the response of European Union (EU) countries to suspected and confirmed outbreaks.   key points    The directive applies to  poultry  and other birds in captivity, including  racing pigeons  .   If poultry on a holding is  suspected  of being infected or contaminated with Newcastle disease the relevant authorities should be notified immediately, the holding placed under official surveillance, and the following measures put in place:   the poultry concerned confined without contact with other poultry;   no unauthorised movement of persons, vehicles, other animals, poultry meat, eggs, feed, waste, implements or anything else likely to transmit the disease;   disinfection arrangements at entrances and exits of buildings housing poultry and of the holding itself;   other holdings may be placed under surveillance if there is reason to suspect contamination.     If the disease is  confirmed,  measures put in place will include:   poultry on the holding is to be killed;   contaminated materials must be destroyed or treated;   eggs and meat from poultry slaughtered during the presumed incubation period must be destroyed;   buildings used to house poultry must be cleaned and disinfected;   no poultry must re-enter the holding until at least 21 days after cleaning;   a minimum 3 km  protection zone  , within a 10 km  surveillance zone  , must be set up around the site for at least 21 days, with official checks, clinical examinations and poultry isolated.     EU countries must designate a  national laboratory  to coordinate the response to the disease, working in cooperation with other EU countries and the EU reference laboratory for Newcastle disease, which is situated in the United Kingdom (   1   ).   Approved  vaccination  against the disease can be carried out as well as emergency vaccination in the event of an outbreak.   Each EU country must draw up its own  contingency plan  to respond to the disease, complying with procedures in this directive, including setting up a crisis centre and local disease control centres.  European Commission  experts may make  spot checks  to ensure that these establishments are fully carrying out their responsibilities.   EU countries can claim financial assistance to help in managing Newcastle disease in accordance with Decision  90/424/EEC  .   The  Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed  assists the Commission in managing Newcastle disease.    Repeal   The directive will be repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU)  2016/429  from 21 April 2021.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 29 July 1992. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 1 October 1993.   background   For more information, see:    ‘Newcastle disease’  on the European Commission's website.
   Taking of evidence in civil and commercial matters (until 2022)     Taking of evidence in civil and commercial matters (until 2022)     SUMMARY:      Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 on cooperation between the courts of the EU countries in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters      WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?     It aims to improve and simplify judicial cooperation among       EU      countries and to speed up the taking of evidence in legal proceedings in civil and commercial matters.     Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 is repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU)       2020/1783      (see       summary      ) as of 1 July 2022.     KEY POINTS      Scope      The regulation applies in civil and commercial matters where the court of an EU country:      requests the competent court of another EU country to obtain evidence;       requests permission to gather evidence itself in another EU country.      The request should be made       to obtain evidence      which is intended for use in judicial proceedings, started or considered.      Direct transmission between the courts      EU countries must draw up a list of the courts authorised to obtain evidence and indicate their territorial or special jurisdiction (such as a special court that might have powers to confiscate criminal assets). Requests are directly transmitted by the court before which the proceedings are taking place or are planned (the ‘       requesting court      ’) to the court of the EU country gathering evidence (the ‘       requested court      ’).     Each EU country must designate a       central authority      responsible for:      supplying information to the courts;       seeking solutions to any difficulties regarding transmission;       forwarding, in exceptional cases, a request to the competent court.       Form and content of the request      The request must be lodged using the form specified in this regulation. This form must contain certain details, such as:      the name and address of the parties to the proceedings,       the nature and subject matter of the case,       a description of the taking of evidence to be performed.      Requests must be drafted in the official language of the EU country of the requested court or in any other language which that country indicates it can accept.      Execution      Requests are executed       in accordance with the law of the requested EU country      . The request must be executed within       90 days      of receipt.     The execution of a request may be refused only if:      the request         does not fall within the scope of the regulation        (if, for instance, it concerns criminal and not civil or commercial proceedings);       the execution of the request         does not fall within the functions        of the judiciary;       the request is         incomplete        ;       a person of whom a hearing has been requested claims         a right to refuse, or a prohibition, from giving evidence        ;       a party has not paid the         deposit or advance        relating to the costs of consulting an expert.      Where a request is       refused      , the requested court must notify the requesting court within 60 days of receipt of the request.     If permitted by the law of the country of the requesting court, representatives of the court of that country are entitled to be present when the requested court undertakes the requested act. The parties and their representatives (if any) may also be present.     The regulation does not rule out 2 or more EU countries from concluding or maintaining agreements to speed up or simplify the execution of a request.      Report      In 2007, the       European Commission      published a       report      on the application of the regulation. It concluded that certain measures still needed to be taken in order to improve its functioning. These concerned:      improving the legal professions’ level of knowledge of the regulation;       ensuring the deadline of 90 days set for executing requests is complied with;       making greater use of technologies, specifically videoconferencing.       Public consultation      In December 2017, the Commission launched a       public consultation      on the modernisation of judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters in the EU. The consultation covers both Regulation (EC) No       1393/2007      on the       service of documents      and the regulation covered in this summary.      Repeal      Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 is repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU) 2020/1783 as of 1 July 2022.     FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?     The regulation has applied since 1 January 2004 except for:      Article 19 (concerning the creation by the Commission of a manual of implementing rules),       Article 21 (a list of agreements or arrangements in force between EU countries that they must provide to the Commission) and       Article 22 (information EU countries must provide to the Commission on rules governing the operation of their national courts and competent authorities),      all of which have applied since 1 July 2001.     Denmark is not participating in this regulation.     BACKGROUND     For more information, see:       Taking of evidence in another EU country        (         European Commission        ).

summary of   Directive No 96/53/EC - dimensions and weights of commercial vehicles   summary    what does the directive do        —     It sets out maximum limits for heavy goods vehicles, buses and coaches carrying out international transport within the EU.            —     It requires national transport companies to meet the standards set for international transport.      key points   In  international and national traffic  the directive sets maximum limits on the  dimensions  of:        —     goods vehicles weighing  more than 3.5 tonnes  ;            —     passenger vehicles carrying  more than 9 people  .      In  international traffic  it also fixes maximum limits on the  weight and certain other vehicle characteristics  defined in the directive’s annexes.   What is allowed?         —     In  international transport  , no vehicles that exceed the set limits are allowed to use the roads of an EU country, except with special permits.            —     In  national transport  , no vehicles that exceed the set limits on dimensions are allowed to use the roads of an EU country. However there are several  derogations  to these limits, including for:        —     length of vehicles with aerodynamic features designed to increase energy efficiency;             —     length of vehicles designed to transport particular goods such as timber;             —     weight of vehicles transporting containers in combined transport*.           Vehicles from one EU country which fall within the set limits must be allowed to use the roads of another EU country, with the possible exception of some limited stretches of road like small villages or places of special interest, where lower limits can be set by the administration. EU countries are allowed to have higher limits on weights for national transport inside their territories, and to test new technologies on vehicles that exceed the set limits for a limited time period.   Compliance   EU countries must ensure that vehicles can prove they comply with the rules by providing one of the following:        —     a manufacturer’s plate with an additional plate showing dimensions;            —     a single plate containing both of the above;            —     a document issued by the EU country in which the vehicle was registered containing the same information.       Enforcing the rules   National governments decide how the rules are enforced and what penalties are imposed for exceeding the limits.

summary of   Regulation (EU) 2015/2219 on the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training   what is the aim of this regulation   Purpose   The regulation establishes the  European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL)  , whose aim is to  train law enforcement officials  (police, customs and other relevant services) responsible for:   preventing and fighting  serious crime  ,  terrorism  and forms of crime that affect the  common interest  covered by an EU policy (e.g. fraudulent use of EU funds);    crisis management  and  public order  , in particular the policing of major events.   It replaces and repeals Council Decision  2005/681/JHA  , which originally established the European Police College (CEPOL).   key points    Objectives   With particular emphasis on common respect for, and understanding of,   human rights  and fundamental freedoms  in the context of law enforcement, CEPOL’s main objective is to  support  ,  develop  ,  implement  and  coordinate  the training of law enforcement officials. In particular, it:   supports EU countries in providing training to raise  awareness and knowledge  of:   the implementation and use of international and EU instruments on law enforcement cooperation,   EU bodies such as  the European Police Office  and  Eurojust  , and their operation and role,   police and judicial aspects of law enforcement cooperation and practical knowledge about access to information exchange channels;     supports EU countries, at their request, in developing  regional and bilateral cooperation  through law enforcement training between EU countries, EU bodies and non-EU countries;   has a  network of national training institutes  for law enforcement officials to  support and liaise  with the national unit in each EU country;   develops, implements and coordinates  training on specific criminal or policing subjects  ;   provides training and assists in improving and sharing  best learning practices  .    Tasks   CEPOL’s  main tasks  are:   preparing  multiannual training   needs analyses  and  learning programmes  ;   supporting, developing, implementing and coordinating  training activities  and  learning products  , which include:   exchange and temporary transfer programmes as well as study visits in the context of law enforcement training,   courses, seminars and conferences, as well as web-based, e-learning and other innovative and advanced training activities,   common curricula for law enforcement training on specific subjects with an EU dimension,   training modules graduated according to progressive stages or levels of complexity of the skills needed by the relevant target group, and which are focussed on a specific geographical region, a specific thematic area of criminal activity or a specific set of professional skills;     developing, implementing and coordinating training to support EU countries and EU bodies in training law enforcement officials for participation in  EU missions  and law enforcement  capacity-building activities  in non-EU countries;   promoting the  mutual recognition of law enforcement training  in EU countries;   promoting the recognition by EU countries of the role of training provided at EU level with due regard to the  principle of subsidiarity  .    Structure and location   Based in Budapest, CEPOL is governed by:   a   management board   , made up of representative from each EU country and 1 from the European Commission;   an  executive director  , appointed for 4 years.   Where appropriate, CEPOL can be advised on the scientific aspects of its work by an independent  scientific committee for training  .   Financing   Each year, CEPOL prepares a  budget  which is balanced in terms of expenditure and revenue. The executive director draws up a draft statement of revenue and spending estimates and an establishment plan which is reviewed by the management board.   Work programmes   By 30 November each year, CEPOL adopts a document containing its  multiannual programming  and its   work programme   for the following year.   from when does the regulation apply  It applies from 1 July 2016 except for the aspects governed by Articles 37 (transitional arrangements concerning the management board), 38 (transitional arrangements concerning the executive director and staff) and 39 (transitional budgetary issues), which apply from 24 December 2015.   background   For more information, see:    CEPOL — Who we are  (  CEPOL  ).
   Croatia – Transport     Croatia – Transport     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM(2010) 660      final – SEC(2010) 1326 – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     In its       2010 Report      the Commission presents the progress which must be achieved by Croatia, in particular with regard to air transport and railway safety.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission’s words)      EU       transport      legislation aims at improving the functioning of the Internal Market by promoting efficient and environment- and user-friendly transport services. The transport       acquis      covers the sectors of road transport, railways, aviation, maritime transport and inland waterways. It covers technical and safety standards, social standards, and market liberalisation in the context of the European Single Transport Market.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      Further progress has been achieved in the field of       transport      . Overall, the level of alignment is good. However the completion of the alignment is needed in the aviation sector. Additional efforts are still needed to implement and enforce the       acquis      .     RELATED ACTS      Commission Opinion [         COM(2009) 533        final – SEC(2009) 1333 final – Not published in the Official Journal].       Commission Report [         COM(2008) 674        final – SEC(2008) 2694 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The October 2008 report underlined the advances made by Croatia on the       acquis      . It was considered very important that the country should establish a transport safety authority, an investigative body and a notified body. Moreover, alignment with the       acquis      had to continue in terms of road transport and the establishment of common rules for some types of combined goods transport.      Commission Report [         COM(2007) 663        final - SEC(2007) 1431 - Not published in the Official Journal].      In its November 2007 report, the Commission noted the efforts and progress made in terms of alignment with the       acquis      , particularly in the areas of railway and maritime transport. It emphasised however that it was necessary to strengthen administrative capacity.      Commission Report [         COM(2006) 649        final - SEC(2006) 1385 - Not published in the Official Journal].      In its opinion of November 2006, the Commission judged that Croatia's progress in the transport sector was satisfactory. However, it needed to make increased efforts to align with the       acquis      , notably by further adoption of implementing measures. Croatia also had to increase its administrative capacity, by increasing personnel numbers and improving training.      Commission Report [         COM(2005) 561        final - SEC(2005) 1424 - Not published in the Official Journal].      The November 2005 report noted the progress made by Croatia in aligning transport legislation with the       acquis      . Key framework laws have been adopted in several sectors, notably air and maritime transport. Their effective implementation, however, depends on the adoption of implementing measures and on increasing administrative capacity.      Commission Opinion [         COM(2004) 257        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      In its April 2004 opinion, the Commission encouraged Croatia to continue aligning its transport legislation with the       acquis      . These efforts were particularly necessary concerning safety and the control of State aid in the aviation sector. The transport authorities in general needed reinforcing in order to ensure effective implementation of the reforms.

acts   Directive  2011/96/EU  of the Council of 30 November 2011 on the common system of taxation applicable in the case of parent companies and subsidiaries of different Member States.  Directive  2014/86/EU  of the Council of 8 July 2014 amending Directive 2011/96/EU on the common system of taxation applicable in the case of parent companies and subsidiaries of different Member States.   summary   The objective of this directive, commonly referred to as the parent-subsidiary directive, is to exempt dividends and other profit distributions paid by subsidiary companies to their parent company from withholding taxes, and to eliminate double taxation of such income at the level of the parent company.   Types of companies affected   The types of companies affected are public limited companies, private limited companies, certain cooperatives, mutual companies, savings banks, funds, European companies and European cooperative societies.  These companies must not have their tax domicile outside the EU and must be subject to corporation tax without the possibility of an option and without being exempt.  The status of parent company is attributed to a company from an EU country that has a minimum holding of 10 % in the capital of a company from another EU country.   Receiving profits   A parent company or a permanent establishment has the possibility of  receiving profits  , even outside of the liquidation period. In this case, the EU country of the parent company or of the permanent establishment shall refrain from taxing these profits or shall tax them while authorising the parent company and the permanent establishment to deduct from the amount of tax due that fraction of the corporation tax related to those profits and paid by the subsidiary and any lower-tier subsidiary.  In an effort to prevent cross-border companies from scheduling their payments within the group in order to benefit from  double non-taxation  , the EU country of the parent company or of the permanent establishment must tax the profits received, insofar as these profits are deductible by the subsidiary.  EU countries retain the option of providing that any  charges  relating to the holding and any  losses in capital  resulting from the distribution of the profits of the subsidiary may not be deducted from the taxable profits of the parent company.  The profits distributed by a subsidiary to its parent company are exempt from withholding tax. Similarly, the EU country of the parent company may not charge withholding tax on the profits that this company receives from its subsidiary. However, this provision does not concern the  advance payment  or the  prepayment of corporation tax  to the EU country in which the subsidiary is located, made in connection with a distribution of profits to the parent company.

   Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan)     Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan)     The Commission presents a strategic plan to accelerate the development and deployment of cost-effective low carbon technologies. This plan comprises measures relating to planning, implementation, resources and international cooperation in the field of energy technology.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 22 November 2007 entitled: "A European strategic energy technology plan (SET Plan) - Towards a low carbon future" [       COM(2007) 723      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Energy technology is vital if Europe's objectives for 2020 and 2050 as regards the fight against climate change, security of energy supply and competitiveness of European companies are to be fulfilled.     However, certain constraints hamper the development and widespread application of energy technologies, be they the chronic underinvestment that has affected this sector since the 1980s, significant delays in the marketing of new products, the additional cost often involved without always giving better energy output, legal and administrative obstacle, or their social acceptability.     In addition, faced with competition from certain industrialised countries and emergent economies, the European Union (EU) Member States must adopt an effective joint approach on the subject of energy technologies. The timing of the adoption of such an approach will also determine whether European objectives are met.     The strategic energy technology plan (SET plan) presented by the Commission aims to help achieve European objectives and face up to the challenges of this sector:      in the short term by increasing research to reduce costs and improve performance of existing technologies, and by encouraging the commercial implementation of these technologies. Activities at this level should in particular involve second-generation biofuels, capture, transport and storage of carbon, integration of renewable energy sources into the electricity network and energy efficiency in construction, transport and industry;       in the longer term by supporting development of a new generation of low carbon technologies. The activities to be carried out should focus, among other things, on the competitiveness of new technologies relating to renewable energies, energy storage, sustainability of fission energy, fusion energy, and the development of Trans-European Energy networks.      Implementation of this SET plan will involve collective effort and activities in the private sector, the Member States and the EU, as well as internationally.     The SET plan first of all proposes a new governance method for energy technologies, based on joint strategic planning.     With this in mind, a steering group, created by the Commission in 2008 and made up of representatives of the Member States, will improve coherence by developing joint actions, making resources available and evaluating progress. Also, a European summit on energy technologies is planned for 2009. Furthermore, the Commission will set up a European information system, comprising technology mapping and capacity mapping.     The SET plan also improves the effectiveness of the implementation of the jointly decided actions, so as to take full advantage of the possibilities offered by the European research area and the internal market.     The Commission will therefore gradually launch new European industrial initiatives, in wind energy, solar energy, bio-energy, capture, transport and storage of CO², the electricity network and nuclear fission, which will take the form of public-private partnerships or joint programmes between Member States. Furthermore, the Commission wants to create a European energy research alliance to better coordinate, in terms of programming, the efforts of research centres and universities. A prospective approach will also be adopted to prepare the future development of Trans-European energy networks and systems.     An increase in resources, both financial and human, is another major element of the SET plan. Investment in research and innovation must increase at Community level, through the       research framework programme      of the "Intelligent Energy - Europe" programme and the European Investment Bank, as well as in the Member States, in order to double the overall effort made in the EU within three years. A communication from the Commission will be issued in 2008 on the subject of funding of low carbon technologies. In addition, the training of energy researchers will be promoted and new research and training opportunities will be created, to increase the number and quality of engineers and researchers.     Finally, the SET plan makes provision for intensified international cooperation, in order to promote the development, marketing, deployment and accessibility of low carbon technologies worldwide. The EU should speak more often with one voice on this matter. Cooperation with developed countries will involve public interest research and long-term exploratory research. As for developing countries and emergent economies, cooperation should allow their sustainable development while creating opportunities for European companies; cooperation could be involved, for example, in networking of research centres, large-scale demonstration projects and increased use of the mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol.

   European initiative on electronic commerce     European initiative on electronic commerce     The principal aim of this communication is to encourage the vigorous growth of electronic commerce in Europe.     ACT     Commission communication of 18 April 1997: A European Initiative in the sector of Electronic Commerce [       COM(97) 157      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY      Definition and background      Electronic commerce, based on the electronic processing and transmission of data, encompasses many diverse activities including electronic trading of goods and services, on-line delivery of digital content, electronic funds transfers, electronic share trading, public procurement, and so on.     These activities may be divided into two categories:      indirect electronic commerce, i.e. the electronic ordering of tangible goods that must still be physically delivered and which therefore depends on a number of external factors, such as the efficiency of the transport system and postal services; and       direct electronic commerce, i.e. the on-line ordering, payment and delivery of intangible goods and services such as computer software and entertainment content.      Electronic commerce is not limited to the Internet, but includes other applications such as videotex, tele-shopping and catalogue sales on CD-Rom.     The Commission's communication looks at electronic commerce in the international context. It compares Europe's strengths with American advances in the field and stresses that any action on electronic commerce has to be compatible with WTO commitments. It also raises the problem of cyber-crime, which must be tackled urgently in order to reinforce trust and confidence in transnational electronic commerce.      Ensuring access to the global marketplace: infrastructure, technology and services      Effective telecommunications liberalisation in the European Union from 1 January 1998 should lead to lower prices in general and the introduction of more flexible tariff schemes for businesses. As a result, Internet use should increase, as should the take-up of electronic commerce.     The WTO Agreement on Basic Telecommunications, which contains commitments from 69 countries on market access and national treatment, will contribute significantly to the emergence of a global marketplace when it comes into force on 1 January 1998.     The take-up of electronic commerce will also be stimulated by the gradual elimination (by the year 2000) of tariff and non-tariff barriers on information technology products (computers, software, etc.), which will also have the effect of bringing down the costs of these basic tools.     In order to deal with the bottlenecks caused by the growing use of infrastructure, the Commission recommends a coordinated approach through the R&D programmes in information and communications technologies. These programmes also support innovation, privacy-enhancing technologies and user-friendly access to information.     Interoperability between various electronic commerce services must be ensured, in particular by involving European industry and users in standardisation work within the European standards bodies (CEN, CENELEC et ETSI).     The Commission encourages international industrial cooperation in the field of technology, infrastructure and services.      Creating a favourable regulatory framework      Two things are needed for electronic commerce to develop successfully:      building trust and confidence, the prerequisite to win over business and consumers to electronic commerce;       ensuring full access to the single market, by making sure that Member States do not adopt divergent legislation and establishing a coherent regulatory framework at European level.      To achieve these objectives, a regulatory framework must be established based on the following principles:      no regulation where the free movement of electronic commerce services can be effectively achieved by mutual recognition of national rules and of appropriate self-regulatory codes;       any regulation must be based on all single market freedoms;       any regulation must take account of business realities;       any regulation must meet general interest objectives (privacy, consumer protection, wide accessibility to the networks) effectively and efficiently.      To ensure that electronic commerce freely flows across national frontiers, different legal issues still need to be addressed. Which Member State will be competent and which law applicable in disputed cases? Which laws are applicable in the field of commercial communications (advertising, direct marketing, etc.)? Legal recognition of electronic contracts, adapting of accounting and audit rules and the soundness of electronic payment systems are also unresolved matters which must be addressed.     The regulatory framework must:      ensure data security and privacy through the use of encryption;       establish appropriate protection for intellectual property rights and conditional access services;       ensure a clear and neutral tax environment.       Promoting a favourable business environment      A favourable business environment will depend on:      creating awareness and confidence among consumers by encouraging the use of quality labels and codes of conduct and by increasing the transparency of transactions;       creating awareness among businesses and encouraging them to make use of electronic commerce themselves;       encouraging public administrations to take a more pro-active line, particularly in the areas of customs and taxes, employment services and public procurement, in order to introduce electronic commerce in business-public administration relationships;       putting electronic commerce at the service of the citizen, in particular by teaching new skills, to avoid the risk of creating a split society of users and non-users.      To implement this initiative, the Commission has drawn up a timetable of actions to be completed by the year 2000. These concern telecommunications, with a view to achieving effective liberalisation of the sector. They also seek to promote electronic commerce awareness among businesses, public bodies and the general public, which will be the main priority of the Fifth R&D Framework Programme. The Commission is also looking into standardisation projects and considering the legislation which will be necessary to remove legal uncertainties.     Last updated: 12.05.2006  
   Iceland – Health and consumers     Iceland – Health and consumers     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM(2011) 666      final – SEC(2011) 1202 final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     Although Iceland’s level of alignment is satisfactory, the       2011 Report      highlights the progress still required on consumer policy. The country is a member of the       European Economic Area      (EEA).      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission’s words)      The       acquis      in this area covers protection of the       economic interests of consumers      in a number of specific sectors (misleading and comparative advertising, price indication, consumer credit, unfair contract terms, distance and doorstep selling, package travel, timeshare, injunctions for the protection of consumers' interests, certain aspects of the sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees), as well as       general safety of consumer goods      (liability for defective products, dangerous imitations and general safety of goods) and distance marketing of consumer financial services. The Member States of the European Union (EU) must transpose the       acquis      into their national law, and establish administrative structures and independent implementation bodies which ensure real market surveillance and effective application of the       acquis      . They must also provide appropriate judicial and out-of-court dispute resolution mechanisms. Furthermore, they must ensure that consumers are informed and educated and that consumer organisations play an active role. This chapter also covers certain binding rules with regard to       public health      .      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      Iceland has already achieved a good level of alignment and implementation of the       acquis      in the fields of       consumer protection      and       health      . However, additional effort is required in order to achieve full alignment, particularly concerning consumer protection. More active participation in the RAPEX system is essential.

   VAT: Special scheme applicable to travel agencies     VAT: Special scheme applicable to travel agencies     This directive aims to simplify and amend the VAT rules applicable to travel agencies selling travel packages within the European Union, in order to put these agencies on an equal footing, promote more uniform application of the special VAT scheme and eliminate distortions of competition, especially in relation to third country operators.     PROPOSAL      Proposal for a Council Directive of 8 February 2002 amending Directive         77/388/EEC        as regards the special VAT scheme for travel agencies      When the       6th VAT Directive      was adopted in 1977 a special scheme was introduced for travel agencies and tour operators. This special VAT scheme, set out in Article 26 of the 6th VAT Directive (Directive       77/388/EEC)      , was brought in due to the special nature of the industry. The services offered by travel agencies and tour operators usually consist of a package of services, in particular, transport and accommodation obtained from third parties. These packages are then sold by travel agencies, in their own names, to travellers. Under these circumstances, the normal rules on the taxable amount, deduction of input tax and place of taxation are particularly difficult to apply due to the complexity and location of the services provided.      The special tax system as now applied      Under Article 26 of the 6th VAT Directive, all transactions performed by the travel agency in respect of a journey are regarded as a single supply. The taxable amount is the profit margin realised by the agency on the supply of a travel package and hence the agency is not entitled to deduct input VAT on transactions directly benefiting the traveller. The place of taxation for the agent's supply is where he has established his business activities or has a fixed base from which he provides the service or, failing this, the place where he has his permanent address or usually resides.     Hence this special VAT scheme has two aims: (a) to simplify application of Community VAT rules for these supplies, particularly so that a travel agency avoids multiple registration for VAT purposes in each Member State where the services are provided; (b) to ensure that the VAT revenue goes to the Member State in which final consumption of each individual service takes place (NB VAT revenue on services enjoyed in the course of the journey, such as hotels, restaurants or transport, will go to the Member State in which the traveller receives the service, whereas VAT on travel agencies' margins returns to the Member State where the agency is established).     On the basis of case law from the European Court of Justice, the Commission considers that the margin-based system is only applicable when the package is sold to the traveller (the final consumer). If the package is sold by one tour operator or a travel agency to another, the margin scheme is not applicable and each transaction must be taxed separately in accordance with the relevant criteria determining the place of supply.     Certain Member States apply this system differently, however, even going so far as to uphold another interpretation of Article 26 whereby the margin scheme should also apply where a package is sold by one tour operator or travel agency to another.     Similarly, some Member States grant an exemption on the sale of package tours, while others apply an all-in method for calculating the travel agency's profit margin.      Problems encountered      In practice the special VAT scheme for travel agencies is not applied uniformly by Member States. As the interpretation of Article 26 varies widely from one Member State to the next, the margin scheme is applied in a very divergent way, which sometimes leads to double taxation, distortions of competition and unfair distribution of VAT receipts among Member States.      Proposed solution: amendment of Article 26      In view of the above problems and the basic aims of this special scheme (cf. point 3), the Commission proposes amending Article 26 while still preserving the logic of this Article. It thereby aims to simplify and update Community legislation relating to VAT and promote more uniform and hence fairer application of the rules.      More uniform application of the margin scheme      The Commission proposes broadening the scope of application of the special scheme applying to travel agencies so as to allow them to apply VAT to their profit margin for services sold to other travel agencies as well as to private individuals.     This proposal would also make it no longer possible for Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands to exempt tour operators from VAT. It would also abolish the all-in method of margin calculation as now applied in Belgium.      Inclusion of tour operators not established in the European Union within the scope of the VAT system      With the growing use of the Internet as a sales outlet, package tour agencies or tour operators established in third countries are increasingly providing package tours to EU residents. This situation causes a clear distortion of competition since at present package tours in the EU are taxed under the margin scheme when supplied by an operator established in the EU yet are not taxable when supplied by an operator established in a third country. Under these circumstances, the Commission proposes that tour operators established outside the EU should also be VAT registered when selling package tours to those established in the EU and that they pay the tax in the EU Member State where the customer is established. In order to simplify the obligations of suppliers not established in the EU and avoid their registration for VAT purposes in all Member States where they have clients, the Commission proposes use of the "one stop shop" scheme introduced in the       special VAT scheme applicable to certain electronically supplied services      (see point 12).      Optional provision in respect of sales to other commercial operators      In the present situation, when a customer, such as a firm, orders a package tour from a travel agent for business purposes, he is not entitled to deduct the VAT comprised in the cost of the package tour, even though normally he would be able to do so for services provided to him for business purposes. It follows that it is in the best interest of firms to deal with individual suppliers of the items of a package tour, subject to normal VAT rules, rather than dealing with a travel agency, so as to be able to deduct VAT. To avoid this problem, the Commission proposes entitling travel agencies to opt for application of the normal VAT system rather than the margin scheme if they choose to do so. This would entitle the taxable client to deduct the remaining VAT invoiced to him by the travel agency.     The proposal also introduces a simplification of the definition of "profit margin" in order to put an end to the difficulties experienced by several Member States in calculating the profit margin under the special system applicable to travel agencies.     In order to simplify the profit margin system, the Commission also proposes authorising travel agencies to calculate a single profit margin for package tours provided over a certain period, so that they need not determine this margin for every package tour they sell.     To this end, on 21 February 2003 the Commission adopted a proposal for a Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament amending Regulation (EEC) No       218/92      on administrative cooperation in the field of indirect taxation (VAT) as regards additional measures regarding supplies of travel services [       COM(2003) 78      /2 - Not published in the Official Journal]. This proposal aims to include in the special margin scheme applicable to travel agencies the simplified mechanism adopted for services provided electronically by suppliers not established in the European Union to customers established in the EU. On 2 September 2003 the European Parliament approved the Commission proposal without amendment, at first reading.

act   Communication of 7 July 2004 from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee on Developing countries, international trade and sustainable development: the function of the Community's generalised system of preferences (GSP) for the ten-year period from 2006 to 2015 [  COM(2004) 461  final - Official Journal C 242 of 29.9.2004]   summary   In this Communication the European Commission proposes guidelines for the generalised system of preferences for the period 2006-2015, based on experience of earlier systems. It advocates:   Maintaining generous tariff rates   There are a number of ways of maintaining and even improving the tariff preferences. Among other things the Commission proposes extending the GSP to some products not covered by the current system, under which almost one tenth of taxable products in the Customs Tariff are not covered.  Some products classed as sensitive could also be transferred to the category of non-sensitive products.  Preferential margins (currently 3.5 % for sensitive products and 100 % for non-sensitive products) will be maintained and, where possible, increased.  The enlargement of the European Union (EU) by ten new Member States in 2004 and the subsequent enlargements to include Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia helped to improve what the Community can offer since it expanded the EU market to include a further 100 million potential consumers.   Targeting the GSP on the countries that most need it   The Commission proposes that the GSP should target the countries that need it most, such as the least developed countries (LDCs) and the most vulnerable among the other developing countries (small economies, land-locked countries and low-revenue countries) to help them to play a greater part in international trade.  The GSP should also have a mechanism for gradual withdrawal of a country from the special GSP, the everything-but-arms scheme, which gives duty-free and quota-free access to all products (except arms and munitions) from the fifty poorest countries.   A simpler GSP with easier access   The process of simplification, already started under the present GSP, should be enhanced. The Commission has proposed replacing the five GSP arrangements to three: the general arrangement, the special arrangement for the least developed countries and a new special arrangement (GSP+) to encourage sustainable development and good governance.   Making graduation more transparent and targeting it on the prime beneficiaries   The Commission proposes making graduation (withdrawal from the GSP) more transparent by withdrawing the most competitive product groups of certain beneficiary countries from the GSP.  This means that the beneficiaries no longer need the GSP to increase their exports of those products to the EU. The smaller beneficiaries will not be graduated and so can enjoy a greater share of the benefits of the GSP.  The current criteria for graduation (share of preferential imports, development index and export-specialisation index) will be replaced with a single straightforward criterion: share of the Community market, expressed as a share of preferential imports.   Devising a new incentive to encourage sustainable development and governance   As already mentioned, the Commission proposes introducing a new incentive for sustainable development and good management of public affairs by replacing the separate drugs, social and environment special arrangements with a single new category: GSP+.  GSP+ will provide special incentives for countries which have signed up to the main international agreements on social rights, environmental protection, governance and combating the production of and trafficking in illegal drugs.  The Commission will take account of the evaluations by the international organisations responsible for each international agreement concerned before deciding which of the applicant countries will be selected to benefit from the GSP+. This scheme will include a credible suspension clause that can be rapidly activated where a country fails to meet its commitments under the agreements.   Improving the rules of origin   The Commission proposes improving the rules of origin by changing their form (simplifying them), their substance (adjusting the origin criteria and cumulation rules) and their procedures (formalities and controls).  The new rules of origin should also be flexible in order to encourage development. One of the objectives must be to facilitate acquisition of origin to optimise the benefits of preferences.  The system could, for example, be improved by regional cumulation, promoting regional cooperation among beneficiary countries. The Commission attaches particular importance to regional integration for southern countries as a route to greater involvement of the southern countries in international trade.   Restoring the temporary withdrawal instruments, safeguard measures and anti-fraud measures   The Commission proposes redefining the GSP temporary withdrawal arrangements and the safeguard clause to take account of the new graduation focused on the most competitive beneficiary countries.  Even though they will still be for use in exceptional circumstances only, those arrangements must be made more credible, which will involve simplifying them and making the way they are used more flexible, particularly in cases of unfair trade practices. It is also essential that the Commission and Member States responsible for applying the GSP should apply these rules unwaveringly where fraud is detected.  As the beneficiary countries also have GSP management responsibilities, the Commission calls on them to establish effective and appropriate management structures to guarantee the validity of certificates or origin.   Background   The generalised system of preferences allows manufactured products and some agricultural products exported by developing countries access to the Community market with total or partial exemption from customs duties.  It is thus an instrument of both the European Community's trade policy and its development policy. As it is a cooperation instrument it is a provisional mechanism, the benefits of which are to be withdrawn from countries that no longer need it.  The EU absorbs one-fifth of developing countries' exports. 40 % of EU imports come from the developing countries. The EU is also the world's biggest importer of agricultural products from developing countries, importing more than the United States, Canada and Japan put together.
summary of   European Commission communication (COM(2016) 87 final) — EU Action Plan against Wildlife Trafficking   summary    what does this communication do   It sets out a  blueprint  to fight against wildlife trafficking (i.e. the illegal gathering, transportation and distribution of animals and their derivatives) both in the EU and at global level.   It seeks to mobilise  all the EU’s diplomatic, trade and development cooperation channels  to bring a stop to what is now one of the most profitable criminal activities worldwide.   key points   The action plan comprises  32 measures  to be carried out between 2016 and 2020 by the EU, which will be carried out by each of the 28 EU countries (   1   ). It focuses on 3 key aspects:    1.     Preventing trafficking and reducing supply and demand of illegal wildlife products  . For example:    the  European Commission  is to  issue guidelines  aiming to suspend the export of old ivory items from the EU. EU countries, in turn, will only issue intra-EU trade certificates for ancient ivory items on the basis of the criteria defined in the guidelines;   the Commission and the  High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy  will ensure that  references to wildlife trafficking  are included in EU policy and tools against corruption (in particular as part of dialogues with key non-EU countries that receive EU budgetary support).        2.     Better implementation of existing rules and combating organised crime more effectively  . For example:    the Commission,  Europol  and  Eurojust  will seek to  improve cooperation  among EU countries on cases of cross-border wildlife trafficking;   the Commission, the High Representative and EU countries will support  capacity building  for law enforcement in key source and market countries, including enforcement within protected sites.        3.     Strengthening cooperation between source, destination and transit countries  . For example:    the Commission and the High Representative will seek to provide increased, more effective and  more strategically focused support  to developing countries to tackle trafficking;   along with EU countries, the Commission and the High Representative will  step up dialogue  with key source, transit and market countries, including with local rural communities,  civil society  and the private sector.      background   Wildlife trafficking is one of the most profitable criminal activities worldwide. It has serious effects on biodiversity and a negative impact on the  rule of law  due to its close links with corruption. It plays an increasing role in financing militia and terrorist groups.  The EU is a destination, source and a transit region for wildlife trafficking. On all these counts, it has a pivotal role to play in eradicating this illegal trade.  For more information, see  ‘The EU Approach to Combat Wildlife Trafficking’  on the European Commission’s website.   act   Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions — EU Action Plan against Wildlife Trafficking (  COM(2016) 87 final  of 26.2.2016)
summary of   Regulation (EU) 2017/2400 implementing Regulation (EC) No 595/2009 — determination of the CO2 emissions and fuel consumption of heavy-duty vehicles   what is the aim of the regulation   It establishes a common method to objectively compare accurate details of CO  2  emissions and fuel consumption of new heavy-duty vehicles (lorries, buses and coaches) on sale in the EU.   It does so by setting out the responsibilities of motor vehicle manufacturers and national authorities. They must certify the CO  2  emissions and fuel consumption of vehicle components such as the engine, gearbox, axles and tyres, which are used as input data to a  simulation tool   *  to determine the CO  2  emissions and fuel consumption of the vehicle.   The information is designed to encourage the development of more energy-efficient vehicles.   It implements Regulation (EC) No 595/2009 on  type-approval with regard to emissions from heavy-duty vehicles (Euro VI)  .   key points   The regulation:   applies to lorries with a maximum weight of more than 7.5 tonnes;   does not apply to buses, off-road or special purpose vehicles.   The  European Commission  provides for free, and updates, a downloadable software programme for the simulation tool to determine the CO  2  emissions and fuel consumption of heavy-duty vehicles.   Vehicle manufacturers  must:   apply for a licence to operate the simulation tool;   inform the national authority issuing the licence of any changes they make to the processes for determining the CO2 emissions and fuel consumption of the vehicle;   use the most up-to-date version of the simulation tool (at the latest within 3 months of its availability) to determine the CO  2  emissions and fuel consumption of every new vehicle sold, registered or put into service in the EU;   ensure the results of the simulation tool respect the processes laid down and include these in the vehicle’s customer information file;   store records of the results of the simulation tool for at least 20 years after the vehicle is produced and make these available to national authorities or the Commission within 15 days of a request.   Annexes set out the  technical procedures  for determining the CO  2  emissions and fuel consumption of components to be input into the simulation tool.   National authorities  :   certify the CO  2  emissions and fuel consumption values of components submitted by the component manufacturer if they are satisfied all the requirements have been complied with;   grant a licence to the vehicle manufacturer to operate the simulation tool;   assess 4 times a year whether the manufacturer’s processes for determining the CO  2  emissions and fuel consumption continue to respect the legislation;   instruct manufacturers to correct within 30 days any defects in their processes for determining the CO  2  emissions and fuel consumption.   from when does the regulation apply  Overall, it has applied since 18 January 2018. The CO  2  emissions and fuel consumption of new heavy-duty vehicles must be determined since 1 January 2019.   background    Emissions from lorries and buses, the most common types of heavy-duty vehicles, account for 25% of road transport CO  2  emissions. They are expected to increase even further.   Effective measures are needed to reach the EU target of a 60% cut in CO  2  transport emissions by 2050.   Previously, no common EU-wide method existed to determine the vehicles’ CO  2  emissions and fuel consumption, making objective comparisons of their performance impossible and preventing efforts to introduce national or EU measures to encourage more energy-efficient vehicles.   For more information, see:    Reducing CO2 emissions from heavy-duty vehicles  (  European Commission  ).     key terms    Simulation tool:  an electronic tool for the calculation of CO  2  emissions and fuel consumption of new heavy-duty vehicles, based on certified input data for the CO  2  emissions and fuel consumption of their components.
summary of   Directive 2009/54/EC — exploitation and marketing of natural mineral waters   summary    what does this directive do  It harmonises the conditions under which natural mineral waters may be sold in the EU and ensures these are safe for human consumption.   key points    National authorities must ensure the water complies with the EU legislation before they award it natural mineral water status. Each EU country informs the  European Commission  when this recognition is granted or withdrawn.   Natural mineral water imported into the EU must be certified and satisfy the same criteria as domestic competitors.   Natural mineral water may not undergo any treatment apart, for instance, from the separation of unstable elements such as iron and sulphur compounds.   At source, and when on sale, natural mineral waters must be free from parasites, various coliforms (types of bacteria) and other ingredients dangerous to human health.   Containers for natural mineral waters must be properly sealed to avoid any possible contamination.   Natural mineral waters may be sold, where appropriate, according to the following definitions:   natural mineral water   carbonated* natural mineral water   naturally carbonated* natural mineral water   natural mineral water fortified with gas from the spring.     Labels must also give the following information:   details of the water’s analytical composition   the name and place of the spring used   information on any treatment the water has undergone.     It is illegal to use more than one trade description to market natural mineral water from the same spring.   It is illegal to claim that the water has characteristics it does not possess.   The term ‘spring water’ can only be used for water intended for human consumption in its natural state, bottled at source and meets the legislation's health and labelling conditions.   A national authority which considers that a natural mineral water could be a danger to human health may restrict or ban its sale. It informs other EU countries and the Commission.   The legislation does not apply to waters considered to be medicinal products or to natural mineral waters used as cures in thermal and hydrothermal spas.   from when does the directive apply  It applies from 16 July 2009.   background   For more information, see  ‘Natural Mineral Waters and Spring Water’  on the European Commission’s website.   key terms    * carbonated natural mineral water  : water to which has been added carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) of an origin other than the water table or deposit from which the water comes.   * naturally carbonated natural mineral water  : water the CO  2  content of which from the spring after decanting, if any, and bottling is the same as at source. This takes into account, where appropriate, the reintroduction of a quantity of CO  2  from the same water table or deposit equivalent to that released in the course of those operations.   act   Directive  2009/54/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2009 on the exploitation and marketing of natural mineral waters (Recast) (OJ L 164, 26.6.2009, pp. 45-58)
   Education and training in the nuclear energy field     Education and training in the nuclear energy field     Nuclear energy is currently the subject of debate on the national and international stage, following the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in March 2011. It appears essential to have experienced staff who are able to use nuclear energy responsibly and to conduct nuclear waste management and the decommissioning of power plants. This Communication therefore proposes a number of training avenues designed to strengthen the competence of staff in this sector, and to ensure that no nuclear accidents such as that at Fukushima occur in future.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council of 16 September 2011 – 1st situation report on education and training in the nuclear energy field in the European Union [       COM(2011) 563      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     This Communication reports on the current situation with regard to staff training in the nuclear sector. It proposes several avenues in order to ensure that the European Union (EU) has a sufficient number of well-trained staff to use nuclear energy responsibly.      Present situation in the nuclear sector as to human resources      In 2008, the European Commission launched and published a study entitled       Nuclear Safety in a Situation of Fading Nuclear Experience      with the aim of analysing the availability of nuclear safety staff. This study revealed a situation of concern for the period to 2020, which may be explained by the following facts:      the number of students and graduates with a strong background in nuclear sciences is insufficient;       the nuclear sector does not attract university graduates;       continuing education for nuclear sector staff is not ensured.      The study has demonstrated the need for:      a regular supply and demand analysis at EU level concerning the qualitative and quantitative needs for new staff;       continuous monitoring of the challenges identified.       Proposed initiatives      It appears necessary for the Commission to       enhance university studies in nuclear sciences and techniques      . The European Nuclear Education Network (ENEN) Association, created in 2003, has a role to play. Composed of 60 universities, it endeavours to ensure the free movement of nuclear knowledge.     The Commission also wishes to introduce       incentives      for graduates to take up jobs in the nuclear sector. In January 2010, the       European Nuclear Energy Leadership Academy      (ENELA) was established by the following European companies:       AREVA        ;        Axpo        ;        EnBW        ;        E.ON Kernkraft        ;        URENCO        ;        Vattenfal        .      The purpose of the ENELA is to provide young science graduates, or managers with experience, with the skills and expertise they will need to become future leaders in the field of nuclear energy.     It is also vital to develop       post-graduate and professional training      , and to improve expertise and mobility. This Communication identifies three types of initiative aimed at achieving this target:       EU initiatives        : the Commission wishes to create "European Skill Passports" to integrate the requirements of mobility and lifelong learning. In the nuclear sector as well, it is appropriate to use the         European Credit system for Vocational Education and Training        (ECVET), and the Euratom or ENEN training programmes. The         Instrument for Nuclear Safety Cooperation        (ICSN) can also help to increase the technical knowledge and capabilities of non-EU countries, as can the Sustainable Nuclear Energy Technology Platform (         SNE-TP        ).        International initiatives:        The ENEN is a member of the         World Nuclear University        (WNU), whose purpose is to enhance education and leadership in nuclear science and technology. In addition, the International Atomic Energy Agency (         IAEA        ) is highly active in disseminating information in the nuclear field. It supports the International School of Nuclear Law, established in 2001 by the         OECD/NEA        , which offers an intensive course in international nuclear law.        National initiatives:        a number of Member States (including Belgium, Denmark, France and Romania) have established national nuclear education networks and post-graduate programmes.      Since 2009, the European Human Resource Observatory in the Nuclear Energy Sector (EHRO-N) has monitored the situation and provided human resources data.

summary of   Directive 2000/9/EC — Cableway installations designed to carry persons   what is the aim of the directive  It defines a set of essential safety requirements at European Union (EU) level as well as inspection and control procedures to be applied to cableways that carry passengers.   key points   Cableways carrying passengers are capital goods (i.e. heavy equipment requiring relatively large investment). They comprise several components and are designed, manufactured, assembled and commissioned in order to be able to provide a passenger-carrying service.   Scope    The installations concerned by this directive are:   funicular railways or other vehicles where traction is provided by one or more cables;   cable cars lifted and/or displaced by carrier cables, including gondolas and chair lifts;   drag lifts.     The directive does not apply to:   lifts within the meaning of Directive  95/16/EC  ;   cable-operated tramways of traditional construction;   installations used for agricultural purposes;   equipment designed for leisure purposes for use in fairgrounds or amusement parks;   installations for mining and industrial purposes;   cable-operated ferries, rack railways and chain-driven installations.    Definitions    The directive gives definitions for  installation   *  ,  safety component   *  ,  main contractor   *  ,  operability   *  and  maintainability   *  .   It determines the objectives or  essential requirements  as regards safety, health and protection of both the environment and consumers that the equipment must meet during its manufacture and before being placed in service.    Standardisation    European  specifications  (common technical specifications, European technical approvals or national standards transposing European standards) are drawn up on the basis of essential requirements. They are published in the  Official Journal of the European Union  .   European harmonised standards are drawn up by  European standardisation organisations  .   Any system that has been produced in compliance with the European specifications is presumed to meet the essential requirements.    Assessment procedures    The procedures for assessing the compliance of safety components and systems with the essential requirements are based on the modular approach set out in EU rules on  CE conformity marking  . The assessment of their compliance is a responsibility of the organisations designated by EU countries, in accordance with common assessment criteria, that then notify the  European Commission  and the other EU countries. The assessment procedure is initiated at the request of either the manufacturer or their representative within the EU in the case of safety components, or the main customer or their representative in the case of installations.   Before being placed on the market the equipment must have received the CE declaration of conformity, which adds practical form to their compliance with this directive. This is drawn up by either the manufacturer or their representative within the EU in the case of safety components, or the main customer or their representative in the case of installations.   Where the safety components are covered by other EU directives, the CE declaration of conformity also states that the safety components meet the requirements of those directives.   EU countries may not, on their territory and on the basis of this directive, prohibit, restrict or hamper:   the placing on the market of safety components in order to use these in a system;   the building and placing in service of installations, which meet the requirements set out in the existing directive.     An EU country should ascertain whether a safety component bearing the CE conformity marking or an installation authorised and used in accordance with its intended purpose is liable to endanger the safety and health of persons and, where applicable, the safety of property. If the EU country finds that it does, it must take all appropriate measures to restrict the conditions of use of the component or of the installation. The directive sets out the procedures to be followed depending on whether non-conformity is due to:   failure to satisfy the essential requirements;   incorrect application of the European specifications;   shortcomings in the European specifications.      Repeal   Directive 2000/9/EC is repealed and replaced by  Regulation (EU) 2016/424  with effect from 21 April 2018.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 3 May 2000.

summary of   Directive (EU) 2016/1164 — preventing tax avoidance by companies   what is the aim of the directive  It introduces rules to prevent tax avoidance by companies and thus to address the issue of aggressive tax planning in the EU’s single market.   key points    Scope   The directive applies to all taxpayers that are subject to company tax in one or more EU country, including permanent establishments in one or more EU countries of entities resident for tax purposes in a non-EU country.   Combating base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS)   *   The directive lays down anti-tax-avoidance rules in 4 specific fields to combat BEPS:    Interest limitation rules:  where multinational companies artificially erode their tax base by paying inflated interest payments to affiliated companies in low-tax jurisdictions. The directive aims to dissuade companies from this practice by limiting the amount of interest that a taxpayer has the right to deduct in a tax period. The maximum amount of deductible interest is set at a maximum of 30% of the taxpayer’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation (a measure of how much of an asset's value has been used up at a given point in time) and amortisation (spreading payments over multiple periods).    Exit taxation rules:  where taxpayers try to reduce their tax liability by transferring its tax residence and/or its assets to a low-tax jurisdiction, solely for the purposes for aggressive tax planning. Exit taxation rules aims to prevent the erosion of the tax base in the EU country of origin when high-value assets are transferred with ownership unchanged, outside the tax jurisdiction of that country. The directive gives taxpayers the option of deferring the payment of the amount of tax over 5 years and settling through staggered payments, but only if the transfer takes place within the EU.    General anti-abuse rule:  this rule aims to cover gaps that may exist in a country's specific anti-abuse rules against tax avoidance, and allows tax authorities the power to deny taxpayers the benefit of abusive tax arrangements. The general anti-abuse clause of the directive applies to arrangements that are not genuine to the extent that they are not put into place for valid commercial reasons that reflect economic reality.    Controlled foreign company (CFC) rules:  in order to reduce their overall tax liability, corporate groups are able to shift profits to controlled subsidiaries in low-tax jurisdictions. CFC rules reattribute the income of a low-taxed controlled foreign subsidiary to its more highly taxed parent company. As a result of this, the parent company is charged to tax on this income in its country of residence.    Amending Directive (EU) 2017/952   Because Directive (EU) 2016/1164 only addressed hybrid mismatches  *  within the EU, a new Directive (EU)  2017/952  was adopted extending the scope to ensure the rules cover hybrid mismatches with non-EU countries. The rules of the latter directive supersede the rules on hybrid mismatches of Directive EU 2016/1164.   Rules on hybrid mismatches   :  where corporate taxpayers take advantage of disparities between national tax systems in order to reduce their overall tax liability, for instance through double deduction (i.e. deduction on both sides of the border) or a deduction of the income on one side of the border without its inclusion on the other side. To neutralise the effects of hybrid mismatch arrangements, the directive lays down rules whereby 1 of the 2 jurisdictions in a mismatch should deny the deduction of a payment leading to such an outcome.   from when does the directive apply  Directive (EU) 2016/1164 has applied since 8 August 2016 and had to become law in the EU countries by 31 December 2018.  Amending Directive (EU) 2017/952 has applied since 27 June 2017 and has to become law in the EU countries by 31 December 2019 (or by 31 December 2021 in the case of hybrid mismatches).   background   The directive builds on the  Action Plan for Fair and Efficient Corporate Taxation  and is in response to the finalisation of the project against  Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)  by the G20 and the  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)  .   key terms    Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS):  tax avoidance strategies that exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules to artificially shift profits to low or no-tax locations.   Hybrid mismatch:  an arrangement exploiting differences in the tax treatment of instruments, companies or transfers between 2 or more countries.
summary   In January 2012, only  14 %  of board members of major EU publicly listed companies and just  3 %  of the chairpersons of these companies were women.  Although on the EU's political agenda for many years, there is a renewed impetus in the promotion of  gender equality on the boards of the largest listed companies  . In 2010, the  European Commission  adopted its own strategy for equality between women and men. This was followed, in 2011, by its launch of the ‘Women on the board pledge for Europe’ which called on publicly listed companies in Europe to voluntarily commit to increasing women's presence-on their boards to 30 % by 2015 and 40 % by 2020.  Not having noted much progress, except in a few countries which had introduced laws (or had considered doing so), in 2012 the Commission issued a  communication  outlining the state of play in the field, accompanied by a  proposal  for an EU-wide law setting  procedural quotas  .  The communication looks at the reasons  why women are under-represented  in business leadership positions and the main obstacles to their career progression.    Traditional gender roles:  the division of labour, different educational choices (few women in sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) and concentration of women in a few occupational sectors.    Lack of support to balance care responsibilities with work,  which has an unbalanced impact on women’s and men’s work patterns.    Glass ceiling:  women need to overcome preconceptions about requirements for leadership positions, discrimination or stereotyping. ‘Subtle’ barriers may exist such as the perception that women are either not interested or incapable of performing certain tasks or that these posts are ‘male’ jobs.    Lack of transparency in recruitment and promotion practice:  the lack of women in senior positions influences companies’ decisions, including their attitude towards gender equality and the appointment of more female board members. Appointments to boards  rely heavily  on personal and professional contacts of current board members.   It is anticipated that opening the door to senior positions will encourage women to enter and stay in the workforce, thus helping to meet the employment target of 75 % set by the EU’s  Europe 2020 strategy  for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.  The communication suggests complementing the proposed law with a comprehensive approach that would  combine policy measures and financial support  to improve women’s participation in the labour market and in leadership positions. Examples of actions that will be supported are as follows:   initiatives to  combat stereotyped representations  of roles in society, labour market and leadership;   creation of a  social, economic and business environment  supportive of balanced participation in leadership positions;   promotion of the  business and economic case  for gender equality and balanced representation in decision making;   support for and monitoring of  progress towards balanced participation  of women and men in decision-making positions across the EU.   background     Women in economic decision-making in the EU     Women and men in leadership positions in the European Union, 2013    act   Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions — Gender balance in business leadership: a contribution to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth (  COM(2012) 615 final  of 14.11.2012)
   Exchange of information on criminal records between EU countries     Exchange of information on criminal records between EU countries     SUMMARY OF:      Framework Decision 2009/315/JHA — the exchange, between EU countries, of information extracted from criminal records      WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE FRAMEWORK DECISION?      It sets out the general principles for the functioning of the exchange of criminal records between EU countries, alongside Decision         2009/316/JHA        , which established the European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS).       It seeks to prevent criminals from escaping their past by moving to a different EU country than where they were convicted. It does this by ensuring that information on all their convictions is available whenever needed, irrespective of the EU country they were convicted in.       It was amended in 2019 by Directive (EU)         2019/884        , which regulates the exchange of information between EU countries on non-EU nationals and stateless persons and, along with Regulation (EU)         2019/816        , ensures that ECRIS will be more effective with respect to non-EU country nationals convicted within the EU. Directive (EU) 2019/884 also will replace Decision 2009/316/JHA from 28 June 2022.      KEY POINTS      Objectives      The objectives of the framework decision are to:      set an obligation for an EU country convicting a national of another EU country to transmit information on the conviction to the country of the person’s nationality;       define the obligations of the EU country of which the person is a national in storing the received information on convictions as well as the procedures that EU country must follow when replying to requests for information about its nationals;       establish a set of rules for the development of a computerised system of exchange of information on convictions.       Designation of authorities      EU countries must designate central authorities to carry out the tasks related to the exchange of information.      Registration of convictions and storage of information      A convicting EU country must register the nationality(ies) of the person convicted and notify the EU country(ies) of his/her nationality about details of the conviction, including information on:      the convicted person;       the nature and content of the conviction; and       the offence that led to the conviction.      The EU country of which the convicted person is a national must store information sent to it in order to reply to requests for information on convictions of its nationals. The reply should:      include information on convictions on its territory and in any other countries; and       be done within 10 working days, or within 20 working days if the request was made by a person concerning their own criminal record.       Exchanges of information       The information can be exchanged for the purpose of criminal proceedings or for any other legitimate purpose, e.g. pre-employment screenings. While the replies to requests for the purpose of criminal proceedings are obligatory, those for other purposes should be done in accordance with national law.       When a central authority of an EU country receives a request for information from any relevant national authority, it may in turn ask for information from another EU country, in particular from the country of nationality of the person concerned.       When a central authority of an EU country receives a request from a national of another EU country regarding their own criminal record, it must ask for information from the EU country of his/her nationality and include it in the issued certificate.       In 2017, the         European Commission        published a         report        on the exchange, through ECRIS, of information extracted from criminal records between EU countries.       Amending Directive (EU) 2019/884      The framework decision was amended in 2019 by Directive (EU) 2019/884, which aims to ensure the effective exchange of information on convictions of non-EU-country nationals (comprising also stateless persons and persons whose nationality is unknown) through ECRIS. The directive also ensures that ECRIS will be more effective with respect to non-EU-country nationals with prior convictions in an EU country. In addition, the directive:      obliges EU countries to ensure that convictions are accompanied by information on the nationality, or nationalities, of the convicted person, where this information is available;       introduces procedures to respond to requests for information;       ensures that a criminal record extract requested by a non-EU national is supplemented with information from other EU countries; and       lays down the technical modifications required to ensure the proper functioning of the information exchange system.      All data from criminal records must be stored exclusively in databases managed by the EU countries. The central authority of an EU country will not have direct access to the criminal records databases of the other EU countries.     The       European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA)      is responsible for maintaining and further developing the ECRIS reference application.      Implementation       A         report        published in 2016 by the European Commission describes the implementation of the framework decision in EU countries. Overall, it notes that significant progress has been made in the exchange of criminal records information between EU countries.       At the time of the report, 22 EU countries had notified the Commission of the measures they had taken to incorporate the framework decision into their national law. In the meantime, all EU countries have now notified the measures they have taken in this context.      FROM WHEN DOES THE FRAMEWORK DECISION APPLY?      The framework decision has applied since 27 April 2009. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 27 April 2012.       The changes introduced by amending Directive (EU) 2019/884 will apply in all EU countries as of 28 June 2022.

summary of   Regulation (EU) 2015/2017 — technical standards with regard to the adjusted factors to calculate the capital requirement for currency risk for currencies pegged to the euro in accordance with the Solvency 2 Directive   what is the aim of the regulation  It sets out the capital requirements for currencies pegged to the euro.   key points   Directive  2009/138/EC  , known as the Solvency 2 Directive, requires insurance companies to have enough own funds to withstand significant financial difficulties by meeting certain capital requirements.  Commission Delegated Regulation (EU)  2015/35  spells out these requirements in greater detail. In particular, insurance companies must have sufficient funds to cover any loss they may experience from either a 25% increase or decrease in the value of a foreign currency against the local currency.  This regulation, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2017:   replaces the 25% factor by lower percentages, ranging from 0.39% to 4.27%;   contains the adjusted factors for currency risk where the local or foreign currency is the euro, or is pegged to the euro;   applies to the Danish krone, the Bulgarian lev, the West African and Central African CFA francs and the Comorian franc.   from when does the regulation apply  It applies from 2 December 2015.   background   The  European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA)  supports coordination between national authorities and contributes to ensuring the consistent application of EU laws for the insurance and occupational pension sectors in EU countries.  EIOPA consulted widely on the technical standards contained in the regulation, analysing the potential related costs and benefits and presented its proposal to the  European Commission  for adoption.

summary of   Directive (EU) 2019/1158 on work-life balance for parents and carers   what is the aim of the directive   It seeks to ensure  gender equality  with respect to  labour market opportunities  and  treatment at work  throughout the EU by facilitating the work-life balance for workers who are parents or carers.   It sets out  minimum requirements  for family-related leaves (paternity, parental and carers’ leave) and flexible working arrangements.   It seeks to increase  women’s participation in the labour market  and to achieve a better sharing of caring responsibilities between men and women.   It creates incentives for men to assume an equal share of caring responsibilities by creating paid paternity and parental leave which is one of the reasons of the low take-up of leave by fathers.   The imbalance in the design of work-life balance policies between women and men reinforces gender stereotypes and differences between work and care. Policies on equal treatment should aim to address the issue of stereotypes in both men's and women's occupations and roles.   key points    Scope    The directive relates to all men and women who have an  employment contract  or an  employment relationship  as defined by the  law  ,  collective agreements  or  practice  in force in each EU country, taking into account the case-law of the  Court of Justice of the EU  .    Minimum rights   The directive provides for minimum individual rights related to the following:   paternity leave, parental leave and carers’ leave;   flexible working arrangements for workers who are parents, or carers; and   legal protection for those applying for or making use of family-related leave and flexible working arrangements.   EU countries may choose to introduce or maintain rules that are more favourable to workers.   Paternity leave    Fathers or equivalent second parents have the right to take  paternity leave of 10 working days  on the birth of a child.   Paternity leave has to be paid at the national sick pay level.   The  right to paternity leave  must  not be made subject  to a period of  work qualification  or to a length of  service qualification  .   EU countries may make the  right to a payment or an allowance  subject to periods of previous employment, which must not exceed 6 months immediately prior to the expected date of the birth of the child.    Parental leave    Each worker has an individual right to  4 months’ paid parental leave  , 2 months of which are  non-transferable  between the parents.   At least 2 months of parental leave per parent need to be paid at an adequate level.   EU countries may make the right to parental leave subject to a period of work qualification or to a length of service qualification, which must not exceed 1 year.   EU countries must ensure that workers have the right to request that they take parental leave in a flexible way, such as on a part-time basis, or in alternating periods of leave separated by periods of work.    Carers’ leave    The directive introduces rules for carers, namely  workers caring for relatives  requiring support due to serious medical reasons. These rules also cover care for a person who lives in the same household as the worker.   Each carer is entitled to take  5 working days  per year.    Flexible working arrangements    Workers with children up to a specified age, but at least 8, and carers have the right to request flexible working arrangements for caring purposes.   These arrangements include the use of remote working arrangements, flexible working schedules, or a reduction in working hours.   Employers must deal with these requests within a reasonable period of time and provide reasons for refusing or postponing such arrangements.   EU countries may make the right to request flexible working arrangements subject to a period of work qualification or to a length of service qualification. This period must not exceed 6 months.    Legal protection   EU countries must introduce rules to ensure:   workers are protected from discrimination and dismissal on the grounds that they have applied for, or have taken, family-related leave or flexible working arrangements;   workers who consider that they have been dismissed on the basis that they have exercised such rights should be able to ask the employer to provide duly substantiated grounds for the dismissal;   the previous job and the rights acquired or in the process of being acquired before leave by the worker are maintained after the leave.    Repeal   The directive repeals Directive  2010/18/EU  on parental leave from 2 August 2022.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 1 August 2019 and has to become law in the EU countries by 2 August 2022 (except for the payment of the last 2 weeks of parental leave, for which the deadline is 2 August 2024).   background   For more information, see:    Work-life balance  (  European Commission  ).
   Towards a Community programme for flood risk management     Towards a Community programme for flood risk management     Given the risks to health, property and the environment, the Commission analyses the measures already taken and proposes an action programme on flood prevention, protection and mitigation.     ACT     Commission Communication of 12 July 2004 "Flood risk management - flood prevention, protection and mitigation" [       COM(2004) 472      final - Official Journal C 49, 28 February 2006].     SUMMARY      The situation with regard to flooding      Between 1998 and 2002, Europe suffered over 100 major floods, including the catastrophic floods along the Danube and Elbe rivers in 2002. These floods had a disastrous impact on the people affected, in terms of their health (some 700 fatalities since 1998), their social situation (displacement of about half a million people) and their economic situation (at least EUR 25 billion in insured economic losses). These floods also had severe environmental consequences (risks of contamination when waste water treatment plants are affected or chemicals are involved, destruction of biodiversity, etc.).     The Commission indicates that river and coastal floods vary considerably in size and duration and that the root causes of floods (rainfall, storms or major variations in sea level) are natural phenomena and essentially uncontrollable. However, it also points out that the damage resulting from floods is very much influenced by human actions (clearing of forests, straightening of rivers, and extensive building in high-risk areas, etc.).     Lastly, the Commission considers that the frequency of flooding will increase (as a result of climate change and the growing increase in the number of people and economic assets in flood risk zones), calling for concerted action at EU level.      Action undertaken and in progress      The EU already has a number of instruments for flood prevention and management:      in the research area, with the         5th and 6th research framework programmes        ;       in the regional policy area, in particular with the         Structural Funds        , e.g. the         INTERREG        initiative and the         Cohesion Fund        ;       with the EU         solidarity fund        , which grants rapid financial assistance;       in the field of the common agricultural policy, the reform of which focuses, in particular, on         rural development        ;       in the environmental field, the         Water Framework Directive        will help to mitigate the effects of floods, even if this is not one of its main objectives, and the establishment of the monitoring and information centre (MIC) will serve to improve the preparedness of the national protection authorities.      For their part, several Member States have drawn up flood protection plans and strategies and flood risk maps. Their level of involvement and the type of initiatives they take depend however on the type of flood risk (river, coastal, etc.) to which the country is exposed and the degree of risk.     In addition, international cooperation is being established for river basins such as the Rhine, Oder, Meuse, Danube, Saar, Moselle and Elbe: the countries bordering these rivers have established bodies to ensure a coordinated approach to flood risk management and cross-border protection plans.      Towards a European action programme      The Commission proposes that the Member States should cooperate with it to draw up and implement a coordinated action programme for flood prevention, protection and mitigation.     This action plan would include in particular:      improving cooperation and coordination between Member States through the development and implementation of flood risk management plans for each adversely affected river basin and coastal zone;       development and implementation of flood risk maps by the Member States;       improving information exchange, sharing of experiences, and the coordinated development and promotion of best practices; these measures would in particular fall within the area of responsibility of the Commission;       developing stronger linkages between the research community and the authorities responsible for flood management;       improving coordination between the relevant Community policies;       increasing awareness of flood risks through wider stakeholder participation and more effective communication.      Lastly, in an annex, the communication sets out guidelines concerning the essential features of the flood risk management plans and flood risk maps to be drawn up by the Member States.     RELATED ACTS      Directive         2007/60/EC        of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2007 on the assessment and         management of flood risks        [Official Journal L 288, 6.11.2007].      The objective of this Directive is to reduce and manage flood-related risks to human health, the environment and property, in particular along rivers and in coastal areas. It provides in particular for the evaluation of flood risk in river basins by 2011 and for flood mapping in all areas with a significant flood risk by 2013. It also provides for coordination within shared river basins, and for producing flood risk management plans through a broad participatory and cooperation process between Member States by 2015.

summary of   Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste   what is the aim of the directive  Directive 94/62/EC sets out the  EU  ’s rules on managing packaging and packaging waste.  Directive 94/62/EC aims at:   harmonising national measures concerning the management of packaging and packaging waste; and    improving the quality of the  environment  by preventing and reducing the impact of packaging and packaging waste on the environment.   Directive (EU)  2018/852  is the last amendment of Directive 94/62/EC and contains updated measures designed to:   prevent the production of packaging waste, and    promote the reuse, recycling and other forms of recovering of packaging waste, instead of its final disposal, thus contributing to the transition towards a circular economy  *  .   key points    Scope   The directive covers all packaging placed on the European market and all packaging waste, whether it is used or released at industrial, commercial, office, shop, service, household or any other level, regardless of the material used.   Measures   The directive as amended requires EU countries to take measures, such as national programmes, incentives through extended producer responsibility schemes and other economic instruments, to prevent the generation of packaging waste and to minimise the environmental impact of packaging.  EU countries should encourage the increase in the share of reusable packaging  *  put on the market and of systems to reuse packaging in an environmentally sound manner without compromising  food safety  or the safety of consumers. This may include:   deposit-return schemes   targets   economic incentives   minimum percentages of reusable packaging placed on the market for each type of packaging, etc.   EU countries must also take the necessary measures to meet recycling targets which vary depending on a packaging material. For this purpose, they must apply the new calculation rules for reporting on the new recycling targets to be achieved by 2025 and 2030.   Targets   By 31 December 2025, at least 65% by weight of all packaging waste must be recycled. The recycling targets per material are:   50% of plastic   25% of wood   70% of ferrous metals   50% of aluminium   70% of glass, and   75% of paper and cardboard.   By 31 December 2030, at least 70% by weight of all packaging waste must be recycled. This includes:   55% of plastic   30% of wood   80% of ferrous metals   60% of aluminium   75% of glass and   85% of paper and cardboard.    Essential requirements   EU countries must ensure that the packaging placed on the market meets the essential requirements contained in Annex II of the directive:   to limit the weight and volume of packaging to a minimum adequate amount in order to still meet the required level of safety, hygiene and acceptability for the packed product and for the consumers;   to minimise the content of hazardous substances and materials in the packaging material and its components;   to design reusable or recoverable packaging, which may include design for material or organic recycling as well as design for energy recovery.   The amended directive clarified the difference between packaging recoverable in the form of composting and biodegradable packaging waste and specified that oxo-degradable plastic packaging (plastic packaging with additives causing it to break down into microscopic particles and contributing to the presence of microplastics in the environment)is not considered as biodegradable packaging.  The  European Commission  is currently examining how to reinforce the essential requirements with the view to improving packaging design for reuse and promoting high-quality recycling, as well as strengthening the enforcement of the essential requirements.   Packaging recovery systems   EU countries should ensure that systems are set up to provide for the return and/or collection of used packaging and/or packaging waste, as well as the reuse or recovery including recycling of the packaging and/or packaging waste collected.   Producer responsibility    By end of 2024, EU countries should ensure that producer responsibility schemes  *  are established for all packaging. Producer responsibility schemes provide for the financing or financing and organisation of the return and/or collection of used packaging and/or packaging waste and its channelling to the most appropriate waste management option, as well as for reuse or recycling of the collected packaging and packaging waste.   These schemes will need to comply with minimum requirements established under Waste Framework Directive  2008/98/EC  (see  summary  ). The schemes should help incentivise packaging that is designed, produced and commercialised in a way that promotes packaging reuse or high quality recycling and minimise the impact of packaging and packaging waste on the environment.    Information systems and reporting    An  implementing act  , Decision  2005/270/EC  sets out the formats, as well as the rules for the calculation, verification and reporting of data that must be provided by EU countries to the Commission each year to monitor the implementation of Directive 94/62/EC.   Decision (EU)  2019/665  amends Decision 2005/270/EC introducing new rules to bring it into line with the new rules in Directive 94/62/EC regarding the calculation of the attainment of the recycling targets relating to:   the possibility of taking into account — up to maximum 5% of the recycling target — reusable sales packaging (Article 5(2)),   the possibility of taking into account wooden packaging repaired for reuse (in Article 5(3)),   the calculation of the amount of metals in packaging waste separated from incineration bottom ash after incinerated (Article 6a),   composite packaging, which should no longer be reported per predominant material, but rather per material contained in the packaging, with a possible derogations for materials that constitute less than 5% of the total mass of the packaging unit.      The new calculation rules aim at making sure that only waste that enters a recycling operation or waste that has achieved end of waste status should be used for the calculation of the recycling target and, as a general rule, the measurement of waste should be at the input to the recycling operation.   the decision provides for an enhanced system of quality control on reported data (data directly from economic operators, use of electronic registries), thus ensuring a better traceability of reported data, including on waste exported for recycling to non-EU third countries.   Decision (EU) 2019/665 also introduces changes to the formats for reporting data pursuant to Article 12 of Directive 94/62/EC. The formats should take into account the information on reusable packaging placed on the market for the first time and on the number of rotations that packaging performs per year — essential to determining the share of reusable packaging compared to single use packaging. As reusable sales packaging may be taken into account in the context of the recycling targets, a distinction must be made between reusable sales packaging and other reusable packaging.   from when does the directives apply   Directive 94/62/EC has applied since 31 December 1994 and had to become law in the EU countries by 30 June 1996.   Amending Directive (EU) 2018/852 has applied since 4 July 2018 and had to become law in the EU countries by 5 July 2020.   background   For more information, see:    Packaging and packaging waste  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Circular economy:  a circular economy minimises resource input, waste, emissions and energy leakage. It can be achieved through long-lasting design, maintenance, repair, reuse and recycling. It contrasts to a linear economy which extracts resources, uses them, then throws them away.   Reusable packaging:  packaging which has been conceived, designed and marketed to carry out multiple trips in its lifetime by being refilled or reused for the same purpose for which it was conceived.   Extended Producer responsibility schemes:  systems set up to ensure that producers bear the financial or financial and organisational responsibility for the management of waste stage of a product’s life cycle. By modulating the fees payable by producers for placing packaging on the market, EPR schemes allow producers and EU countries to encourage the design of products and their components which are more respective of the environment.
summary of   Directive 2009/33/EC on promoting clean and energy-efficient road transport vehicles   what is the aim of the directive  It aims at promoting and stimulating the development of a market for clean and energy-efficient vehicles.  It requires public authorities and certain other public transport operators to take into account the impact of these vehicles during their operational lifetime in terms of:    energy  consumption;   CO  2  emissions; and   other pollutant emissions.   key points    Scope   The directive applies to contracts for the purchase of road transport vehicles entered into by:   contracting authorities and contracting entities;   operators of public service obligations under a public service contract.    Purchase of clean and energy-efficient road transport vehicles   EU countries must ensure that contracting authorities, contracting entities and operators under a public service contract take into account the operational lifetime energy and environmental impacts when purchasing road transport vehicles.  Energy and environmental impacts include:   energy consumption;   emissions of CO  2  ;   emissions of NOx, non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) and particulate matter.   To meet the requirement to take into account the environmental impact of vehicles, contracting authorities, contracting entities and public transport operators can choose:   to set technical specifications for energy and environmental performance in the documentation they draw up when the vehicle is purchased; or   to include energy and environmental impacts in the purchasing decision.    Methodology for the calculation of operational lifetime costs   The directive prescribes a  methodology  to calculate the cost of energy consumption, CO  2  emissions and pollutant emissions during a vehicle’s operational lifetime where the contracting authority, contracting entity or the operator under a public service contract has chosen to include the energy and environmental impacts in the purchasing decision.  The  operational lifetime cost of the energy consumption  of a vehicle is calculated using the following method:   fuel consumption per kilometre is calculated in units of energy consumption per kilometre;   the calculation uses a single monetary value per unit of energy;   the operational lifetime cost of the energy consumption of a vehicle is calculated by multiplying the mileage already performed by energy consumption, and then by the cost per unit of energy.   The  cost of CO  2  emissions  is calculated by multiplying the mileage already performed by CO  2  emissions in kilograms per kilometre, and then by the cost per kilogram.  The  cost of pollutant emissions  is obtained by adding the costs related to emissions of NOx, NMHC and particulate matter.   Sharing best practice   The  European Commission  encourages the sharing of knowledge and best practice between EU countries with a view to promoting the purchase of clean and energy-efficient road transport vehicles.  Several initiatives are under way that ensure the directive is implemented. These include:   guidelines on  green public procurement  and a  technical background report  ;   the  European Green Vehicle Initiative  which seeks to support the development of green vehicles and sustainable mobility solutions;   the  European Clean Bus deployment initiative  ; and    various studies  .   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 4 June 2009 and had to become law in the EU countries from 4 December 2010.   background   The EU’s climate and energy package includes targets for 2020 for  energy efficiency  , a target minimum share for  renewable energy  and targets for  reducing greenhouse gas emissions  . The transport sector can make a significant contribution to meeting these targets.  For more information, see:    Clean vehicles directive  (  European Commission  ).   related document   Report from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the application of Directive 2009/33/EC on the promotion of clean and energy efficient road transport vehicles (  COM (2013) 214 final  , 18.4.2013)
   Reduction in CO2 emissions of new passenger cars and of new light commercial vehicles     Reduction in CO       2      emissions of new passenger cars and of new light commercial vehicles     SUMMARY OF:      Regulation (EU) 2019/631 — setting CO         2        emission performance standards for new passenger cars and for new light commercial vehicles      WHAT IS THE AIM OF THIS REGULATION?     It aims to make road transport cleaner, to meet the       EU      ’s       greenhouse-gas-emission-reduction targets      for 2021-2030 and to contribute to the goals of the       Paris Agreement      .     KEY POINTS      The regulation sets out CO         2        emissions performance requirements for new passenger cars and for new light commercial vehicles (i.e. vans).       These requirements will contribute to achieving the EU’s target of reducing, by 2030, its greenhouse gas emissions in the sectors not covered by the         emissions trading system (ETS)        by 30% compared to 2005.       Emission-reduction targets       Compared to 2021, the regulation requires that the annual EU fleet-wide average CO         2        emissions from new cars and new vans be reduced:          by 15% for the period             2025-2029            ;           by 37.5% for new cars and 31% for new vans from             2030            onwards.         The specific CO         2        emissions targets that manufacturers have to achieve each year are based on these EU fleet-wide targets, taking into account the average mass of their respective new vehicle fleets.       Each year, the         European Commission        establishes the specific CO         2        emissions target for each manufacturer. It also determines their average emissions from the previous year in order to evaluate their performance in complying with these targets (for 2018, see Commission Implementing Decision (EU)         2020/1035        ).       Manufacturers exceeding their specific emissions target will have to pay an excess-emission premium of €95 per g/km exceedance for each new vehicle registered.       Incentives for the uptake of zero- and low-emission vehicles (ZLEVs)       Until 2022, passenger cars with CO         2        emissions of less than 50 g/km may be counted multiple times for calculating the average specific emissions of CO         2        of a manufacturer: as 2 cars in 2020, as 1.66 cars in 2021 and as 1.33 cars in 2022. A manufacturer may benefit from a maximum of 7.5 g/km of such ‘super-credits’ accumulated over those 3 years.       The specific CO         2        emission target for a manufacturer will be relaxed if its share of ZLEVs (vehicles with emissions from 0 up to 50 g/km) registered in a given year exceeds the following benchmarks:          cars: 15% ZLEVs from 2025 on and 35% ZLEVs from 2030 on,           vans: 15% ZLEVs from 2025 on and 30% ZLEVs from 2030 on.         For calculating the ZLEV share in a manufacturer’s fleet, an accounting rule applies. This gives a greater weight to ZLEVs with lower CO         2        emissions.       Derogations, pooling and eco-innovations       These are measures that make it easier for manufacturers to meet their targets.       The derogation for manufacturers registering between 10,000 and 300,000 passenger cars will cease to exist from 2029 on.       Robust emissions data      New rules aim to ensure the robustness and real-world representativeness of the emissions data recorded by requiring:      authorities to verify that the CO         2        emissions and fuel consumption values recorded by the manufacturers in the conformity certificates correspond to the values of those vehicles when in service;       the Commission to monitor the real-world CO         2        emissions and fuel or energy consumption data of vehicles.       Review      As announced in the       European Green Deal      and the       2030 climate target plan      , the Commission will review the regulation by June 2021.     FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?     It has applied since 1 January 2020.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products   summary    what does the regulation do   It lays down criteria for designating certain medicinal products as orphan drugs* to prevent, diagnose and treat  rare conditions  .   It provides incentives for their research, development and marketing.   key points    For a product to acquire orphan drug status, manufacturers must show that:   it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting fewer than 5 in 10,000 people in the EU, or   without incentives, the sale of the drug in the EU would not generate sufficient income to justify the necessary investment, and   no satisfactory alternative exists or, if there are treatments, the proposed treatment should have a significant benefit.     The  Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products  :   examines applications for orphan drug status;   gives its opinion within 90 days of receiving the application;   advises the  European Commission  on developing an EU orphan drug policy;   assists the Commission in liaising internationally on orphan drug issues;   helps the Commission to draw up detailed guidelines.     The Commission adopts the final opinion on an orphan drug application within 30 days of receiving the committee's opinion. The  European Medicines Agency  may:   offer advice on the necessary tests and trials if the developer of an orphan drug so requests;   waive all or part of the market authorisation fees.     Manufacturers of an orphan drug can benefit from:   exclusive marketing rights for up to 10 years (this may be cut to 6 years if the drug is sufficiently profitable after 5 years; it may be extended to 12 years if the product's possible effects on children have been studied),   other incentives, particularly for SMEs, to support the research and development of orphan drugs.     Before 22 January 2001, the Commission was to publish a detailed inventory of all the available incentives and update it regularly.   Before 22 January 2006, the Commission was to publish a report on the legislation’s implementation and its public health benefits.   In 2016, the Commission published an updated version of the  inventory  .   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 22 January 2000.   background   Some medical conditions are so rare that under normal market conditions, pharmaceutical companies would be unwilling to invest in their research. Products to treat these conditions are known as orphan drugs and require incentives if they are to be successfully developed.  For more information, see:    ‘Orphan designation’  on the European Medicines Agency’s website    ‘Orphan medicinal products’  on the European Commission’s website   key term    * Orphan drugs  : drugs developed to treat rare diseases. They are so called because the pharmaceutical industry has little financial interest in developing and marketing products intended for only a small number of patients suffering from very rare conditions.   act   Regulation (EC) No  141/2000  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1999 on orphan medicinal products (OJ L 18, 22.1.2000, pp. 1–5)  Subsequent amendments to Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 have been incorporated into the basic text.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 1007/2009 on trade in seal products   summary    what does this regulation do  It sets out harmonised rules for placing seal products on the EU market.   key points    Seal products may only be placed on the market in the EU if they come from hunts carried out by Inuit* or other indigenous communities. The hunt must:   be traditionally conducted by the community   contribute to the community’s subsistence in order to provide food and income and not be primarily conducted for commercial reasons   pay due care to animal welfare, while taking account of the community’s way of life and the subsistence purpose of the hunt.     When being placed on the market, a seal product must have a certificate confirming all the above conditions have been complied with.   Bodies authorised by the  European Commission  issue the certificates.   Travellers and their families may import seal products which are for their personal use. If such products are to be imported at a later date, the travellers should have the relevant documentation.   If the Commission has evidence that products come from a seal hunt conducted primarily for commercial reasons, it may ban, or limit, their being placed on the EU market.   The Commission informs the public, the competent authorities and the customs authorities about the conditions under which seal products may be placed on the market in the EU.   By 31 December 2018, and then every 4 years, EU countries report to the Commission on the measures they have taken to implement the legislation.   The Commission, within a year of receiving the national reports, provides an overall report to the  European Parliament  and the  Council  . The first report will be submitted by 31 December 2019.   from when does the regulation apply  It applies since 20 November 2009.   background   Seals are hunted inside and outside the EU for a variety of purposes. They are used to obtain meat, oil, blubber, organs and fur skins, and for articles as diverse as Omega-3 capsules and clothing.    Trade in seal products    key term    * Inuit  : indigenous members of the Inuit homeland, namely those arctic and subarctic areas where, presently or traditionally, Inuit have aboriginal rights and interests, recognised by Inuit as being members of their people. The term includes Inupiat, Yupik (Alaska), Inuit, Inuvialuit (Canada), Kalaallit (Greenland) and Yupik (Russia).   act   Regulation (EC) No  1007/2009  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 on trade in seal products (OJ L 286, 31.10.2009, pp. 36–39)  Successive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1007/2009 have been incorporated into the basic text.

act   White Paper - Roadmap to a single European transport area - Towards a competitive and resource-efficient transport system (  COM(2011) 144 final  of 28 March 2011).   summary    what does the roadmap do  It sets out 40 specific action points and lists 131 concrete initiatives for the next decade to build a competitive transport system that will remove major bottlenecks and move people and goods efficiently and safely throughout the European Union (EU). The proposals should reduce the EU’s dependence on imported oil, achieve essentially CO  2  -free city mobility in major urban centres by 2030 and cut transport carbon emissions by 60 % by 2050.   key points   The roadmap identifies the following goals for guiding policy action:   reduce the use of petrol and diesel cars in cities by half by 2030, phasing them out completely by 2050 and achieve CO  2  -free city mobility by 2030;   increase the use of low-carbon sustainable fuels in  air transport  to 40 % by 2050;   reduce EU CO  2  emissions from  ship  fuels by 40 % by 2050;   switch 30 % of road freight travelling over 300 km to rail and waterborne transport by 2030, and over 50 % by 2050;   triple the existing high-speed rail network by 2030. The majority of medium-distance passenger transport should go by rail by 2050;   establish a fully functioning, EU-wide  TEN-T  core network integrating all forms of transport by 2030;   connect major airports to rail and core seaports and rail and inland waterways by 2050;   introduce traffic management systems for the various transport modes, such as for  rail  and  road  ;   develop a  multimodal transport information management  and  payment  system by 2020;   halve road casualties by 2020 and reduce these to almost zero by 2050;   fully apply the ‘user pays’ (i.e. those who use infrastructure pay for it) and ‘polluter pays’ (i.e. those who pollute pay for it) principles.   This comprehensive strategy for transport seeks to create a competitive transport system that will increase mobility, remove major barriers in key areas and fuel growth and employment by 2050. It is complemented by initiatives, such as:    Horizon 2020 programme  with its support for research and innovation on smart, green and integrated transport;    Connecting Europe Facility  , which provides finance for 10 transnational transport infrastructure projects;    Roadmap to a low-carbon economy  by 2020 in which transport is a key sector to reach that goal;   various  energy efficiency measures  to reduce Europe’s use of primary energy by 20 % by 2020.

summary of   Directive 2009/24/EC — the legal protection of computer programs   what is the aim of the directive  It aims to clarify and remove differences between the legal protection of computer programs in different European Union (EU) countries in order to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal market.   key points    EU countries must protect computer programs by  copyright  .   Programs should be protected as literary works, within the meaning of the  Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.    Computer programs include their preparatory design material.    Scope   The protection provided for in this directive applies to:   the  expression  of a computer program in any form, but not  ideas and principles which underlie  a computer program or any elements of it;   a computer program which is original in the sense that it is the  author’s own intellectual creation  ;   computer programs created before 1 January 1993, without prejudice to any acts concluded and rights acquired before that date.    Authorship    The author of a computer program is the  person or group of people  who have created the program or, where national legislation permits, a  legal person,  i.e. a company or other legal entity.   If several persons participate in creating a program, the exclusive rights are held jointly by these persons.   If an  employee  creates a computer program in the course of his duties or following the instructions given by his employer, the  employer  exclusively has the economic rights relating to that computer program.    Exclusive rights of the rights-holder   The holder of the rights to a computer program may do, or may authorise others to do, the following:   the permanent or temporary  reproduction  of the program, or a part thereof;   the translation, adaptation, arrangement and any other alteration of the program;   the  distribution  of the programme.    Limitations of those exclusive rights (no need for prior authorisation from the rights-holder)    A lawful acquirer of a program may reproduce, translate, adapt, arrange or alter the program, when it is necessary in order to use the program in accordance with its intended purpose.   A person having a right to use the computer program may make a  back-up copy  in so far as it is necessary for that use.   This person may also observe, study or test the functioning of the program in order to determine the ideas and principles which underlie any element of the program.    Decompilation   *   Prior authorisation from the rights-holder is not required where reproduction of the code and translation of its form are essential to obtain information necessary to achieve the  interoperability   *  of a new computer program with other programs.  The following conditions apply:   those acts are performed by the  licensee  or another person having a right to use a copy of a program;   the information on interoperability has not previously been readily available;   those acts are confined to the parts of the original program which are necessary in order to achieve interoperability.    Special measures of protection   Measures must be taken by EU countries against persons who commit any of the following:   putting into circulation an  infringing copy  of a computer program;   possession of an infringing copy of a program for  commercial purposes  ;   putting into circulation or owning, for commercial purposes, any means whose sole purpose is to allow the unauthorised removal or bypassing of any  technical protection device.    An infringing copy of a computer program may be seized in accordance with EU countries’ national laws.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 25 May 2009. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 31 December 1992, the date indicated in the  Directive 91/250/EEC  that is  codified  by Directive 2009/24/EC.   background   For more information, see:    Protection of computer programs    * key terms     Decompilation:  the conversion of program code into a higher-level programming language that can be read by a human.     Interoperability:  the ability of a system or product to work with other systems or products without the need for any further action on the part of the consumer.
   Seventh Framework Programme (2007 to 2013)     Seventh Framework Programme (2007 to 2013)     Research is a component of a knowledge triangle (the other two being education and innovation) meant to boost growth and employment in the European Union (EU) in the context of a global economy. The 7th Framework Programme for Research, covering the period 2007 to 2013, is an opportunity for the EU to match its research policy to its ambitions in terms of economic and social policy by consolidating the European Research Area (ERA). In order to achieve this objective, the Commission hopes to increase the EU's annual spending on research, thereby generating more national and private investment in this field. When it is implemented, the 7th Framework Programme will also have to respond to the research and knowledge needs of industry and more generally of EU policies. The Framework Programme is organised around four main programmes and has been greatly simplified so as to be more effective and more accessible to researchers.     ACTS     Decision No       1982/2006/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (2007-13).     Council Decision       969/2006/EC      of 18 December 2006 concerning the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) or nuclear research and training activities (2007-11).     SUMMARY     The 7th Framework Programme is adapted to the EU’s needs in terms of growth and employment. After wide-ranging public consultation, four main objectives have been identified, which correspond to the four specific programmes around which the European research effort is to be structured.      Four main specific programmes      The       Cooperation      Programme aims to stimulate cooperation and improve links between industry and research within a transnational framework. The aim is for Europe to gain and consolidate leadership in key research areas. The programme will have nine themes, which are to be managed autonomously but will be complementary in terms of implementation:      health;       food, agriculture and biotechnology;       information and communication technologies;       nanosciences, nanotechnologies, materials and new production technologies;       energy;       environment (including climate change);       transport (including aeronautics);       socio-economic sciences and the humanities;       security and space.      The       Ideas      Programme is intended to enhance exploratory research in Europe, i.e. aimed at discovering new knowledge that fundamentally changes our vision of the world and our way of life. In order to achieve this, the new European Research Council will support the most ambitious and innovative research projects. Within this new structure, at the forefront of European research, there will be an autonomous Scientific Council, which will identify priorities and scientific strategies. The aim is to enhance European research excellence by promoting competition and risk-taking.     The       People      Programme will harness significant financial resources that can be used to improve the career prospects of researchers in Europe and attract more high-quality young researchers. The Commission hopes to encourage training and mobility so that European researchers can realise their full potential. The programme will reinforce the existing "Marie Curie" actions, which for several years have been offering mobility and training opportunities to European researchers.     The       Capacities      Programme is intended to give researchers powerful tools that will enable them to enhance the quality and competitiveness of European research. This means more investment in research infrastructure in the less successful regions, in the creation of regional research-driven clusters and in research for the benefit of SMEs. This programme also has to reflect the importance of international cooperation in research and the role of science in society.     Furthermore, the 7th Framework Programme will finance the direct actions of the       Joint Research Centre (JRC)      and the actions covered by the       Euratom Framework Programme      in the fields of:      research into fusion energy;       nuclear fission and radiation protection.       Change in the duration of the programme      The 7th Framework Programme takes over many features from previous programmes that have had a positive effect on European research. This is the case with the projects run by European partner groups, which will continue to have a central role in the Framework Programme. Similarly, the Commission places the Framework Programme within the context of the European Research Area, which brings together all of the EU's activities in this field. The extension of the programme from four to seven years is indicative of the EU’s sustained commitment to stimulating European research.     While preserving the best aspects of the previous programmes, the 7th Framework Programme introduces new measures designed to improve the coherence and effectiveness of the EU’s research policy. The main innovations introduced in this framework programme are:      simplification of the procedures for participation in the programme;       implementation of the programme and its budget by theme instead of by instrument, so that it may function more coherently and effectively;       creation of the European Research Council under the Ideas Programme to support exploratory research;       improved cooperation with industry via the Joint Technology Initiatives, which will combine private investment and public funding;       the support of a European research infrastructures policy;       creation of a Risk Sharing Finance Facility to make it easier for participants to access European Investment Bank loans.      As was the case during the       Sixth Framework Programme      , several research areas will       not      receive Community financing:      reproductive human cloning       research aiming to alter human genetic stock such that modifications become heritable;       research aiming to create human embryos solely for research purposes or for stem cell procurement.       A simplified Framework Programme      Since 1984, various framework programmes have increased the number of administrative and financial procedures which govern the EU's research effort. The Commission hopes to continue the process of simplification launched under the previous framework programme, thereby making the financing and management of research projects more effective.     Specific measures designed to simplify the framework programme’s implementation include:      streamlining of funding schemes and a more limited choice of instruments for more coherent funding;       use of simpler and less bureaucratic language in order to be more comprehensible to the general public;       reduction in the number and size of official documents;       simplification of the procedures participants have to go through;       reduction in the number of preliminary checks prior to the adoption of a project;       greater autonomy for partner groups;       simplification of the selection procedure for projects.       A budget that is large but necessary      The Commission is proposing a budget of EUR 50 521 million for the period of 2007-13, i.e. an average of EUR 7 217 per annum. This total is in fact one and a half times that of the annual budget of the 6th Framework Programme, set at EUR 4 375 per annum, i.e. a total of EUR 17 500 million over four years). The budget will be broken down as follows:      Cooperation: EUR 32 413 million.       Ideas: EUR 7 513 million.       People: EUR 4 750 million.       Capacities: EUR 4 097 million.       Non-nuclear actions taken by the JRC: EUR 1 751 million.       Euratom: EUR 2 700 million (2007-11).      This increase reflects the importance of research in the       relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy      , which aims to make Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge economy in the world. Recently, Europe has missed big opportunities in certain key areas due to a lack of available funds. This Framework Programme will make it possible to finance more quality projects and enhance the EU’s innovation capacity.     Knowledge and technology are Europe’s main advantages and represent the foundation for growth and employment. The Framework Programme is intended to have a leverage effect on national research spending, in order to achieve the objective of spending 3 % of GDP on research in Europe. The Commission intends to play a central role in driving and coordinating European research, so that knowledge is placed at the service of growth and employment in Europe.      Background      Since 1984, the EU has run its research and technological development policy on the basis of multiannual framework programmes. The 7th Framework Programme is the second since the launching of the       Lisbon Strategy      in 2000 and should play a fundamental role in growth and employment in Europe in years to come. The Commission wants to develop the knowledge triangle formed by research, education and innovation policies, in order to place knowledge at the service of a dynamic economy and social and environmental progress.

The 7th Framework Programme is adapting to help the EU meet its goals of creating a low carbon, knowledge-based society. It seeks to increase public and private R&D investment and to diversify its instruments in order to maximise European added value.     FP7 is crucial in promoting scientific excellence and technological. Its role is even more important now given the current economic situation. FP7 contributes to sustained research efforts, both private and public, as exemplified in the public private partnership initiatives for green cars, energy efficient buildings and factories of the future launched as part of the European Recovery Plan.     The Commission has requested a group of experts to carry out an interim evaluation of FP7 in order to improve its impact on shaping the European Research Area. The conclusions from this evaluation will feed into the debates on the future financial frameworks of the European Union, the post-2010 Lisbon Strategy and the next Framework Programme.

   Healthy diet for a healthy life     Healthy diet for a healthy life     Faced with the increase in obesity in the European Union (EU) and in conditions related to obesity, the European Commission invites Member States to take common measures to tackle this phenomenon.     ACT     Commission Recommendation No       2010/250/EU      of 28 April 2010 on the research joint programming initiative “A healthy diet for a healthy life”.     SUMMARY     Through this Recommendation, the European Commission invites Member States to develop and implement a common strategy for the prevention of diet-related diseases.      What are the risks related to poor diet?      Overweight and       obesity      may lead to conditions such as:      cardiovascular disease;       hypertension;       type 2 diabetes;       strokes;       certain cancers;       musculo-skeletal disorders;       certain mental health conditions.      However, these risks could be reduced if individuals were to adopt       healthy behaviour      , particularly in terms of diet. If lifestyle risk factors were eliminated, around 80 % of cases of heart disease, strokes and type 2 diabetes, and 40 % of cancers, could be avoided.      Which measures are Member States invited to put in place?      In order for research in the area of diet-related diseases to be more effective, the Commission invites Member States to develop and implement       a strategic research agenda      based on a common approach to the prevention of diet-related diseases.     The agenda shall contain an       implementation plan      establishing priorities and timelines and the action, instruments and resources required.     The strategic research agenda and implementation plan shall include the following actions in particular:      identifying and exchanging information on relevant national programmes and research activities;       identifying areas or research activities that would benefit from coordination or joint calls for proposals or pooling of resources;       exchanging information, resources, best practices, methods and guidelines, while establishing clinical studies;       exporting and disseminating knowledge, innovation and interdisciplinary approaches;       creating a network between existing specialised centres.      Member States shall set up a       common management structure      to establish common conditions, rules and procedures for cooperation and coordination. They shall also monitor implementation of the strategic research agenda.      Context      Overweight and obesity have increased greatly among European Union citizens over the past three decades. This trend is becoming more pronounced with time. The       Competitiveness      Council which met on 3 December 2009 recognised the need to launch a joint programming initiative to be led by Member States and facilitated by the Commission.

summary of   Regulation (EC) No 80/2009 on a Code of Conduct for computerised reservation systems   summary    what does this regulation do   It sets out a harmonised Code of Conduct on the use of computerised reservation systems (CRS) to ensure fair competition and protection of consumers’ rights.   It applies to air transport (and to rail transport when this is combined with a flight).   key points     System vendors* must not  :   attach any unfair or unjustified conditions on airlines or on their own subscribers;   prevent an airline from using other reservation systems, including its own internet booking service and call centres;   reserve any specific loading or processing procedures for one or more participating carriers.      System vendors must  :   load and process data provided by airlines with equal care and timeliness;   publicly disclose the extent of a direct or indirect capital holding they have in an airline or vice versa;   provide a principal display for each individual transaction through its CRS;   clearly identify in the display any airlines that are banned from flying within the EU;   process personal data only for the purposes (making a reservation or issuing a ticket) for which they were given;   submit an independently audited report on their ownership structure and governance model every 4 years.     System vendors may make available marketing, booking and sales data, provided these are offered on a non-discriminatory basis to all participating carriers and do not identify the customer.   If system vendors in a non-EU country discriminate against EU carriers, the  European Commission  may require vendors operating in the EU to apply the same treatment to that country’s airlines.   The Commission may impose fines not exceeding 10 % of the previous year’s total turnover on companies which intentionally or negligently fail to comply with the legislation.   In 2009, the Commission adopted an  explanatory note  explaining how it interprets the concept of a ‘parent carrier’ which may be able to have a decisive influence on the running of the system vendor's business.   from when does the regulation apply  It applies since 29 March 2009.   background   For more information, see  ‘Air transport — Distribution networks — CRS’  on the European Commission’s website.   key term    * System vendor  : any body and its affiliates responsible for operating or marketing a CRS.   act   Regulation (EC) No  80/2009  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 January 2009 on a Code of Conduct for computerised reservation systems and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 2299/89 (OJ L 35, 4.2.2009, pp. 47-55)
summary of  Regulation (EU) 2019/26 — complementing EU type-approval legislation with regard to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom (   1   ) from the EU   what is the aim of this regulation  It establishes new rules to ensure a smooth transition for the type-approval  *  of motor vehicles, as well as of systems, components and separate technical units intended for these vehicles, when the UK (   1   ) leaves the EU.   key points    Legal context    Under EU law, the approval of a vehicle type in one EU country is valid EU-wide without the need for further tests and re-certification in other EU countries.   After the UK's withdrawal from the EU (or at the end of the transition period, if the Withdrawal Agreement is ratified), the UK (   1   ) type-approval authority will no longer be a national authority of an EU country.   Therefore, without agreement on a new relationship between the two parties, it will no longer be possible for manufacturers to place vehicles on the market of the 27 remaining EU countries (EU-27) on the basis of type-approvals granted in the UK (   1   ).    EU-27 type-approval    Manufacturers can apply to an EU-27 type-approval authority for types previously approved by the UK (   1   ) authority.   Manufacturers must:   pay fees to the EU type-approval authority for carrying out its functions and duties;   provide documentation and information to the EU authority if requested.      Conditions for approval    The type must comply with the  rules  for the placing on the market, registration or entry into service of new vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units applicable when the EU type-approval takes effect.   Approval may be granted on the basis of the same test reports used for the granting of the UK (   1   ) type-approval in accordance with the applicable rules, regardless of whether the technical service that issued the test report has been designated and notified by the EU country granting the EU type-approval.   The EU authority can request the repetition of specific tests. These must be carried by a technical service designated and notified by that authority.   EU type-approval takes effect on the day it is granted granting unless otherwise stated. The UK (   1   ) type-approval becomes invalid on the day preceding that on which EU type-approval takes effect.   In any event, UK (   1   ) type-approval will become invalid at the latest on the day on which the EU type-approval legislation ceases to apply to and in the UK (   1   ).      EU type-approval authority    From the time that the EU type-approval takes effect, the EU authority in question is responsible for vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units manufactured on the basis of the UK (   1   ) type-approval and placed or to be placed on the market, registered or put into service in the EU.   The manufacturer must also request that the EU authority in question takes over the obligations of the UK (   1   ) type-approval authority concerning the manufacturer's other vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units placed on the market, registered or entered into service in the EU on the basis of UK (   1   ) type-approvals that have either become  invalid  , or for which  no EU type-approval  is sought under this regulation.   This request must be made for all vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units based on UK (   1   ) type-approvals held by the manufacturer that were granted after 1 January 2008 unless the manufacturer can provide proof of an agreement with another EU type-approval authority covering those vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units.   The EU authority is not responsible for any acts or omissions of the UK (   1   ) authority.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 13 January 2019.   background    The EU has adopted specific type-approval and market surveillance rules for  agricultural and forestry vehicles  , as well as for  2 and 3 wheel vehicles and quadracycles  .   key terms    Type-approval:  the procedure whereby an approval authority certifies that a type of vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit satisfies certain legal requirements.
summary of   Directive 2000/31/EC – electronic commerce in the EU   summary    what does the directive do  It establishes  standard rules  in the EU on various issues related to electronic commerce.   key points   Online services covered by the Directive include:        —     news services (such as news websites)            —     selling (books, financial services, travel services, etc.)            —     advertising            —     professional services (lawyers, doctors, estate agents)            —     entertainment services            —     basic intermediary services (internet access, transmission and hosting of information)            —     free services funded by advertising, sponsorship, etc.      The Directive establishes the principle that operators of these services are subject to regulation (related to the taking up and pursuit of the services) only in the EU country where they have their  registered headquarters  – not in the country where the servers, email addresses or postboxes they use are located.  National governments must ensure that operators  publish basic information  on their activities (name, address, trade register number etc.) in a permanent and easily accessible form.   Advertising   National governments must ensure that advertising follows certain rules:        —     it is clearly identifiable as advertising            —     the person or company responsible for it is clearly identifiable            —     promotional offers, games or competitions are clearly identifiable, and the conditions are easily accessible and presented in clear and simple terms.       Spam   Unrequested e-mail (‘spam’) must also be clearly identifiable. Companies who send out spam emails must regularly consult and respect ‘opt-out registers’, to which people who do not wish to receive such emails can sign up.   Online contracts   In every EU country, electronic contracts must be given  equivalent legal status  to paper contracts.  These contracts must also spell out the following, in  clear and understandable  terms:        —     the technical steps consumers must follow to conclude the contract            —     whether or not the contract will be filed by the service provider and whether consumers can view it at a later stage            —     how consumers can identify and correct typing errors before placing their order            —     the languages in which the contract can be signed.      Consumers must be able to  save  and  print out  contracts and general conditions.  See also  Directive 2011/83/EU  on consumer rights.   Online orders   These are bound by the following requirements:        —     the service provider must confirm receipt of the order without undue delay and electronically (email, other electronic message)            —     the order (or receipt confirmation) is considered to have been received when the seller (consumer) is able to access it.      See also  Regulation (EU) 910/2014  on electronic identification and trust services.   Enforcing existing legislation   The Directive encourages both self-regulation by operators and co-regulatory efforts with governments. Examples include :        —     codes of conduct at EU level            —     online systems for settling disputes out of court, especially when the seller and buyer are in different countries.      EU countries must also provide fast, efficient solutions to legal problems in the online environment and ensure penalties are effective, proportionate and dissuasive.   Liability of service providers   Online service providers who act as mere conduit, caching or hosting services providers are not responsible for the  information they transmit or host  if they fulfil certain conditions. In the case of hosting service providers, they are exempted from liability as long as:        —     they do not have actual knowledge of illegal activity or information and,            —     if they obtain such knowledge or awareness, they act at once to remove or to disable access to the information      National governments cannot impose any general monitoring obligation on these ‘intermediaries’ over the information they send or store, to look for and prevent illegal activity.   background    E-commerce directive   act   Directive  2000/31/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market (‘Directive on electronic commerce’)   REFERENCES           Act     Entry into force     Deadline for transposition in the Member States     Official Journal       Directive  2000/31/EC      17.7.2000     16.1.2002      OJ L 178, 17.7.2000, pp. 1–16
summary of   Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA — protection of personal data processed in the context of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters   what is the aim of this framework decision  It aims to protect people’s fundamental rights and freedoms when their personal data are processed for the purposes of preventing, investigating, detecting or prosecuting a criminal offence or of executing a criminal penalty.   key points    Scope    This framework decision concerns both personal data that are processed in part or entirely by automatic means (using information technology) and personal data that are part of a filing system and processed by non-automatic means (i.e. humans).    Data processing    The competent authorities of European Union (EU) countries may collect personal data only for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes. The processing of these data is permitted only for the purposes for which they were collected. Processing for other purposes is allowed only under certain circumstances or when certain appropriate safeguards are in place (e.g. such as making the data anonymous).   In principle, personal data that reveals a person’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership or concerns his/her health or sex life may not be processed. Their processing may be allowed only if it is absolutely necessary and if appropriate safeguards have been established.   Inaccurate personal data must be rectified and updated or completed if possible. Once the data are no longer needed for the purposes they were collected, they must be erased, made anonymous or, in certain cases, blocked. The need to store personal data must be reviewed regularly, with time limits set for their erasure.   EU countries’ competent authorities must verify that the personal data to be transmitted or made available are accurate, up to date and complete. In order to be able to verify that the processing of data is lawful and to ensure the integrity and security of the data, their transmissions must be logged or documented.    Data transmission    Personal data received from another EU country are to be processed only for the purposes for which they were transmitted. In certain cases, however, they may be processed for other purposes, for example for the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of other criminal offences, the execution of other criminal penalties or the prevention of threats to public security. The receiving EU country must respect any specific restrictions to the exchanges of data provided for in the law of the transmitting country.   Under certain circumstances, the receiving EU country may transfer personal data to non-EU countries or to international bodies. To this end, the EU country that first made the data available must provide its consent. Only in urgent cases may data be transferred without prior consent. Personal data may also be transferred to private parties in EU countries for exclusive purposes, provided that the competent authority of the country from where the data was received has given its consent.    Rights of data subjects    The data subject is to be kept informed of any collection or processing of personal data relating to him/her. However, when data have been transmitted from one EU country to another, the first may demand that the second does not divulge any information to the subject.   The data subject may request to receive a confirmation on   whether their data have been transmitted,   who the recipients are, what data are being processed, as well as a   confirmation that the necessary verifications of that data have been made.     In certain cases, EU countries may restrict the subject’s access to information. Any decision restricting access must be given in writing to the data subject, together with the factual and legal reasons thereof. The data subject must also be given advice on their right to appeal such a decision.   The data subject may demand that personal data relating to him/her be rectified, erased or blocked. Any refusal to that end must be given in writing, along with information on the right to lodge a complaint or seek a judicial remedy.   Any person may demand compensation for the damages they have suffered due to an unlawful processing of personal data or any other act that is not compatible with this framework decision. Where a data subject’s rights are breached, they have the right to a judicial remedy.    Safeguarding data processing    The competent authorities must take the necessary security measures to protect personal data against any unlawful form of processing. This includes accidental loss, alteration and unauthorised disclosure of, as well as access to, personal data.

summary of   Recommendation 2001/613/EC on mobility within the EU for students, persons undergoing training, volunteers, teachers and trainers   what is the aim of the recommendation  Following the  European Council  in Lisbon in 2000, this recommendation aims to support free movement in the field of education and training. It calls on European Union (EU) countries to take the necessary steps to encourage the mobility of students, teachers and training staff within the EU.   key points   The recommendation calls for EU countries to remove legal, administrative, linguistic and cultural obstacles to people:   studying or undergoing training;   volunteering; or   teaching or providing training;   in another EU country.  Among the issues, aims and suggestions put forward are:   the goal of learning at least 2 EU languages, with linguistic and cultural preparation before travel;   encouraging awareness of EU citizenship in young people, as well as respect for differences;   easy access to information about opportunities in other EU countries;   financial support (grants, scholarships, subsidies, loans, etc.) to be facilitated and simplified;   assistance with transport costs, accommodation, meals and access to cultural resources on the same basis as host country citizens; and   better awareness of financial entitlements and reciprocal social security cover.    Measures which specifically affectstudents or those undergoing training    encourage students to complete a part of their studies in another EU country and facilitate the academic recognition of periods of study completed between countries;   encourage clearer models for training certificates, for example by providing translations and centralised information points;   enable students to show more easily that they have health cover or financial resources to obtain residence permits; and   facilitate the integration and support of students within the education system of the host country, as well as their reintegration in their home country.    Measures affecting young volunteers    ensure that the specific nature of voluntary activity is considered in legal and administrative issues;   promote the introduction of a certificate of participation with a view to a common EU format for job applications; and   avoid discrimination against volunteers in entitlement to social protection.    Measures which concern teachers and trainers    consider problems faced in mobility resulting from some national legislation and encourage cooperation;   temporary replacement of teachers and trainers on mobility;   facilitate integration in the host establishment;   introduce European training periods to make mobility easier;   encourage a European dimension in the profession through the content of training programmes, and through contact and exchanges between establishments; and   promote European mobility experience as a career component.   EU countries are asked to draw up a report every 2 years on the action taken in response to these recommendations.   background   The recommendations outlined applied originally to EU programmes such as Socrates (education), Leonardo da Vinci (vocational training) and Youth, all of which are now part of the  Erasmus+  programme, and complement measures that now fall under  ET 2020  which covers cooperation in education, training and lifelong learning.
   Placing of pyrotechnic articles on the market     Placing of pyrotechnic articles on the market     With a view to ensuring the free movement of pyrotechnic articles*, this Directive creates a legislative framework at Community level, introducing minimum safety requirements for such articles. It also harmonises the provision of information on the safe handling and use of pyrotechnic articles.     ACT     Directive       2007/23/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 May 2007 on the placing on the market of pyrotechnic articles.     SUMMARY     The purpose of this Directive is to ensure the free movement of pyrotechnic articles. In order to protect human health and guarantee the safety of consumers and professional users, it sets out the essential safety requirements which pyrotechnic articles must meet before they are placed on the market.      Categorisation and age limits      There are three types of pyrotechnic article: fireworks, theatrical pyrotechnic articles and other pyrotechnic articles. Each type of pyrotechnic article must be categorised by the manufacturer according to its type of use, purpose or noise level. 4. This Directive stipulates that pyrotechnic articles must not be sold or made otherwise available to consumers below specified age limits.      Placing on the market, free movement and “CE” marking      The Member States must ensure that pyrotechnic articles cannot be placed on the market unless they satisfy the requirements of this Directive, they bear the “CE” marking and they comply with the obligations regarding conformity assessment.     The Member States may not prohibit, restrict or hinder the placing on the market of pyrotechnic articles which fall within the scope of this Directive and which satisfy its requirements. The provisions of the Directive do not preclude a Member State from taking measures which are justified on grounds of public security or safety to restrict the use and/or the sale of high-risk fireworks to the general public.     Upon completion of the conformity assessment, the “       CE      ” marking must be affixed on the pyrotechnic articles by the manufacturer.      Labelling      Pyrotechnic articles must be properly labelled in the official language(s) of the country in which they are sold.     The labelling must state, as a minimum:      the name and address of the manufacturer and the name of the importer, where the manufacturer is not established in the Community;       the designation and type of the pyrotechnic article;       the age limits;       the relevant category;       the instructions for use;       the safety distance to be observed;       the quantity of active explosive material.      Other information must be displayed on the articles, depending on their type and category.     Pyrotechnic articles for vehicles are subject to special rules on labelling.      Market surveillance      The Member States must take steps to ensure that pyrotechnic articles may be placed on the market only if they do not endanger people’s health and safety. For example, they must carry out regular inspections of pyrotechnic articles on entry into the Community.     Where a Member State believes that a product presents a serious risk, it must quickly inform the Commission and the other Member States and perform an evaluation of the product.     A safeguard clause procedure allows a Member State to contest the provisional measures taken by another Member State to withdraw an article from the market or to restrict its free movement.      Conformity assessment      To ensure that pyrotechnic articles comply with the essential safety requirements, the manufacturer must follow a conformity assessment procedure. Harmonised standards for the design, manufacture and testing of pyrotechnic articles are developed by the European standardisation bodies, such as the Committee for European Standardisation (CEN).     The Member States appoint authorised bodies, known as 'notified bodies', to carry out the conformity assessment procedures.      Obligations of the manufacturer, importer and distributor      Manufacturers must ensure that pyrotechnic articles meet the essential safety requirements. They have to submit the articles to a notified body, which will perform a conformity assessment procedure. If the article meets the requirements of this Directive, the notified body will issue a certificate of conformity to the manufacturer, who will affix the "CE" marking to the article.     If the manufacturer is not established in the Community, the importer must ensure that the product meets the requirements of this Directive.     Finally, distributors also have obligations: they must verify that the article bears the conformity markings and is accompanied by the required documents.       Key terms of the act         Pyrotechnic article: any article containing explosive substances or an explosive mixture of substances designed to produce heat, light, sound, gas or smoke or a combination of such effects through self-sustained exothermic chemical reactions.

This Directive seeks to harmonise the Member States’ laws relating to       explosives for civil uses      . It excludes pyrotechnic articles from its scope.      Commission Directive         2004/57/EC        of 23 April 2004 on the identification of pyrotechnic articles and certain ammunition for the purposes of Council Directive         93/15/EEC        on the harmonisation of the provisions relating to the placing on the market and supervision of explosives for civil uses [Official Journal L 127 of 29.04.2004].      Directive       93/15/EEC      does not apply to pyrotechnic articles but to explosives for civil uses. Certain products, however, have a dual function, since it is possible to use them either as explosives or as pyrotechnic articles. In order to ensure consistent application of Directive       93/15/EEC      , this Directive identifies the products in question in terms of their predominant character.

This Directive lays down Community standards governing safety in the performance of       marine equipment      on board ships. Directive       2007/23/EC      does not apply to the pyrotechnic articles covered by Directive       96/98/EC      .

Following on from the first Seveso Directive of 1982, the Seveso II Directive is intended to prevent major accidents involving       dangerous substances      and to limit their consequences for man and the environment. This Directive sets out safety requirements for establishments where explosives, including pyrotechnic substances, are present.      Council Directive         88/378/EEC        of 3 May 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning the safety of toys [Official Journal L 187 of 16.07.1988].      This Directive sets out the safety criteria with which       toys      must comply when they are manufactured and before they are placed on the European market. Percussion caps intended specifically for toys (for example, caps for toy guns) fall within the scope of Council Directive       88/378/EEC      and therefore do not fall within the scope of Directive       2007/23/EC      on pyrotechnic articles.

   'Drug prevention and information' programme (2007-2013)     'Drug prevention and information' programme (2007-2013)     The European Union (EU) establishes the 'Drug prevention and information' programme for the period 1.1.2007 - 31.12.2013 is part of the General Programme 'Fundamental Rights and Justice'. It aims to support projects aimed at preventing drug use.     ACT     Decision       1150/2007/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 September establishing for the period 2007-2013 the specific programme 'Drug prevention and information' as part of the General Programme 'Fundamental Rights and Justice'.     SUMMARY     The death rate from drug addiction in Europe is very high. It is essential to measure the immediate and long-term consequences of drug use on health and social and psychological development, and the equality of the chances of the individuals concerned.     The 'Drug prevention and information' programme set up by the European Union has three objectives. Specifically to:       prevent and reduce        drug use, drug addiction and the associated inherent risks;        improve information        about drug use;        support        the implementation of the         EU Drugs Strategy        .      To this end, the programme       supports transnational actions      aimed at:      creating multi-disciplinary networks;       ensuring the expansion of the knowledge base, as well as the exchange of information and good practices;       raising awareness of the health and social problems caused by drug use;       preventing drug use.       Scope      The actions financed by this programme are:      the actions implemented by the Commission (research, surveys, conferences, campaigns, public events, analysis, Internet sites, etc.);       transnational projects of European interest presented by Member States or by candidate countries for membership of the EU;       the activities of non-governmental organisations and other bodies pursuing aims of general European interest.      The actions developed under this programme are open to       public or private      bodies, active in terms of preventing, or providing information, on drug use.     The programme is targeted at all groups implicated in drug use, but most particularly at ‘       at risk groups’      such as young people, women, vulnerable groups and people living in socially disadvantaged areas.     Other targeted groups include educational staff, parents, teachers, social workers, local and national authorities, medical and paramedical personnel, judicial staff, law enforcement and penitentiary authorities, non-governmental organisations, trade unions and religious communities.      Financing      The programme has a budget for 2007-2013 of EUR 21.35 million. Grants are awarded by the Commission following calls for proposals, taking into account:      the conformity of the proposed action with the annual work programme;       the consistency of the expected results with the programme objectives;       the sum asked for and whether it is appropriate to the expected results;       the geographical and social impact of the action and its likely effect on the public;       citizen involvement in the organisation of the bodies concerned.       Context      The EU has launched a number of initiatives in its fight against drugs. In addition to the       EU Drugs Strategy      for the period 2005-2012, an       Action Plan      was adopted in order to translate the strategy into concrete actions.     The 'Drug prevention and information' programme forms part of the general programme ‘Fundamental Rights and Justice’ 2007-2013 aimed at promoting freedom, security and justice in the EU. The latter also includes the       Criminal Justice      ,       Civil Justice      , and       Fundamental Rights and Citizenship      specific programmes, and the       Daphne III      programme on combating violence.

The evaluation of the programme shows that it has recorded good results during the first three years of implementation and that several objectives have been achieved. The Commission regrets, however, the insufficient budget it has at its disposal and which prevents the programme from having a real effect at European level. It therefore proposes to increase the financial resources of the programme, and also to prioritise projects with a European dimension, to simplify the administrative procedures and to improve the dissemination of the results obtained.

   The IDABC Programme (2005-2009)     The IDABC Programme (2005-2009)     The IDABC programme (       Interoperable Delivery of Pan-European eGovernment Services to Public Administrations, Business and Citizens      ) aims to deliver the services its title suggests. The goal is to improve the effectiveness of European public administrations and cooperation between them.     ACT     Decision       2004/387/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on the interoperable delivery of pan-European eGovernment services to public administrations, businesses and citizens (IDABC) [Official Journal L 144 of 30 April 2004].     SUMMARY     IDABC is an eGovernment programme for the period 2005-2009.     It succeeds the       Interchange of Data between Administrations programme      (IDA), with a broader scope. It covers the objectives of the IDA programme but also aims to create pan-European eGovernment services for businesses and citizens.     IDABC forms part of the       eEurope 2005      and       i2010 initiatives      Interoperability       *      and open standards remain priority areas, and are joined by the new pan-European services to be set up.      Objectives      The IDABC programme aims to support and promote the development of pan-European eGovernment services       *      and the underlying interoperable telematic networks.     The programme also aims to:      enable the interchange of information between public administrations, as well as between such administrations and the Community institutions;       facilitate the delivery of pan-European services to businesses and citizens taking account of their needs;       achieve interoperability across different policy areas, notably on the basis of a European Interoperability Framework;       promote the spread of good practice and encourage the development of innovative telematic solutions in public administrations.       Projects of common interest and horizontal measures      The IDABC programme includes projects of common interest to help implement Community legislation and improve interinstitutional cooperation.     The programme also contains horizontal measures which aim to establish horizontal pan-European eGovernment and infrastructure services, particularly those promoting interoperability.      Implementation principles      The implementation of projects of common interest and horizontal measures should follow a certain number of principles, such that they:      are founded on a sectoral legal basis (for projects of common interest);       involve as many Member States as possible;       include, whenever appropriate, a preparatory phase and comprise a feasibility phase, a development and validation phase, and an implementation phase;       take other Community programmes into account to avoid duplication. These may be         research and technological development programmes        , or the         eTen        ,         eContent        , eInclusion and         eLearning        programmes;       take account of the European interoperability framework provided by the IDABC programme;       make use of horizontal pan-European eGovernment and infrastructure services whenever possible (for projects of common interest);       carry out a post-implementation review of projects and measures within one year of the end of the implementation phase.       Implementation procedure      The Commission must establish a rolling       work programme      for the whole period covered by this Decision for the implementation of projects of common interest and horizontal measures.      Community financial contribution      Concerning the implementation of projects of common interest and horizontal measures, the Community bears costs in proportion to its interest.     For a project of common interest or a horizontal measure to receive a financial contribution from the Community, concrete plans for financing the maintenance and operational costs of the post-implementation phase are required. In the preparatory and feasibility phases, the Community contribution may cover the full cost of the necessary studies.     In the development, validation and implementation phases, the Community bears the cost of those tasks that are assigned to it in the global implementation plan of that project of common interest or horizontal measure.      International cooperation      The countries of the European Economic Area and candidate countries may participate in the IDABC programme within the framework of their respective agreements with the Community. Cooperation with other third countries is encouraged, notably with public administrations in Mediterranean countries, the Balkans and Eastern European countries.      Financial framework      The financial framework for the IDABC programme is set at EUR 148.7 million for the period from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2009.       Key terms used in the act         Pan-European eGovernment services: cross-border public sector information and interactive services provided by European public administrations to European public administrations, businesses and citizens, by means of interoperable trans-European telematic networks.         Interoperability: the ability of information and communication technology systems to exchange data and to enable information and knowledge to be shared.

This Communication publishes the results of the final evaluation of the implementation of the IDABC programme. The evaluation focussed on aspects such as the relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, utility, sustainability and coherence of the programme.     The conclusions were largely positive, even though the programme was delayed in 2005. The IDABC programme fulfilled most of the objectives in the area of eGovernment detailed in the i2010 strategy.     The ISA programme will follow on from the IDABC programme. The actions implemented under the framework of this future programme will principally cover:      the strategic environment in which the programme should operate;       the stakeholder communication tools;       the development of monitoring methods.      The future ISA programme will pursue the communication efforts of the IDABC programme.      Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council of 24 October 2006 - Evaluation of the implementation of the IDABC programme [         COM(2006) 611        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      This communication reports the conclusions and recommendations resulting from the mid-term evaluation of the programme.     The evaluation, which was largely positive, emphasised the relevance and utility of the IDABC programme. The stakeholders consulted feel that it contributes real value-added to the online supply of administration services. But the programme is still at an early stage of its implementation, and it is not yet possible to present an analysis of its implications in the Community or measure its effectiveness.     However, the evaluation has highlighted a few shortcomings which need to be considered in the further implementation of the programme. Accordingly, a number of recommendations have been drawn up, including:      ensure that all players know their part in the implementation process;       step up efforts to gather and disseminate specific and up-to-date information about users’ needs;       carry out an appraisal of the links between the various EU programmes within which the Community develops interoperable eGovernment initiatives.

act   Council Directive  98/49/EC  of 29 June 1998 on safeguarding the supplementary pension rights of employed and self-employed persons moving within the Community.   summary   This Directive applies to members of supplementary pension schemes and others holding entitlement under such schemes who have acquired or are in the process of acquiring rights in one or more Member States.  This Directive provides for four main measures to safeguard the supplementary pension rights of workers moving within the Community:   Equality of treatment as regards preservation of pension rights   Member States must, for persons who have left a supplementary pension scheme as a consequence of going to work in another Member State, take the necessary measures to ensure the preservation of vested pension rights to the same extent as for persons in respect of whom contributions are no longer being made but who remain within the same Member State.   Directive 2014/50/EU  , which must be incorporated in EU countries' national laws by 21.5.2018, ensures that anyone with supplementary pension rights does not lose out when they go to live or work in another EU country. It requires that:   supplementary pension rights be  guaranteed  after 3 years of employment at the latest. If a minimum age is required, it must not be higher than 21 years;   the rights of workers who leave an occupational pension scheme before retirement be  preserved  and treated like those who remain in the scheme on matters such as indexation.    Cross-border payments   Member States shall ensure that supplementary pension schemes make payment in other Member States, net of any taxes and transaction charges, of all benefits due under these supplementary schemes.   Posted workers and supplementary pensions   Posted workers have the option of remaining within the pension scheme in their country of origin during the period of posting in another Member State. Posted workers and, where applicable, their employers are thus exempted from any obligation to make contributions to a supplementary pension scheme in another Member State.   Information to scheme members   Employers, trustees or others responsible for the management of supplementary pension schemes shall provide adequate information to scheme members, when they move to another Member State, as to their pension rights and the choices which are available to them under the scheme.  Under Directive 2014/50/EU, workers in a supplementary pension scheme can ask how stopping employment or moving would affect their supplementary pension rights and the conditions that would apply to the future treatment of those rights.  People who have left the scheme must be informed about the value and treatment of their rights.

summary of   Decision No 70/2008/EC replacing paper-format customs procedures with EU-wide electronic ones   what is the aim of the decision  It aims to promote  electronic customs (e-customs)  in the  European Commission  . Such systems facilitate trade by reducing costs and coordinating procedures. They also permit the exchange of data between the customs administrations of EU countries, traders and the Commission. In this way, they improve and facilitate supply chain logistics and customs processes.   key points   Following on from the 2003  communication on creating a simple and paperless environment for customs and trade  , it was agreed under this decision that the Commission and the EU countries would set up:   secure;   integrated;   interoperable; and   accessible e-customs systems for the exchange of   data contained in customs declarations   documents accompanying customs declarations and certificates and   other relevant information.     The Commission and the EU countries are to establish the structure and means for the operation of those e-customs systems.   Measures   To meet the objectives set out in the decision, the EU needs to:   harmonise the exchange of information;   review customs processes with a view to optimising their efficiency and effectiveness;   offer traders a wide range of e-customs services.    The Commission’s role   The  Commission  must coordinate:   the setting-up, testing, operation and maintenance of the EU components of the computerised systems;   the systems and services set out in this proposal with other projects concerning e-government services;   the parallel development of national and EU elements;   automatic customs services and single-window services  *  at EU level;   the completion of the tasks allocated to it under a multiannual strategic plan;   training needs.   The Commission must also monitor progress with regard to the Customs Policy Group. It must also initiate  regular consultations  with the economic stakeholders concerned.

   Community participation in the initiative to ease the debt burden of highly-indebted poor countries (HIPC)     Community participation in the initiative to ease the debt burden of highly-indebted poor countries (HIPC)     This communication sets out the Community's contribution to the world debt relief initiative for highly indebted poor countries (HIPC).     ACT     Commission Communication of 26 October 1999 on Community participation in the debt relief initiative for highly indebted poor countries (HIPC) [       COM(99)518      final. Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY      Background      This initiative comes under the framework of the global initiative to help highly indebted poor countries (HIPC) launched by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank in September 1996. It represents a coordinated effort by all the donors, in particular multilateral creditors, and it aims to relieve the debt of the poorest countries. For the first time, a close link has been stressed between poverty alleviation strategies, structural adjustment programs and the debt relief initiative.     At the Cologne G7 summit in July 1999, ministers agreed to an expanded initiative that would provide faster, more comprehensive and broader debt relief. The total cost of the initiative was estimated at around US$ 61 billion at net present value in 2004. This initiative, which was initially to be for a two-year period, has been extended four times (in 1998, 2000, 2002 and 2004).      Eligible countries      The initiative covers the poorest countries that are making concerted efforts to adjust and are committed to fighting poverty. It covers, in particular, those poorest countries which are already receiving supplementary assistance from the World Bank and the IMF, and whose debt burdens are deemed to be unsustainable after all other debt relief measures have been applied. Certain ACP countries are among the countries concerned.      Role of the European Community      As a major partner of developing countries, the Community has a key role to play, especially given the new high total cost of the initiative. The resources granted from the interest accrued on EDF funds, as provided for by Decision       98/453/EC      of July 1998 concerning exceptional assistance for the heavily indebted ACP countries, will not be sufficient to cover the financing of the new enhanced initiative.     The Commission has indicated that it is prepared to use funds in the framework of existing       European Development Fund      (EDF) instruments for the purpose of making a substantial contribution towards alleviating the debt burden of ACP States which are eligible for the HIPC initiative. So far the Community has allocated over EUR 1.6 billion to the initiative, to which it is contributing both as a creditor and as a donor, particularly for the ACP countries. EDF resources are used only for eligible ACP countries. A contribution of EUR 54 million from the budget has been made for the Asian and Latin American countries.      Role of the Community as a creditor      The Community mainly supports development through non-refundable grants. It is therefore only a small multilateral creditor. According to the most recent estimates, it accounts for only about 2% of the total cost of the HIPC initiative. As a creditor, the cost of the Community contribution so far has been estimated as EUR 680 million. The resources granted are allocated mainly out of EDF interest and intra-ACP reserves.      Role of the Community as a donor      Over and above the Community's contribution as a creditor, it is participating in the initiative as a donor. Unallocated resources from the 8th EDF and previous EDFs have been the main source of funds for the EU's contribution as a donor. As a donor, the Community has so far allocated EUR 934 million to the HIPP Trust Fund managed by the World Bank.      Additional participation      As a key partner of the developing countries, the Commission considers that the Community should make an additional contribution. In 2001 the Council approved an additional contribution of EUR 60 million, which will enable early repayment in full of the special loans to the least developed ACP countries eligible for the HIPP initiative.

summary   As the EU bank, the  European Investment Bank  (EIB) provides finance and expertise for sound and sustainable investment projects in Europe and beyond. Owned by the 28 EU countries, the projects it supports contribute to furthering EU policy objectives. The bank’s priorities going forward are reflected in the  corporate operational plan 2015-2017  .   what does the operational plan 2015-2017 do  Approved in April 2015, it details how the EIB plans to best use its resources to fund projects, including support provided under the  investment plan for Europe  , expected to be underwritten by an additional guarantee from the EU budget.   key points    Investing to restore EU competitiveness   The EIB remains well placed to support investment growth, reinforce economic and social cohesion, sustain employment and play a critical role in restoring EU competitiveness.  It continues to be very responsive to the economic environment and prove its role as the EU bank. This was underlined with the €10 billion capital increase approved in 2012. This enables additional financing of viable investment projects in the range of €180 billion between 2013 and 2015 across the EU, with a focus on projects aiming at sustainable long-term growth and employment. The EIB is on track to deliver, and even exceed, these objectives and intends to continue in its important catalytic role to resolve the EU’s current investment and competitiveness challenges.  The EIB plans to maintain significant lending volumes throughout the 2015-2017 period, including sizeable anti-cyclical contributions to support investment activities in the EU.  Outside the EU, the bank will stay firmly engaged to support EU policy and continue to promote private sector-led growth, both by supporting access to finance for SMEs and much needed economic and social infrastructure and by providing advice and technical assistance.   A strategic partnership between the EIB and the European Commission   The  European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI)  is a strategic partnership between the European Commission and the EIB, deployed by the EIB Group (EIB and  European Investment Fund — EIF  ), to address market failure by helping reduce the risk inherent in projects to encourage further investment.  The EIB will contribute €5 billion to the new initiative, alongside a €16 billion guarantee from the EU budget. This will allow EFSI to unlock additional investment of at least €315 billion over the 2015-2017 period.   The value of lending   The EIB lends to public sector bodies and private companies. To receive support the project must further EU objectives and be economically, technically, financially and environmentally sound.   background   Created in 1958, the EIB is the EU bank for long-term loans. In 1994, the EIF was set up to support the development of high-growth small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and/or those active in new technologies. The EIB is the majority shareholder and operator of the EIF. In 2000, the EIB Group was created, consisting of the EIB and the EIF. Within the Group, the EIB grants medium and long-term bank loans, while the EIF specialises in venture-capital operations and providing guarantees for SMEs.        —      European Investment Bank             —      European Investment Fund             —      Investment Plan for Europe       act   European Investment Bank Group:  operational plan 2015-2017  , 8 May 2015
   Croatia – Education and culture     Croatia – Education and culture     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM(2010) 660      final – SEC(2010) 1326 - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     In its       2010 Report      , the Commission regrets that Croatia has not made additional progress in the areas of education, training, youth and culture. However, the country has achieved an adequate level of alignment and future effort should essentially focus on preparing the country to participate in European Union programmes.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission's words)      Education, training and youth is primarily the competence of the Member States. The EC Treaty provides that the Community will contribute to the development of quality education and implement a vocational training policy that supports and supplements the action of Member States. The       acquis      consists of a directive on education of the children of migrant workers, and of action programmes and recommendations. Member States need to have the necessary implementing capacity in place to effectively participate in the Community programmes related to this chapter.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission's words)      Further progress has been made regarding the       acquis      in the area of       education and culture      . There is a good level of alignment.     Croatia needs to continue its efforts to prepare for the       management of the Lifelong Learning and Youth in Action Programmes      .     RELATED ACTS      Commission Report [         COM(2009) 533        final – SEC(2009) 1333 final – Not published in the Official Journal].      The October 2009 report noted that Croatia had made good progress, in particular in aligning with the Community       acquis      as well as in partially meeting its Accession Partnership priorities. Nevertheless, additional efforts were needed with regard to the management of Community programmes and adult education.      Commission Report [         COM(2008) 674        final – SEC(2008) 2694 final – Not published in the Official Journal].      The November 2008 report noted encouraging progress with regard to respect for the Accession Partnership priorities in the field of education, training and youth. Preparations for the management of the programmes were to be continued.      Commission Report [         COM(2007) 663        final – SEC(2007) 1431 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The November 2007 report noted the continuation of the education reform process and Croatia’s good level of alignment with the       acquis      . Efforts remained to be made regarding non-discrimination between EU and Croatian nationals in secondary education and the application of the directive on education of children of migrant workers.      Commission Report [         COM(2006) 649        final – SEC(2006) 1385 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The November 2006 report noted that Croatia had made reasonable progress, particularly in continuing with its reforms, and had achieved a good level of preparation for implementing the       acquis      . However, it had to put in place the management capacity and infrastructure needed to manage the Community programmes in which it participates. It also had to continue its efforts to guarantee non-discrimination between EU and Croatian nationals.      Commission Report [         COM(2005) 561        final - SEC(2005) 1424 - Not published in the Official Journal].      The October 2005 report noted that several measures had been taken in connection with the reform of the education and training system, particularly in the area of higher education with the introduction of the Bologna process in study programmes. Croatia’s system of vocational education and training needed substantial improvement. It needed to be based on a coherent national policy approach and pay greater heed to youth policy.      Commission Opinion [         COM(2004) 257        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      In its opinion of April 2004, the European Commission concluded that Croatia should not encounter any major problems in the field of education and training in the medium term. It would, however, have to make a considerable effort to create a modern vocational education and training system in line with the European Union’s (EU) employment and social policies.

summary of   Council Directive 91/383/EEC of 25 June 1991 supplementing the measures to improve health and safety in the workplace of temporary workers   what is the aim of this directive  It aims to ensure that EU countries enact legislation to improve health and safety protection for workers on temporary  *  or fixed-term  *  contracts, to bring it in line with the protection enjoyed by other workers.   key points    Council Directive 89/391/EEC  on the safety and health of workers applies equally to temporary workers  *  . The current directive supplements this with the following:   Information and training    Before work begins, temporary workers should be informed of any risks in the job and, in particular, any special occupational qualifications, skills or special medical surveillance required.   Each worker should receive sufficient job-appropriate training adapted to their level of qualifications and experience.    Special medical surveillance   Where work is particularly dangerous to the safety or health of temporary workers, or requires special medical surveillance, EU countries have the option to prohibit their use. If temporary workers are used for such work, appropriate special medical surveillance must be provided by the employer, which could extend beyond the period of employment, if necessary.   Health and safetyservices   Health and safety services within an organisation must be informed of any assignment of temporary workers.   Employment businesses and agencies    If temporary workers are supplied by an agency, or other employment business, the agency must be informed of the qualifications required and the specific features of the work, and this information must be passed on to the workers concerned. The information could form part of the contract of assignment.   The organisation employing the temporary worker, however, is responsible for the safety, hygiene and health aspects of working conditions.    Responsibility of EU countries   EU countries must report to the  European Commission  every 5 years on its implementation, including the points of view of workers and employers.   from when does the directive apply  It applies from 15 July 1991. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 31 December 1992.   background   For more information, see:    Working Conditions — Health and Safety in Fixed-Term and Temporary Employment  on the European Commission’s website    Directive 91/383/EEC — fixed-duration or temporary employment relationship  on the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work's website    Summary  of Council Directive 89/391/EEC on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work.   * key terms     Temporary contract:  an employment contract between a temporary employment business (such as an agency) and a worker, to carry out a task in an organisation under its supervision.     Fixed-term (or fixed-duration) contract:  an employment contract directly between an employer and a worker for a specific duration or to complete a specific task.     Temporary worker:  a term used for clarity in this summary to cover a person working under either of the 2 temporary employment relationships defined above.
   Turkey - Internal market     Turkey - Internal market     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM(2011) 666      final – SEC(2011) 1201 – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The       2011 Report      notes limited progress concerning the free movement of goods, although alignment of the legislation with the       acquis      has progressed well. With regard to the freedom of movement for workers, no progress is noted, although the area of public procurement shows limited progress. In the area of company law, satisfactory advancements can be identified, specifically the adoption of a new Commercial Code. The application of legislation on intellectual property remains weak.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission’s words)      The principle of the       free movement of goods      implies that products must be traded freely from one part of the Union to another. In a number of sectors, this general principle is complemented by a harmonised regulatory framework, following the "old approach" (imposing precise product specifications) or the "new approach" (imposing general product requirements). The harmonised European product legislation, which has to be transposed, represents the largest part of the       acquis      under this chapter. In addition, sufficient administrative capacity to notify the restrictions to trade and to apply horizontal and procedural measures in areas such as standardisation, certification, accreditation, metrology and market surveillance is essential.     The       acquis      in respect of the       free movement of workers      states that citizens of an EU Member State have the right to work in another Member State. EU migrant workers must be treated in the same manner as national workers with regard to working conditions, social benefits and tax allowances. The       acquis      also provides a mechanism for coordinating national social security provisions for those tax contributors and their families who move to another Member State.     Member States are required to remove all restrictions with regard to the       free movement of services      . Member States must ensure that the right of establishment and the freedom to provide services anywhere in the EU is not hampered by national legislation. In some sectors, the       acquis      prescribes harmonised rules which must be respected if the internal market is to function; this concerns mainly the financial sector (banking, insurance, investment services and securities markets). Financial institutions may carry out their activities throughout the European Union according to the principle of ‘home country control’ by opening branches or by providing cross-border services. The       acquis      also provides harmonised rules for some specific professions (craftsmen, traders, farmers, commercial agents), for certain information society services, and matters relating to personal data protection.     Member States must remove all restrictions on the       free movement of capital      between themselves, within the European Union, but also with third countries (with some exceptions) and adopt EU rules applicable to cross-border payments and to credit transfers concerning transferable securities. The money laundering and financing of terrorism directives require banks and other economic operators to identify their clients and be aware of certain operations, particularly in the case of cash transactions for high-value items. In order to tackle financial crime, it is essential that administrative and enforcement capacities are put in place, particularly by establishing cooperation between those authorities responsible for surveillance, implementing law and carrying out criminal proceedings.     The       acquis      on       public procurement      covers the general principles of transparency, equal treatment, free competition and non-discrimination. In addition, specific Community rules apply to the coordination and granting of public works, supplies and services contracts for traditional contracting entities and specific sectors. The       acquis      also defines the rules relating to the court procedures and means of action available. Its implementation requires specialised bodies.     The       acquis      relating to       intellectual property      rights defines the harmonised rules for the legal protection of copyright and related rights. Specific provisions are applicable to the protection of databases, data processing programmes, topographies of semi-conductors, satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission. In the field of intellectual property rights, the       acquis      details harmonised rules for the legal protection of trademarks and designs. Other specific provisions apply to biotechnological inventions and to pharmaceutical and phytopharmaceutical products. The       acquis      also establishes a Community trademark system and a Community design system.     The       acquis      on       company law      includes rules applicable to the constitution, registration, merger and division of companies. In the field of financial information, the       acquis      specifies the rules to be complied with regarding the presentation of consolidated annual accounts and provides simplified rules for small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular. The application of international accounting standards is obligatory for certain entities of public interest. Furthermore, the       acquis      also includes provisions relating to the approval, professional integrity and independence of persons responsible for legal controls.     The       Customs union       acquis      consists almost exclusively of legislation which is directly binding on the Member States. It includes the Community's Customs Code and its implementing provisions; the Combined Nomenclature, Common Customs Tariff and provisions on tariff classification, customs duty relief, duty suspensions and certain tariff quotas; and other provisions such as those on customs control of counterfeit and pirated goods, drugs precursors and the export of cultural goods and on mutual administrative assistance in customs matters and transit. Member States must also have the required implementing capacities, particularly connectivity with the EU’s computerised customs systems. Customs authorities must also have sufficient capacity for implementation and compliance with the specific provisions established in related fields of the       acquis      , such as foreign trade.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      As regards       free movement of goods      , legislative alignment is advanced, but limited progress was made in the reporting period. Technical barriers to trade continue to prevent free movement of goods in breach of Turkey's obligations under the Customs Union.     Hardly any progress can be reported in the area of       freedom of movement for workers      where preparations for applying the       acquis      remain in the early stages.     Alignment in the areas of       right of establishment and freedom to provide services      also remains at an early stage. No progress has been recorded in the field of right of establishment, freedom to provide cross border services, postal services and the mutual recognition of professional qualifications.     As regards the       free movement of capital      , Turkey made some progress, in particular on capital movements and payments. There has been no progress in the gradual liberalisation of real estate acquisition by foreigners, where various obstacles remain. Restrictions on capital movements remain in place in a number of sectors, including on direct investments originating from the EU. The legal framework against financing of terrorism remains incomplete and the Financial Action Task Force has blacklisted Turkey for its strategic deficiencies in this area.     Limited progress can be reported in the area of       public procurement       .      The institutional set-up is in place, but administrative capacity needs improvement. The draft alignment strategy with a time-bound action plan is ready but has yet to be adopted. Turkey still maintains derogations contradicting the       acquis.      It needs to further align its legislation, particularly on utilities, concessions and public-private partnerships.     As regards       company law      , significant progress can be noted following adoption of the new Turkish Commercial Code, which is expected to promote openness, transparency and adherence to international accounting and auditing standards. The legal and institutional framework for auditing is not yet in place, nor is the necessary enhanced capacity of the commercial judiciary.     Alignment on       intellectual property law      is relatively advanced but enforcement remains poor. The recently launched IPR Working Group with the Commission addresses a key element for the accession negotiations. The adoption of updated draft laws regulating intellectual and industrial property rights, including deterrent criminal sanctions, is still pending. Coordination and cooperation between the different IPR stakeholders and public bodies is essential, as are general awareness campaigns on the risks of IPR infringements.     Turkey has achieved a high level of alignment in the field of       customs      legislation thanks to its Customs Union with the EU. Duty free status of the shops established at entry points and requirements for importers of products in free circulation in the EU to submit information of origin in any format prior to customs clearance is not in line with the Customs Union. Legislation on free zones, surveillance and tariff quotas are yet to be aligned. Improved risk-based controls and simplified procedures would facilitate egitimate trade by reducing the number of physical controls. There is still no effective enforcement of intellectual property rights at customs and measures to tackle counterfeit goods are still acking.

In its 2007 Report, the Commission highlighted progress in the area of free circulation of goods and capital. Progress remained more limited in the areas of the freedom of movement for workers, the right of establishment and the freedom to provide services. Turkey had reached a high level of alignment in terms of the customs union. The chapters on company law and intellectual property noted steps in the right direction, but pointed out that further effort must be made.

The 2005 Report stated that, in spite of the progress made, the free movement of goods was not yet completely effective in Turkey. Alignment with the chapter on freedom of movement for workers had not resulted in any improvement and there had been very little progress as regards the movement of services and capital.

Commission Report [         COM(2000) 713        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      Since the entry into force of the customs union, there has generally been free movement of industrial products between Turkey and the Community. However, there had been little alignment of Turkish legislation with the Community       acquis      to eliminate technical trade barriers.

   Freedom to provide services     Freedom to provide services     The objective of the Communication is to provide economic operators and Member States with the Commission's interpretation, specifically in the context of the Insurance Directives, of the concepts of freedom to provide services and the general good.     ACT     Interpretative communication of the Commission concerning the freedom to provide services and the general good of the insurance sector [Official Journal C 43 of 16.02.2000]     SUMMARY     The main objective of the Third Council Directives Nos       92/96/EEC      (life assurance) and       92/49/EEC      (non-life insurance) is to allow any insurer authorised in a Member State to carry on its insurance activities throughout the European Union, whether under the rules on branches or under the freedom to provide services. The Directives introduced a single system for the financial supervision of an insurer by its Member State of origin (home-country control). However, the Commission has identified differences in the interpretation of the Community rules that are hampering the smooth functioning of the insurance sector within the internal market.      Freedom to provide services and right of establishment in the insurance Directives      Where business is carried on under the freedom to provide services with the provider present on the territory of the Member State of provision, the concept of the provision of services is basically distinguished from that of establishment by its temporary character, while the right of establishment presupposes a lasting presence in the host country. According to the case law of the Court of Justice, the temporary nature of the provision of services is to be assessed in the light of its duration, regularity, frequency and continuity.     However, there is a grey area between the two concepts, in particular in the following cases:      Recourse to independent persons established in the host Member State: On the strength of the Court's case law, the Commission considers that, in order for an insurer to be covered by the rules governing the right of establishment rather than those applicable to the freedom to provide services, the independent person must meet the following three cumulative conditions:- he must be subject to the direction and control of the insurer he represents;- he must be able to commit the insurer;- he must have received a permanent brief.      However, the Commission considers that, in order to conclude insurance policies under the freedom to provide services, an insurer can have recourse to an establishment opened in the Member State of the provision of services for support activities either upstream or downstream of the conclusion of the insurance policy (e.g. use of risk assessment services or of local medical services, receipt of notices of claims relating to policies entered into under the freedom to provide services);      Electronic machines performing insurance business: ATM-type electronic machines can be covered by the right of establishment if they fulfil the above-mentioned criteria laid down by the Court of Justice. For such machines to be treated as establishments, they would have to have human or electronic management.      The use of remote means of communication, in particular electronic commerce, to conclude insurance policies should be regarded as insurance business carried on under the freedom to provide services. In order to determine the place of establishment of the insurer with which a policy is concluded, it is necessary to take account of the Member State of establishment of the insurer doing the business in question rather than the location of the Internet server. The Commission has already stated in its Financial Services Action Plan that it intends to bring out a Green Paper to examine whether the existing provisions of the Directives provide a regulatory framework that is propitious to the development of electronic commerce in financial services while ensuring that the interests of consumers are protected.     The       procedure for notifying      the opening of a branch or the intention to carry on business under the freedom to provide services is designed to facilitate the exchange of information between supervisory authorities. It should not therefore be regarded as a consumer protection measure or as a measure affecting the validity of any insurance policy concluded without the procedure having previously been followed.     The Third Insurance Directives lay down that insurers with head offices in Member States may advertise their services in the Member State of the branch or of the provision of services, subject to any rules governing the form and content of such advertising. There are no forms of advertising (e.g. mail, fax, electronic mail, etc.) that are subject to the notification procedure     .       The general good in the Third Insurance Directives; applicability of rules promoting the general good      A Member State may have recourse to the concept of the general good in order to enforce compliance with its own laws by an insurer wishing to carry on its business within its territory under either the right of establishment or the freedom to provide services. However, the concept of the general good is not provided for in the Insurance Directives, which are limited to a description of the requirements of the Court of Justice.     An insurer must comply with the rules of the host country, even if they entail a restriction. For such a measure to be justified as being in the general good, it:     must not have been harmonised at Community level;      must be non-discriminatory;       must be justified by imperative requirements in the general interest;       must be objectively necessary;       must not duplicate rules of the country of origin;       must be proportionate to the objective pursued.       Application of the "general good" principle       Prior notification      of policy conditions is specifically prohibited except in cases where it is provided for by the Community Directives (e.g. compulsory or health insurance which is a substitute for a statutory social security system). As regards life assurance, a Member State may require notification of the technical bases used for calculating scales of premiums.      Capital redemption operations      of insurers may be carried on anywhere in the Community, even in a Member State where they are not authorised for local life assurance companies on the grounds that such operations are regarded as banking operations and are therefore reserved for credit institutions. However, the insurer must comply with the rules in force in the host Member State which are justified by reasons of the general good (taxation, advertising, etc.).     As regards       uniform no      -       claims bonus systems      (coefficients for the reduction/increase of premiums taken into account in calculating the premiums for third-party motor insurance), the Commission considers that, to the extent that such systems constitute tariff measures, they are contrary to the Third Directive (       92/49/EEC)      . In its view, a Member State cannot invoke the general good in order to preserve the mandatory nature of such systems as the systems have already been coordinated at Community level.     In order to protect consumers, some Member States require the       language of the insurance policy      to be the national language. However, the Commission considers that consumer protection is not a valid reason in the case of large commercial or industrial risks. With regard to mass risks and individual life assurance, account should be taken of policies with an international dimension.      Professional codes of conduct      valid on the territory of a Member State are in principle also valid with regard to foreign insurers and failure to observe them incurs commercial penalties. The Commission also notes that agreements between firms must comply with the competition rules in Article 81 et seq. of the Treaty.      Maximum technical interest rates      for life assurance are fixed by the insurer's home Member State. Since the host Member State has no competence as regards financial supervision of an insurer duly authorised in its home Member State, it follows that it cannot impose compliance with its own prudential principles or check such compliance through substantive control of premium scales.     The       imposition of standard clauses or minimum insurance conditions      is aimed at protecting the weaker party in a contractual relationships whilst maintaining a contractual balance. The Commission considers that such a clause should be imposed only where it is objectively necessary.     With regard to       clauses imposing mandatory levels of excess      in insurance policies, insurers should be free to assess the advisability of including an excess in the policies which they market. Where an insurer is approved by its home Member State, it should be free to decide market insurance policies, with or without excesses, in the host Member State, clearly indicating to customers that it is doing so without being forced by binding national rules.      Compulsory stipulation of a surrender value      in life assurance policies is justified by the concept of the general good, as it gives consumers flexibility and the ability to mobilise their savings. However, the Commission wonders whether there are other means, such as the obligation to give detailed information to the policyholder prior to the conclusion of a policy, which could protect the economic interests of policyholders.     In order for a host Member State to introduce practical arrangements for charging indirect taxes on insurance premiums for policies concluded under the freedom to provide services by appointing a       tax representative of the insurer      , the arrangements must comply with the requirements of proportionality and necessity laid down in the case law of the Court of Justice.     The Court of Justice has already recognised the right to prohibit the marketing practice of       "cold calling"      in order to protect consumers.      Legal remedy      Operators faced with a national rule that constitutes an unjustified restriction of the freedom of establishment or the freedom to provide services may resort to the courts or lodge a complaint with the Commission.

   Common framework for joint multiannual programming     Common framework for joint multiannual programming     This communication proposes a common framework for programming development aid so as to make it more effective. Programming of this kind is part of the European Union (EU) action plan for effective aid.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 2 March 2006: Increasing the impact of EU aid: A common framework for drafting country strategy papers and joint multiannual programming [       COM(2006) 88      final - Official Journal C 130 of 3 June 2006].     SUMMARY     The programming framework for the country strategy papers (CSPs) is a multiannual programming instrument that was adopted in 2000 as part of the reform of the management of the Commission's external aid. Between 2000 and 2006 it was applied in the programming of the CSPs and the regional strategy papers (RSPs) for all the developing countries benefiting from the       European Development Fund      (EDF) and from the       ALA      ,       Meda      ,       Tacis      and       Cards      programmes. The use of CSPs/RSPs was a way of improving the quality of the Commission's programming. The quality and effectiveness of the CSPs was further improved by the 2004 and 2005 mid-term reviews; the regional strategies were revised in 2005.     The communication proposes an updating of the 2000 CSP framework with a view to introducing joint multiannual programming aimed at:      facilitating the gradual alignment of lenders on the multiannual programming cycles of the partner country;       increasing the possibility of synchronising the programming processes of the Member States and the Commission.      Joint multiannual programming is one of the components of the European Union (EU)       action plan      for effective aid and one of the principles set out in the       European Consensus on Development      .      The principles of effective programming      The Commission recommends that the structure of the CSPs and its main components be guided by the following principles:      compliance with cooperation and partnership agreements and consistency with regional strategies;       compatibility with the objectives of the European Consensus (eradication of poverty, sustainable development, promotion of democracy, etc.);       consistency between the objectives of development policy and those of other policies defining relations with the partner country;       allowance for the diverse nature of partners, as regards both general policy and cooperation programmes, and for cross-cutting issues such as gender equality, human rights and a sustainable environment;       sharing of information between all concerned and complementarity between the activities of the Commission and the Member States and those of other international donors;       use of budget support, whether general or sectoral, for implementation;       focus on a limited number of areas for inclusion;       preparations for the strategy and programming on the basis of the partner country's agenda;       a results-based approach to programming, implementation and evaluation in order to measure the impact of aid;       involvement of civil society, the private sector, local authorities and parliaments in drawing up and implementing the cooperation strategy;       regular evaluation of the performance of CSPs with a view to adjusting strategies in the light of the findings.       The essential components for CSPs      The Commission proposes that the CSPs include the following components, which, in its view, are essential:      the framework for relations between the donor and the partner country (including association and partnership agreements);       country analysis:      - the political, economic, commercial, social and environmental situation in the partner country;     - the partner country's agenda, including the development strategy;     - the viability of the country's current policies and medium-term strategies;      an overview of past and present cooperation with the donor;       a description of the state of the partnership with the country;       the donor's cooperation strategy and specific objectives, the consistency of the strategy with other external aid instruments and policies, and complementarity with other donors;       a national indicative programme (NIP), i.e. a work programme covering several years and defining measurable objectives, the target groups, the programmes for achieving those objectives, the contribution to be made by the donor, the nature and scope of the support mechanisms, the results expected and an implementation timetable;       annexes, including a summary table for the country, a short environmental profile, a prospective donor matrix, a migration profile, an account of consultations with non-state actors and a harmonisation roadmap where there is one.      Using these components, the Commission will draw up its CSPs on the basis of a gradual approach starting immediately with the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries (ACP) and followed at a later date by Asia, Latin America, the countries covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy and Russia.      The procedure for drawing up a CSP      Joint programming must be a process that is:      flexible and thus able to take on different forms depending on the situation in the partner countries and on the donors and their readiness for harmonisation;       gradual in that it must make provision for gradual stages of integration as the situation develops;       open in that it should not be restricted to Member States and can merge into any existing processes aimed at introducing joint programming;       conducive to the partner country playing a leading role in preparing the ground and coordinating joint programming. If the country does not have that capacity, it must be given the support it needs to acquire it;       a forum for the Commission delegations and other development partners on the ground so as to ensure frequent exchanges between headquarters and local offices.       The stages of joint programming      The first stage of joint programming is joint analysis of the elements essential for drawing up a cooperation strategy, namely:      evaluation of the global political situation;       appraisal of the country's macroeconomic, social and environmental background;       formulation of the partner country's priorities;       analysis of lessons from cooperation in the past and analysis of consistency with the partner country's other policies.      The second stage is the formulation of a joint strategic response involving:      joint setting of cooperation objectives with the partner country;       selection of focal areas, including a division of labour between the partners (donor matrix);       an outline of financial allocations and risk analysis, and commitments by the partner countries on the basis of a joint agreement.

summary of   Directive 2012/29/EU – minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime   summary    what does the directive do   Known as the Victims’ Directive, it reinforces existing national measures with EU-wide minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime in every EU country.    Victims must have the right to:   understand and to be understood during contact with an authority (for example plain and simple language);   receive information from the first contact with an authority;   make a formal complaint and receive written acknowledgement;   interpretation and translation (at least during interviews/questioning of the victim);   receive information about the case’s progress;   access victim support services.     key points    Its main goals are to ensure that victims of crime receive appropriate information, support and protection and may participate in criminal proceedings wherever the damage occurred in the EU.   Every EU country must ensure that victims of crime are  recognised and treated in a respectful, sensitive and professional manner  according to their individual needs and without any discrimination (for example based on nationality, resident status, race, religion, age, gender, etc.).   The directive lays down minimum standards for all victims of all crimes  regardless of victims’ nationality or residence status  . As soon as a crime is committed or criminal proceedings take place in the EU, the victim must be granted the rights established by the victims’ directive. Under the directive, family members of deceased victims are considered victims themselves.   The directive establishes the following  rights  .   These victims must have the right to:   have their case heard in court;   review a court’s decision not to prosecute;   have their expenses reimbursed;   receive legal aid;   recover stolen property.     National authorities must minimise the difficulties faced when the victim is a resident of an EU country other than that where the offence was committed.   from when does the directive apply  It entered into force on 15 November 2012. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 16 November 2015.   background   The directive replaces Council Framework Decision on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings (  2001/220/JHA  ).

   MEDIA 2007: programme of support for the European audiovisual sector     MEDIA 2007: programme of support for the European audiovisual sector     MEDIA 2007 is the new programme of support for the European audiovisual sector, following on from the       MEDIA Plus      and       MEDIA Training      programmes. MEDIA 2007 is conceived as a single programme combining the two existing parts (development, distribution and promotion / training). It has a budget of almost 755 million and covers the period 2007-13.     ACT     Decision No       1718/2006/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 November 2006 concerning the implementation of the Programme of support for the European Audiovisual sector (MEDIA 2007).     SUMMARY     The audiovisual sector is an essential vehicle for conveying and developing European cultural values. It plays a crucial role in the creation of a European cultural identity and the expression of European citizenship. The circulation of European audiovisual works (films and television programmes) helps to increase intercultural dialogue and to improve mutual understanding and knowledge of European cultures. Community support is therefore designed to enable the European audiovisual sector to play its part in consolidating European citizenship and culture.     In addition to the cultural aspect, Europe's audiovisual sector also has great social and economic potential. Community support for the audiovisual sector is therefore also in line with the       Lisbon strategy      , which aims to make the EU the most competitive and dynamic economy in the world.     With its MEDIA 2007 programme, the Commission intends to continue EU action taken in the       MEDIA I      ,       MEDIA II      ,       MEDIA Plus      and       MEDIA Training      programmes, which have encouraged the development of Europe's audiovisual industry since 1991.      GENERAL OBJECTIVES      MEDIA 2007 is established for the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013. The global objectives of the programme are to:      preserve and enhance Europe's cultural and linguistic diversity and its cinema and audiovisual heritage, guarantee public access to it and promote intercultural dialogue;       increase the circulation and audience of European audiovisual works inside and outside the European Union;       boost the competitiveness of the European audiovisual sector in an open and competitive market that is propitious to employment.      To achieve these objectives, MEDIA 2007 will promote initiatives:       upstream of audiovisual production to promote the acquisition and refining of skills        and to support the development of European audiovisual works (pre-production stages);        downstream of audiovisual production        to support the distribution and promotion of European audiovisual works (post-production stages);       to support         pilot projects        to ensure that the programme keeps pace with developments in the market.      In these areas of activity, the programme's priorities are to:      encourage the creative process within Europe's audiovisual sector and disseminate its cinema and audiovisual heritage;       strengthen the base of the European audiovisual sector, particularly SMEs;       reduce the imbalances in the European audiovisual market between high audiovisual production capacity countries and countries or regions with low audiovisual production capacity and/or a small geographic and linguistic market. This priority serves the need to preserve and enhance cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue in Europe and, lastly,       keep pace with market developments with regard to digitisation.       BUDGET      The total amount available for this programme is approximately 755 million.      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES AND INITIATIVES       Pre-production      Upstream of audiovisual production, the programme's objectives are as follows:       acquisition and improvement of skills in the audiovisual sector        : the programme supports projects aiming at improving the creative and management skills of European audiovisual professionals as well as adapting their technical skills to digital technologies. The objective is also to increase the European dimension of audiovisual training activities by supporting the networking and mobility of those involved (European film schools, training institutes, partners in the sector). Special scholarships will be set up for professionals from the new Member States to help them meet the challenges of the enlarged European audiovisual market;        development        : the programme aims to support the development stage of production projects submitted by independent production companies. It will help them to draw up sound financial plans, including the financing of co-productions.       Post-production      Downstream of audiovisual production, the programme's objectives are as follows:       distribution and dissemination        : support for the distribution and dissemination phases continues to be a priority with a view to consolidating the single European market and making the audiovisual industry more competitive. If European audiovisual works are to compete globally, it is essential to establish a European distribution strategy. Community measures are designed to:        promotion        : in this field, the aim of the programme will be to encourage the circulation of European audiovisual works by ensuring they have access to European and international markets. The programme will also aim to give the European and international public greater access to European audiovisual works. It will encourage joint actions between national bodies for the promotion of audiovisual programmes and films and measures to promote Europe's cinema and audiovisual heritage;       Pilot projects       The programme will encourage innovation through supporting pilot projects, in particular concerning the use of information and communication technologies. Pilot projects will ensure that the programme is adjusted in line with technological developments.       IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS       Provisions concerning third countries      Provided the required conditions are met and additional appropriations are received, the programme is open to the following countries:      EFTA countries which are members of the European Economic Area (EEA);       accession countries benefiting from a strategy for pre-accession to the EU;       the Western Balkan countries (in accordance with the provisions of the framework agreements governing their participation in Community programmes);       States which are signatories to the Council of Europe Convention on         Transfrontier Television        ;       other third countries which have concluded association and cooperation agreements with the EU incorporating clauses on the audiovisual sector.       Beneficiaries and financial provisions      Natural persons may be beneficiaries of the programme. Depending on the type of action, financial aid may take the form of grants or scholarships.     Financial assistance awarded under the programme may not exceed 50 % of the costs of the activities supported. In certain specific cases, assistance of up to 75 % of costs may be provided.      Implementation      The Commission, assisted by a committee, will be responsible for implementing the programme.     The implementing body is represented by the European network of       MEDIA desks      . This ensures the dissemination of information on the programme at national level, in particular for cross-border projects.

summary of   Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 — thematic objectives for ESI Funds — Article 9   what is the aim of this article  Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 contains the  main common rules  in regard to the  European Structural and Investment (ESI) Funds  for the 2014-2020 programming period, which aim to support the EU’s  Europe 2020 strategy  for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. Article 9 of this regulation sets out objectives for these investments under various themes, with the goal of focusing EU  cohesion policy  funding on areas that deliver the highest benefits to citizens.   key points   ESI funds consist of  5 funds  : the  European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)  , the  European Social Fund (ESF)  , the  Cohesion Fund  , the  European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development  and the  European Maritime and Fisheries Fund  .  As well as the fund-specific missions, each ESI Fund supports  investment priorities  known as thematic objectives:    1.    Strengthening  research, technological development and innovation  ;      2.    Enhancing access to, and use and quality of  information and communication technologies  ;      3.    Enhancing the competitiveness of   small and medium-sized enterprises   ;      4.    Supporting the shift towards a  low-carbon economy  ;      5.    Promoting  climate change  adaptation, risk prevention and management;      6.    Preserving and  protecting the environment  and promoting resource efficiency;      7.    Promoting  sustainable transport  and removing bottlenecks in key network infrastructures;      8.    Promoting sustainable and quality  employment  and supporting labour mobility;      9.    Promoting  social inclusion  , combating poverty and any discrimination;      10.    Investing in  education and training  for skills and lifelong learning;      11.    Enhancing the capability of public authorities and  efficient public administration  .     Thematic objectives are translated into priorities specific to each of the ESI Funds. Themes 1-4 are key themes for the ERDF, while themes 8-11 are key themes for the ESF.   Integrated, coordinated and complementary approach   EU countries must make sure that their choice of thematic objectives meets the development needs and territorial challenges, and ensures an integrated delivery of the ESI funds.   Coordination and synergies between ESI funds and other EU policies   EU countries and the  European Commission  must consider the most suitable means of using EU funds to support investment, coordinating between the ESI Funds and other EU instruments, including:    common agricultural policy  and the  common fisheries policy  ;    Horizon 2020  and other centrally-managed EU programmes in the areas of research and innovation;    New Entrants Reserve (NER) 300  demonstration funding;    Programme for the environment and climate action (LIFE)  ;    ERASMUS+  ;    EU programme for employment and social innovation  ;    Connecting Europe Facility  ;    Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance  ,  European Neighbourhood Instrument  and  European Development Fund  .    Underlying principles   Core transverse policy objectives cut across all ESI funding thematic priorities:   partnership and multi-level governance;    sustainable development  ;   promotion of  equality between men and women  and  non-discrimination  ;   accessibility;   addressing demographic change;   climate change mitigation and adaptation.    Addressing key territorial challenges   EU countries must take account of geographic or demographic features when applying for ESI funding and address the specific territorial challenges of each region to unlock its specific development potential.   from when does this regulation apply  It has applied since 21 December 2013.   background   For more information see:    Thematic objectives  (  European Commission  ).
act   Council Decision  2010/707/EU  of 21 October 2010 on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States.   summary   The EU Member States take the guidelines for employment policies into account when drafting their policies and setting national targets. The latest guidelines are valid until the end of 2014.  The guidelines are associated with the  broad guidelines for economic policies  , together forming integrated guidelines for the  Europe 2020 strategy  . They also underpin the EU's annual Joint Employment Report.   Increasing labour market participation   The EU aims to increase the employment rate for women and men aged 20-64 to 75% by 2020. In their policies, Member States must therefore promote the labour market participation of young people, older workers, low-skilled workers and legal migrants. They must also make employment more attractive - focusing on flexicurity, worker mobility and work-life balance - and promote self-employment, entrepreneurship, plus job creation, including in the areas of care and green jobs.   Developing a skilled workforce   Workers' productivity and employability can be increased by developing new skills that correspond to labour market needs. Member States must extend the capacity of education and training systems and adapt them to societal trends in line with a low-carbon and resource-efficient economy.  Measures must focus on high-quality initial education, lifelong training, and training must be open to low-skilled or highly skilled workers.  Member States should also encourage labour mobility, with systems for recognising people's acquired competences.   Improving education and training systems   By 2020, early school leaving is to be reduced to less than 10% and at least 40% of 30-34 year-olds are to have completed tertiary or equivalent education. Member States must promote lifelong learning, international mobility of teachers and learners, development of qualification frameworks for flexible learning pathways, and partnerships with enterprises.   Combating social exclusion   The Europe 2020 strategy promotes social inclusion and combats poverty, so that 20 million people no longer face the risk of poverty and exclusion.  Member States should boost the employment of those furthest away from the labour market, so as to empower people and combat in-work poverty.  National policies must guarantee access to affordable, sustainable and high-quality services, including in the social sector. They should also modernise and support social protection and pension systems.  Lastly, Member States should support the social economy and social innovation, fostering equal opportunities and combating discrimination.

   Partnership for the accession of Slovakia     Partnership for the accession of Slovakia     The aim of the Accession Partnership is to assist the authorities in the candidate country in their efforts to comply with the accession criteria. It covers in detail the priorities for accession preparations, in particular implementing the acquis, and forms the basis for programming pre-accession assistance from Community funds such as the Phare programme. Following the signing of the Accession Treaty on 16 April 2003 and the official integration of the country into the European Union on 1 May 2004, the accession partnership has come to an end.     In its communication "       Agenda 2000      ", the European Commission set out a range of proposals for strengthening the pre-accession strategy for all the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The general objective of this strategy is to offer a coherent programme for preparing these countries for membership of the European Union, and more particularly:      to bring together the various forms of aid offered by the European Union within a single framework, the accession partnerships;       to familiarise applicants with the European Union's procedures and policies by offering them the opportunity to participate in Community programmes.      1) OBJECTIVE     The objective of the partnership for accession (adopted in March 1998 and amended in December 1999 and in January 2002), is to lay down in law the working priorities set out in the Commission's Opinion on Slovakia's application for membership, the financial resources available to help Slovakia implement these priorities and the conditions which apply to this aid. The partnership provides the framework for a range of instruments designed to support candidate countries as they prepare for membership.     These instruments include a national programme for the adoption of the       acquis      (NPAA), joint assessment of medium-term economic policy priorities, a pact against organised crime, a national development plan and other sectoral plans necessary for participation in the Structural Funds after accession and to implement       ISPA      and       Sapard      prior to accession. In 2002, the partnership for accession served as the starting point for preparing an action plan to reinforce the administrative and judicial capacity of Slovakia.     Those instruments are not an integral part of the partnership, but the priorities they contain will be compatible with it.     The implementation of the partnership for accession will be monitored under the Europe Agreement between the European Union and Slovakia.     2) PRIORITIES     These are divided into two groups: short and medium term. The priority issues of the first group are those which Slovakia was likely to resolve or make progress with over the course of the year 2000. Those in the second group should be settled by the end of 2003.     Slovakia has largely achieved the political criteria priorities. The economic criteria priorities have been partly achieved. As for the priorities in the areas of competition policy, statistics, culture and audiovisual policy, the environment, consumer protection and health, cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs, customs union and financial control, these have been largely achieved. In the other areas, the priorities have been partly achieved.     In December 1999, the partnership for accession priorities were revised (see p. 3 of the Annex to Decision       1999/853/EC)      . A final revision was published in February 2002 (Decision       2002/934/EC)      . It provides the reference on which the Commission report of 2002 is based.     The priority areas are as follows:     (for up-to-date information on this subject, please refer to the Adoption of the Community acquis section)       Political criteria         Economic reform         Institutional and administrative capacity building         Internal market         Environment         Economic policy         Justice and home affairs         Agriculture         Energy         Transport         Employment and social affairs         Regional policy and cohesion       3) FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK      Phare      The 2000       Phare Programme      for Slovakia provided for a national allocation of EUR 28 million. Another EUR 6 million were set aside for a programme of cross-border cooperation with Austria, EUR 4 million were earmarked for cooperation with Poland and EUR 2 million for cooperation with Hungary. EUR 43.5 million were granted through Phare 2001. The programme also allocated EUR 25 million to decommission the Bohunice nuclear power station. A further EUR 12 million were allocated to cross-border cooperation with Austria (EUR 6 million), Poland (EUR 4 million) and Hungary (EUR 2 million). Phare 2002 provided for a national allocation of EUR 37 million for Slovakia. A further EUR 20.1 million were earmarked under the facility specified by the programme to strengthen the country's institutions. The national allocation included an envelope of EUR 12 million intended for cross-border cooperation.     The authorities of the partner country assume responsibility for aid-related contracts and payments. However, under the EC Financial Regulation, the Commission must monitor the contract award procedure and approve all contracts financed by Phare and signed by the partner country prior to their entry into force.      Pre-accession aid      From 2000, financial assistance comprises aid for agriculture and rural development (       Sapard      ) and a structural instrument (       ISPA      ) which will give priority to measures in the field of transport and the environment. The Regulation coordinating Phare aid, Sapard and ISPA, adopted in June 1999, enables the Commission to carry out ex-post checks on the contracts if it considers the checks carried out by the partner country to be insufficient.     Over the period 2000-2002, the financial assistance available totalled EUR 80.5 million annually for Phare, EUR 18.6 million annually for SAPARD and between EUR 3.5 and 5.5 million for ISPA. The SAPARD 2002 envelope for Slovakia was EUR 19.2 million and that for the ISPA programme was between EUR 38.1 and 59.9 million.     4) REFERENCES      Decision         98/262/EC        of 30 March 1998Official Journal L 121 of 23.04.1998       Decision         1999/853/EC        of 6 December 1999Official Journal L 335 of 28.12.1999       Commission Opinion COM(97) 2004 finalNot published in the Official Journal       Commission Report COM(98) 703 finalNot published in the Official Journal       Commission Report COM(1999) 511 finalNot published in the Official Journal       Commission Report COM(2000) 711 finalNot published in the Official Journal       Commission Report COM(2001) 700 final - SEC(2001) 1754Not published in the Official Journal       Decision 2002/93/EC of 28.01.2002Official Journal L44 of 14.02.2002       Commission Report COM(2002) 700 final      -       SEC(2002) 1410Not published in the Official Journal       Treaty of Accession to the European Union [Official Journal L 236, 23.09.2003]      Last updated: 19.11.2004  
summary of   Decision (CFSP) 2015/1835 — statute, seat and operational rules of the European Defence Agency   summary    what does this decision do  It lays down rules on the functioning of the  European Defence Agency  (EDA), thus providing a legal and institutional framework to enable EU countries to cooperate in developing military capabilities in the context of the EU’s  common foreign and security policy  , and in particular, the  common security and defence policy  (CSDP).   key points   The tasks of the EDA are to:   contribute to identifying EU countries’ military capability objectives and evaluate their capability commitments,   promote the harmonisation of operational needs (e.g. by promoting and coordinating harmonisation of military requirements or by promoting cost-effective and efficient procurement by identifying and disseminating best practice),   introduce projects to fulfil military capability objectives and ensure coordination programmes are implemented by EU countries,   support defence technology research and coordinate/plan joint research activities,   contribute to strengthening the EU defence sector’s industrial base to improve the effectiveness of military expenditure,   pursue coherence with other EU policies which have defence implications,   foster deeper defence cooperation between EU countries,   provide support for CSDP operations.    Governance of the EDA:    The EDA is headquartered in Brussels and is under the political supervision and the authority of the  Council of the EU  , to which it reports and from which it receives guidelines.   The  High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy  is the  Head of Agency  , who leads the Steering Board and provides the link between the EDA and the Council.   The  Chief Executive  of the EDA, assisted by the Deputy Chief Executive, is responsible for the oversight and coordination of the EDA's work. They are appointed by the Steering Board.   The decision-making body of the EDA is the  Steering Board  , which is comprised of Defence Ministers from each EU country (except for Denmark) and a  European Commission  representative. It meets at least twice a year to decide on matters including the annual budget, work programme and new initiatives.   Funding:   The operating costs of the EDA are funded by EU countries (except for Denmark) in proportion to their  gross national income  (GNI).   Individual projects are funded separately by the participating EU countries.   from when does the decision apply  It applies from 13 October 2015.   background   The EDA was established in 2004. Since then, a number of amendments have been made regarding its statute, seat and operational rules. These changes have been consolidated in this decision.

summary of   Directive 2012/28/EU — certain permitted uses of orphan works   what is the aim of this directive  It is designed to promote the digitisation of and lawful intra-EU online access to orphan works  *  contained in the collections of libraries, educational establishments, museums, archives, audiovisual heritage institutions and public service broadcasting organisations.  These organisations have a  public interest mission  to:   preserve,   restore,   reproduce, and   provide online access to their collections, for cultural and educational reasons.   After completing the  diligent search   *  these organisations will be permitted to use orphan works for these purposes.   key points    Scope   The directive applies to works protected by copyright that are first published or, in the absence of publication, broadcast (shown on television or online, i.e. visual media, rather than written media) in a EU country.  The directive applies to several categories of works:   published books, newspapers, magazines or other writings;   works embedded or incorporated in the above categories;   cinematographic or audiovisual works and phonograms.    Status of orphan work    The organisations covered by the directive must ensure that a  diligent search  for rightsholders is carried out in good faith by consulting the appropriate sources to verify the  orphan work status  .   The directive indicates that EU countries must determine the appropriate sources and include a list of sources that should at least be consulted when performing a  diligent search  .   Material that is considered as orphaned in one EU country has the same status in all other EU countries.   In an event if rightsholder of what is considered to be an orphan work reappears, the directive envisages the possibility of putting an end to the orphan work status and receiving fair compensation.    Database    A single, Europe-wide, publicly accessible  online database   will be set up, containing information on orphan works, including:   results of searches for rightsholders;   use made of orphan works by organisations;   any changes in the orphan work status of works used.   This ensures that both the organisations carrying out the searches and the rightsholders can find information about identification and use of orphan works.   Permitted uses   Organisations covered by the directive may use an orphan work only to achieve aims related to their public-interest missions:   to make the orphan work available to the public;   to reproduce the orphan work for the purposes of digitisation, making available, indexing, cataloguing, preservation or restoration.   The organisations may generate revenues in the course of such uses, for the exclusive purpose of covering their costs of digitising orphan works and making them available to the public.   from when does the directive apply  The directive has applied since 29 October 2014 and it had to become law in the EU countries on the same day.   background     Orphan works database  (  EUIPO Observatory  ).   key terms    Orphan Works:  works like books, newspaper and magazine articles and films that are still protected by copyright but whose authors or other righstholders are not known or cannot be located or contacted to obtain copyright permissions.   Diligent search:  thorough search aiming to identify and/or locate the author of copyright materials or other rightsholders.
   Mechanism for monitoring greenhouse gas emissions     Mechanism for monitoring greenhouse gas emissions     The European Union established a new mechanism for monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions so as to be able to evaluate more accurately and more regularly the progress made in reducing emissions with a view to complying with the Community's commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol.     ACT     Decision       280/2004/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 February 2004 concerning a mechanism for monitoring Community greenhouse gas emissions and for implementing the Kyoto Protocol.     SUMMARY     The Decision establishes a mechanism designed to:      monitor, in the Member States, all anthropogenic greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrogen oxides (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6)) emissions (including their removal by sinks) not controlled by the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer;       evaluate progress made in this field to ensure compliance with the Community's commitments concerning emissions and their removal;       implement the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol;       ensure that information reported by the Community to the UNFCCC Secretariat is complete, accurate, consistent, transparent and comparable.       National and Community inventories      Member States and the Community establish national inventory systems which enable them to estimate the emission and removal of greenhouse gases in their territory.     Each year, Member States must communicate to the Commission (by 15 January each year at the latest) other information on greenhouse gas emissions. The Commission then prepares an inventory and a report on the greenhouse gases in the Community. It sends the report to the Member States before 28 February and to the Secretariat of the UNFCCC before 15 April. These reports enable progress under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol to be assessed.      National and Community programmes      The Member States and the Community respectively must devise, publish and implement national programmes and a Community programme to limit or reduce anthropogenic emissions by sources and enhance the removal, by sinks, of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol.      National and Community registries      The Community and its Member States must establish registries accounting for the issue, holding, transfer, cancellation and withdrawal of units and incorporating the registries established under the Community scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading.      Assessment of progress made      Each year, the Commission evaluates whether the progress made throughout the Community is sufficient to meet the commitments made at international level under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol.     The Commission must submit an annual progress evaluation report to the European Parliament and the Council. This report must include information on projected emissions and removals, and on policies and measures taken to reduce emissions.      Assigned amounts      By 31 December 2006, the Community and each Member State informed the UNFCCC Secretariat of the emission levels assigned to them pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol and       Decision 2002/358/EC      concerning the approval of the Kyoto Protocol and the joint fulfilment of commitments thereunder (Decision       2010/778/EU      ).

   Kosovo – Towards European integration     Kosovo – Towards European integration     Kosovo is a potential candidate for accession to the European Union (EU) according to the status defined by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244. Kosovo has made progress in its reforms. However, the Commission reviews the efforts still needed to bring it closer to the EU.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council of 17 December 2009 – Kosovo – Fulfilling its European Perspective [       COM(2009) 534      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     According to the status defined by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, Kosovo has made progress towards accession to the European Union (EU). Kosovo participates in the EU’s stabilisation and association process for the Western Balkans.     The       progress      made relates in the first instance to the adaptation of legislation to European standards and the establishment of a viable fiscal framework. However, Kosovo still faces       major challenges      on political, economic and social levels.     The EU provides technical and financial assistance to support the reforms. Among other things, Kosovo benefits from the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance, the CARDS programme and the Instrument for Stability.      Accelerating reforms      In 2008 and 2009, Kosovo adopted plans for measures corresponding to the objectives of the       European Partnership      . In particular, the reforms are intended to improve the following:      the functioning of the State, the judiciary and public administration;       fiscal policy and economic stability;       public procurement and the business environment;       the fight against corruption, money laundering and organised crime;       social cohesion;       the protection of minorities, in particular Serbs, and reconciliation between the communities.       Free movement of persons      Kosovo citizens now benefit from simplified procedures for obtaining short-stay visas in EU countries. Visa requirements are to be relaxed further if Kosovo makes progress concerning:      readmission arrangements for Kosovo citizens,       the fight against organised crime,       the security of identity documents,       the monitoring of migration and border security.      Kosovo is also to participate in the judicial cooperation work of       Europol      ,       Eurojust      and       Frontex      .      Kosovo’s socio-economic development      Kosovo has been relatively little affected by the international economic crisis due to its limited integration into global trade. However, remittances and inflows of foreign investment decreased in 2009. In addition, Kosovo’s budget and trade deficits are considerable.     The EU supports Kosovo in several sectors:       trade        - the Commission proposes a regime of exceptional trade measures which may be replaced in due time by another preferential regime for products from Kosovo (         Pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation of origin        );        macro-economic and fiscal stability        - in the context of the EU-Kosovo economic dialogue and Kosovo’s membership of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF);       the         private sector        - to benefit small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and to promote privatisation and innovation;        social policies        and         employment        - to strengthen job centres, work incentive and social inclusion schemes. In particular, Kosovo is associated with the European         PROGRESS        programme;        education        ,         training        and         research        - in particular through European student exchange programmes and the 7th Framework Programme for Research;        culture        and civic         life        - for the benefit of civil society organisations in particular.      Kosovo’s efforts should be extended to new sectors:       energy        - in order to privatise the sector, to increase energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies;        transport        - to improve the rail and road infrastructure, and with regard to Kosovo’s participation in the European Common Aviation Area;        environment        - measures should be taken to protect public health (drinking water, air quality, etc.), and to implement European legislation effectively.       Regional cooperation      Kosovo’s cooperation with the other countries of Southern Europe is essential for its commercial development, economic growth and political stability. However, its participation in regional forums remains a sensitive political issue. Similarly, a blockade has been maintained on Kosovo’s exports to Serbia and on transit trade with Bosnia and Herzegovina.     Kosovo’s external representation is carried out by       UNMIK      (United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo).      EU-Kosovo dialogue      Kosovo conducts a regular dialogue with the EU on the themes of innovation, the internal market, good governance, agriculture, the economy and infrastructures.      EU financial assistance      Aid allocated by the EU is targeted to a limited number of priorities. The funding allocated under the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA) amounts to EUR 359 million for the period 2007-2009 and EUR 206 million for 2010-2012. These funds are to be used to finance cross-border activities.      Context      Kosovo’s independence has been recognised by 22 out of 27 EU countries. This lack of a shared position does not prevent the EU from adopting measures to support its economic and political development.     In addition, the EU supports Kosovo’s stability through:      the presence of a civilian mission in the context of European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP),       the appointment of a Special Representative for political reform,       the establishment of the European         EULEX        mission for the rule of law (police, the judiciary and customs).

act   Council Directive  2004/113/EC  implementing the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services.   summary    what is the aim of this directive  The directive establishes a framework for combatting all gender discrimination in access and supply of goods and services, in both the public and private sectors.  The directive applies to goods and services offered to the public, regardless of the persons concerned (that is to say, whatever the personal circumstances of the service recipient) and which are offered outside of the private and family spheres. The term ‘services’ indicates services provided in exchange for remuneration.  The directive does not apply to either the content of media or advertising, or education.   key aspects    Ban on discrimination in the field of goods and services  : in principle, the directive prohibits:   any less favourable treatment of men or women by reason of their gender;   any less favourable treatment of women due to pregnancy or maternity;   harassment, sexual harassment or any incitement to discriminate with regard to the offer or supply of goods or services.   Differential treatment can only be accepted if it is justified by a legitimate objective such as, for example protection of victims of sexual abuse (in the case of creating women’s refuges), freedom of association (in the context of membership of unisex private clubs) or organisation of unisex sporting activities. Any limitation must be appropriate and necessary.  The principle of equal treatment does not preclude taking affirmative action to prevent or compensate for gender inequalities in the area of goods and services.  The directive establishes only minimal requirements to allow EU countries to be able to maintain higher or more extensive levels of protection.   Application to the field of insurance  : the directive prohibits taking gender into consideration when calculating insurance premiums and benefits in insurance agreements signed after 21 December 2007.  Nonetheless, the directive provided for the option for EU countries not to apply this prohibition in cases where gender was a determining factor in risk assessment and based on relevant actuarial and statistical data. However, the Court of Justice of the European Union, in its ruling on the Test-Achats case (  C-236/09  ) declared invalid the derogation from the principle of equal treatment which allowed EU countries to differentiate between men and women with regard to insurance premiums and benefits, with effect from 21 December 2012.  Henceforth, for all new agreements signed since this date,  the principle of a unisex tariff applies to the insurance sector  . In order to facilitate implementation of the Court’s ruling, the Commission adopted  Guidelines  on the application of the directive to the insurance sector.  In any case, the costs associated with pregnancy and maternity must not lead to differences in terms of premiums and benefits.   Bodies promoting equal treatment  : each EU country charges one or several bodies with promoting and monitoring equal treatment of men and women at national level. These bodies are responsible for (i) offering victims independent assistance, (ii) carrying out independent studies, (iii) publishing independent reports and making recommendations.   Defending victims’rights  : the directive obligates EU countries to ensure that victims have access to a judicial and/or administrative procedure to safeguard their rights, and that victims can obtain the appropriate reparation or compensation. Associations, organisations and other legal persons with a legitimate interest are also able to engage in a judicial and/or administrative procedure to allow victims to safeguard their rights and to obtain reparation or compensation.  When facts presented before a tribunal support the presumption of the existence of discrimination, it falls to the defendant to prove that there has been no infringement of the principle of equal treatment (rebuttal of the  charge  ).  Furthermore, EU countries must put in place sanctions in case of infringement of the principle of equal treatment.   from when does the directive apply  The directive came into force on 21 December 2004 and it should have been transposed into EU country law by 21 December 2007 at the latest.   context   Equality between men and women is a fundamental principle of the European Union, laid down in Articles  2  and  3  of the Treaty on European Union. Gender discrimination may constitute an obstacle to full and successful integration of men and women into economic and social life.   key terminology    Direct discrimination  : circumstances in which a person is treated less favourably, by reason of their gender, than another person who, in a similar situation, is not, has not been or would not be.   Indirect discrimination  : circumstances in which an apparently neutral provision, criterion or practice is likely to lead to a specific disadvantage for persons of the opposite sex, unless this provision, criterion or practice is objectively justified by a legitimate objective and the means of realising this objective are appropriate and necessary.   Harassment  : circumstances in which unwanted conduct related to a person’s gender takes place, with the aim or effect of attacking the person’s dignity and creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment.   Sexual harassment  : circumstances in which unwanted sexual conduct, expressed physically, verbally or non-verbally, takes place, with the aim or effect of attacking the person’s dignity and creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment.

summary of   Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 608/2014 on implementing the EU own resources system   what is the aim of the regulation   It establishes certain rules for implementing the EU's  own resources system  set out in Council Decision 2014/335/EU, Euratom —  EU's own resources  .   It contains rules for:   the calculation and budgeting of the balances  *  ,   their control and supervision, and   reporting requirements for national authorities.     It is complemented by Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 609/2014 which sets out the  methods and procedures for making own resources  available to the  European Commission  .   key points   The EU's own resources provide its main revenue. EU annual expenditure must be completely covered by its annual revenue.  There are  3 types  of own resources:    1.     Traditional own resources  consisting mainly of customs duties on imports from outside the EU and sugar levies. EU countries keep 25% of the amounts as collection costs.      2.     Own resources based on value added tax  (  VAT  ) — a uniform rate of 0.3% is levied on the EU-wide standard VAT base of each EU country.      3.     Own resources based on gross national income (GNI)  — each EU country transfers a standard percentage of its GNI to the EU.      Control and supervision   Concerning  traditional own resources  , EU countries must:   conduct checks and enquiries regarding the establishment and the making available of those own resources   carry out additional inspection measures at the Commission's request   The Commission may involve itself in these inspections and may also carry out its own spot checks.  Concerning  own resources based on GNI  , the Commission must:   inspect certain estimates, calculations and statistical bases used by individual EU countries   have access to certain statistical procedures and basic statistics.    Commission inspections    The regulation authorises the Commission to appoint officials to carry out its inspections.   Information obtained is subject to professional secrecy and personal data is protected by the national law of the country being inspected as well as relevant EU data protection laws.   Results of inspections carried out by the Commission's agents must be given to the EU country in question within 3 months.    Reports   EU countries are required to:   send the Commission a description of cases of fraud or irregularities concerning traditional own resources involving entitlements exceeding €10,000   submit detailed annual reports to the Commission on their inspections relating to traditional own resources including the results and the overall data.   The Commission produces:   a summary report for the EU countries based on the annual reports they provide   a report to the  Council  and the  European Parliament  every 3 years on the functioning of the inspection arrangements for traditional own resources.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 1 January 2014.   background   For more information, see:    EU budget own resources  (  European Commission  )    The high-level group on own resources  (  European Commission  )   key terms    Balances:  in this instance, the term refers to the calculation of the amount that an EU country receives from and pays into the EU budget.
summary of   Regulation (EC) No 219/2007 setting up a Joint Undertaking to develop the EU's air traffic management system (SESAR)   summary    what does this regulation do   It sets up the SESAR (Single European Sky Air Traffic Management (ATM) Research) project.   SESAR aims to improve ATM performance by modernising and harmonising Europe's ATM systems through the definition, development, validation and deployment of innovative technological and operational ATM solutions.   The  SESAR Joint Undertaking  (JU) is a public-private partnership in charge of the development phase of the SESAR project. It was founded in 2007 by the European Union and  Eurocontrol  , the European organisation for the safety of air navigation.   key points about sesar ju    It is a Joint Undertaking in charge of the development phase of the SESAR project, the technological (research and development — R & D) component of the  Single European Sky  (SES), a package of EU measures designed to meet future capacity and air safety needs.   It is tasked to provide, in accordance with the  ATM master plan  , the EU with a high performance air traffic control infrastructure by 2035. This is to enable safer, more environmentally friendly and efficient air transport: i.e. more direct trips using less fuel and fewer delays.   It involves the European Commission, Eurocontrol, navigation service providers, air passenger organisations, airspace users, regulators, airport operators, airline, airport and air traffic navigation staff, scientists and equipment manufacturers (around 3 000 experts). The JU is a EU body created for this purpose under  Article 187  of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.   It has already delivered an ATM master plan (updated in 2012 and 2015) defining the content, the development and deployment plans for the next generation of ATM systems.   It manages the procedures for the award of grants to its members, in line with the rules for participation in the EU's  Horizon 2020  Framework Programme for R & D, following its extension in 2014.   SESAR JU's achievements to date include:   the world’s first flight in 4 dimensions (3D + time) to enhance end-to-end trajectory information exchange;   an extensive toolkit to increase safety on airport runways and   free routing to reduce flight and fuel emissions.   From 2014 on, SESAR JU's  Research and Innovation  (R & I) programme's focus is on areas such as:   optimised ATM network service;   advanced air traffic services;   high-performing airport operations;   advanced, integrated and rationalised aviation infrastructure.    Funding   The EU's contribution for the SESAR development phase is €700 million under  TEN-T  and  FP7  programmes, complemented by €585 million under the Horizon 2020 programme. In order to take into account the duration of Horizon 2020, all SESAR's calls for proposals must be launched by 31 December 2020.   from when does the regulation apply  It entered into force on 3 March 2007.   background   Council Regulation (EC) No  219/2007  created the SESAR JU. The regulation has been amended twice, in 2008 (  Regulation (EC) No 1361/2008  ) and again in 2014 (  Regulation (EU) No 721/2014  ), when the duration of the SESAR JU was extended until 2024.   act   Council Regulation (EC)  No 219/2007  of 27 February 2007 on the establishment of a Joint Undertaking to develop the new generation European air traffic management system (SESAR) (OJ L 64, 2.3.2007, pp. 1–11)  Successive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 219/2007 have been incorporated in the basic text.

summary of   Directive 2008/96/EC on road infrastructure safety management   what is the aim of the directive  It aims to reduce road deaths and serious injuries on EU road networks by making road infrastructure safer.   key points   Directive 2008/96/EC was amended by Directive (EU)  2019/1936  as part of the  European Commission’s  third  ‘Europe on the Move’ package  .  As amended, the directive requires EU countries to set up and implement procedures relating to:   road safety impact assessments;   road safety audits;   road safety inspection;   network-wide road safety assessments;   exchange of best practices and their continuous improvement.    Scope   The amended directive has an extended scope. It applies to:   roads which are part of the   trans-European road network   , to  motorways  and to other  primary roads  , whether they are at the design stage, under construction or in operation;    other roads  situated outside urban areas, which do not serve properties bordering on them, and which are completed using EU funding, except for roads not open to, or not designed for, general traffic.    Road safety assessment    EU countries must carry out a network-wide road safety assessment,  by 2024  at the latest and  every 5 years subsequently  , on the entire road network in operation covered by the directive. These assessments must assess accident and impact severity risk, based on:   a visual examination, either on site or by electronic means, of the design characteristics of the road; and   an analysis of sections of the road network which have been in operation for more than 3 years and where there have been a large number of serious accidents in proportion to the traffic flow.     Assessment findings must be followed up by targeted  road safety inspections  or, if necessary,  remedial action  .   Periodic road safety inspections must also be made, frequently enough to maintain adequate safety levels for the road infrastructure in question.   The specific needs of vulnerable road users such as  cyclists  and  pedestrians  must be considered systematically in all road safety management procedures.   Safety assessments must be  published  to highlight the safety level of road infrastructures across the EU.    Road markings and road signs    Existing and future procedures for road markings and road signs must focus on  readability and detectability  for human drivers and automated driver assistance systems.   An assessment by a group of experts established by the Commission must, by  June 2021  , assess the opportunity to set  common rules  taking into account:   the interaction between various driver assistance technologies and infrastructure;   the effect of the weather and atmospheric phenomena as well as traffic on road markings and road signs present on EU territory;   the type and frequency of maintenance efforts necessary for various technologies, including an estimate of costs.      Information and transparency    EU countries must notify the Commission of all the motorways and primary roads on their networks, as well as those roads exempt because they have a proven low safety risk, by  17 December 2021  .   The Commission must publish a map of the European road network within the scope of the directive, accessible online, highlighting different categories according to their level of safety.   from when does the directive apply   Directive 2008/96/EU has applied since 19 December 2008 and had to become law in the EU countries by 19 December 2010.   Amending Directive (EU) 2019/1936 has applied since 16 December 2019 and has to become law in the EU countries by 17 December 2021.   background   For further information see:    Road safety — infrastructure  (  European Commission  ).

SUMMARY     This Communication details the future European Union budget for the period 2014-2020 and forms part of the       Europe 2020 strategy      . The proposed budget shall:      fund common policies, such as the         Common Agricultural Policy        (CAP);       assist the weakest regions by applying the principle of solidarity;       complete the internal market;       promote synergies, cooperation and large-scale projects in the fields of research, innovation and justice;       respond to existing and emerging challenges that call for a pan-European approach, such as climate change, demographic change and humanitarian disasters.       A budget for research, innovation and technological development      The EU must be competitive in terms of innovation if it wishes to play a leading role on the world stage. However, it lags behind significantly in terms of innovation and research. In order to catch up, the Commission intends to increase the level of European investment in research and development and bring it to 3 % of GDP.     To this end, the Commission plans to allocate       EUR 80 billion      for the period 2014-2020 to the Common Strategic Framework for Research and Innovation, complemented by the structural funds.      A budget for solidarity for sustainable growth and employment      The EU’s cohesion policy is an expression of solidarity with the most deprived regions. Cohesion policy also plays a significant role in achieving the ambitions and objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy across the EU. The Commission therefore plans to create a new category of region, namely ‘transition regions’, which would include all regions with a GDP per capita between 75 % and 90 % of the EU-27 average.     Furthermore, unemployment and poverty require coordination of national and European actions. For this reason, the       European Social Fund      (ESF) has a significant role to play. Its activities could be complemented by the       PROGRESS programme      and the       EURES      network.     The Commission intends to allocate       EUR 376 billion      to the cohesion policy instruments and to distribute this amount between the different areas as follows:      EUR 162.6 billion for convergence regions;       EUR 38.9 billion for transition regions;       EUR 53.1 billion for competitiveness regions;       EUR 11.7 billion for territorial cooperation;       EUR 68.7 billion for the Cohesion Fund.       A budget for connecting Europe      In order to be fully operational, the single market requires modern infrastructure. For this reason, the Commission proposes the creation of a Connecting Europe Facility in order to promote access to the internal market for all.     The Commission will dedicate       EUR 40 billion      to the creation of the Connecting Europe Facility, along with EUR 10 billion for investment in transport within the Cohesion Fund. This amount will be divided between three different sectors:      EUR 9.1 billion for energy;       EUR 31.6 billion for transport;       EUR 9.1 billion for ICT.       A budget for the Common Agricultural Policy      The CAP must be competitive, ensure an adequate and secure food supply, and preserve the environment and the countryside while providing a fair standard of living for the agricultural community. To achieve these objectives, the Commission wishes to proceed with some changes in order to integrate the CAP into the Europe 2020 strategy. In the future, the budget allocated to agriculture will also support the sustainable management of natural resources and tackling climate change, and will contribute to balanced territorial development throughout Europe.     The Commission intends to keep the       two-pillar structure      of the CAP with a greener and more equitably distributed first pillar and a second pillar that is more focussed on       competitiveness      and innovation, climate change and the environment. It intends to introduce the following changes:      greening of direct payments;       convergence of payments;       capping the level of direct payments.      The Commission proposes to allocate:       EUR 281.8 billion        to the first pillar of the CAP;        EUR 89.9 billion        to rural development.      In addition, an amount of       EUR 15.2 billion      will be distributed between the following sectors:      EUR 4.5 billion for research and innovation;       EUR 2.2 billion for food safety;       EUR 2.5 billion for food support;       EUR 3.5 billion in a new reserve for possible crises in the agricultural sector;       up to EUR 2.5 billion for the         European Globalisation Fund        .       A budget for investing in human resources      The 2020 strategy highlights the need to increase tertiary education in Europe and to reduce early-school leaving, while valuing culture and media activities.     However, the current architecture of the programmes which aim to achieve these objectives is still too fragmented. For this reason, the Commission proposes to establish a       single programme on education, training and youth      .     To this end, the Commission wishes to allocate       EUR 15.2 billion      to education and training, along with       EUR 1.6 billion      for culture. This funding should be complemented by the structural funds.      A budget for responding to the challenges of immigration      Policies relating to security and immigration issues are at the heart of European concerns. Significant changes on how to conduct these policies were introduced under the Lisbon Treaty. For this reason, the Commission wishes to henceforth simplify the structure of the expenditure instruments by reducing the number of programmes to two Funds:      a Migration and Asylum Fund;       an Internal Security Fund.      Furthermore, the Commission intends to allocate       EUR 8.2 billion      to home affairs, and       EUR 455 billion      to civil protection and the European Emergency Response Capacity.      A budget for making the EU a global player      It is important that the EU plays a leading role on the world stage, and that it ensures stability, prosperity and democracy in the countries surrounding it. In particular, the Commission wishes to develop its external strategy by creating a pan-African instrument under the       Development and Cooperation Instrument      (DCI). The EU also wishes to be involved in the process of democratisation in the Arab world.     The Commission does not consider that another major alteration of the legislative architecture applicable to the management of its external relations is necessary. It proposes to allocate       EUR 70 billion      for the external assistance instrument for the period 2014-2020.     And outside the MFF:      European Development Fund (ACP countries): EUR 30 billion;       European Development Fund (overseas countries and territories): EUR 321 billion;       Global Climate and Biodiversity Fund;       Emergency Aid Reserve: EUR 2.5 billion.       Projects requiring funding outside the EU budget      The       European Development Fund      (EDF) is financed outside the EU budget because of its specific status. The same applies to the       ITER      and       European Earth Monitoring programme      (GMES) projects, for which the costs are too high to be included in the EU budget.      A simplified budget      The new budget framework of the EU must meet the need for simplicity. For this reason, the Commission has decided to reduce the number of separate programmes and instruments. Complex programmes which have not been successful will either be redesigned in a simplified and more effective form or discontinued.     Another way to simplify the management of programmes is to put them under a single framework with common rules, keeping any exceptions or specificities to the minimum. For example, the three main sources of funding for research and innovation will be brought together within a single Common Strategic Framework for Research and Innovation. For funds under shared management, a Common Strategic Framework will replace the current approach of establishing separate sets of strategic guidelines for the different instruments.      Executive agencies      are called upon to play a greater role in providing better quality service delivery.     Mindful of the pressures on Member States' budgets and having regard to cut backs in national public administrative expenditure, the Commission proposes a 5 % reduction in the staffing levels of each institution/service, agency or other body.     The Commission also proposes to change the five instruments outside the financial framework, specifically:      the         Emergency Aid Reserve        ;       the         Flexibility Instrument        ;       the         Solidarity Fund        ;       the         Globalisation Adjustment Fund        ;       a new instrument to react to crisis situations in agriculture.       Conclusion      The Commission proposes in accompanying legislative texts a Regulation adopting a new multiannual financial framework, an inter-institutional agreement on budgetary matters and sound financial management, and for a Decision on own resources (with relevant implementing legislation).     In the months to come before the end of 2011, the approach outlined in this Communication will be set out in detail in the legislative proposals for the expenditure programmes and instruments in the individual policy areas.

act   Directive  2008/95/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2008 to approximate the laws of the Member States relating to trade marks (Codified version) (Text with EEA relevance).   summary   This Directive lays down a framework governing trade marks in respect of goods or services which are:   the subject of registration as individual trade marks, collective marks, guarantee or certification marks in an EU country, or in the  Benelux Office for Intellectual Property  ;   the subject of international registration having effect in an EU country.    Signs of which a trade mark may consist   A trade mark may consist of any signs capable of being represented graphically (particularly words, personal names, designs, letters, numerals, the shape of goods or of their packaging) provided that such signs are capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of another.   Grounds for refusal of a trade mark   A trade mark is refused prior to registration, or may subsequently be declared invalid, for the following reasons:   it is not distinctive;   it is descriptive;   it consists of signs which are customary in the current language of the trade in question;   it is contrary to public policy or accepted principles of morality;   it is of such a nature as to mislead the public;   it is contrary to the provisions of Article 6 ter of the  Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property  .   A trade mark is also refused, or may be declared invalid, if it is identical or similar to a trade mark that has been registered previously.  Furthermore, EU countries may provide that a trade mark be refused for registration or be declared invalid where and insofar as the use of the trade mark may be forbidden due to the existence of earlier rights such as:   a right to a name;   a right of personal portrayal;   a copyright;   an industrial property right.   If the proprietor of an earlier trade mark has, for 5 consecutive years, tolerated the use of a trade mark registered later, he may no longer request that it is declared invalid. Nor may he oppose the use of this later trade mark for goods or services for which it was registered, unless the registration of the trade mark was carried out in bad faith.   Rights conferred by a trade mark   The proprietor has an exclusive right to the trade mark that has been created. They may therefore prohibit anyone from using a sign which is identical or so similar as to lead to a risk of confusion in the consumer's mind. However, the proprietor may not limit use of the trade mark in the course of trade, where the following need to be indicated:   a name or address;   features of goods or services covered by the trade mark;   the intended purpose of goods or services.   The trade mark may be the subject of a licence for goods and/or services or a part thereof.   Use of trade marks   The proprietor of a trade mark must make genuine use thereof within 5 years of its registration. Moreover, use may not be interrupted for more than 5 years. If this is not the case, the trade mark shall be subject to sanctions for non-use.  This Directive repeals  Directive 89/104/EC  .

   Cohesion Fund (2007-2013)     Cohesion Fund (2007-2013)     This Regulation establishes a Cohesion Fund to help finance environmental measures and trans-European transport networks in the ten new Member States plus Spain, Greece and Portugal. The Fund is linked to the "Convergence" objective of the reformed cohesion policy for the period 2007-2013.     ACT     Council Regulation of 14 July 2004 (EC) No       1084/2006      of 11 July 2006 establishing a Cohesion Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No       1164/94      [Official Journal L 210 of 31.7.2006].     SUMMARY     During the period 2007-2013, the       general provisions      on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund require the Cohesion Fund to support measures under the "Convergence" objective, the aim of which is to speed up convergence in the Member States and regions whose development is lagging behind by improving conditions for growth and employment.     The ceiling for the Cohesion Fund's contribution to public expenditure co-financed in the Member States is set at 85 %.      Goals      The aim of the Cohesion Fund is to strengthen economic and social cohesion in the European Union (EU) with a view to promoting sustainable development.      Fields of activity      The Cohesion Fund finances action on:      the environment (within the priorities assigned to the Community's environmental protection policy under the policy and action programme         on the environment        . In this context, the Fund may also intervene in areas related to sustainable development and transport outside trans-European networks);       the trans-European transport networks, especially the         priority projects of European interest        .       Restrictions      Cohesion Fund assistance is subject to restrictions, in that the Council may:      decide that there is an excessive government deficit in a beneficiary Member State;       conclude that the Member State concerned has not taken effective action in response to a Council recommendation. The Council may therefore decide to suspend all or part of the commitments from the Fund for the Member State concerned.       Eligible expenditure      Although eligibility is decided at national level, the Regulation states that the following types of expenditure are not eligible for Cohesion Fund financing:      recoverable value-added tax;       interest owed;       land purchases accounting for more than 10 % of total eligible expenditure;       accommodation;       decommissioning of nuclear power stations.       Background      Other provisions relating to cohesion policy for the period 2007-2013 are found in the four specific Regulations on:       general provisions        on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund;       the European Regional Development Fund (         ERDF        );       the         European Social Fund        ;       the European grouping of territorial cooperation (         EGTC        ).      Cohesion policy for the period 2007-2013 is based on the Interinstitutional Agreement and the       Financial Framework for 2007-2013      This Regulation entered into force on 1 August 2006, and Regulation (EC) No       1164/94      was repealed on the same date. The present Regulation must be reviewed by 31 December 2013.

   Green Paper on corporate social responsibility     Green Paper on corporate social responsibility     1) OBJECTIVE     To launch a wide debate on how the European Union could promote corporate social responsibility on a European and International level, in particular, on how to make the most of existing experiences, to encourage the development of innovative practices, to bring greater transparency and to increase reliability in evaluating and validating the various initiatives undertaken in Europe.     2) ACT     Green Paper - Promoting a European framework for Corporate Social Responsibility [       COM(2001) 366      - Not published in the Official Journal].     3) SUMMARY      Background      Corporate social responsibility can make a positive contribution to the strategic goal decided by the Lisbon European Council: "to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world". A European approach to corporate social responsibility forms part of the broader context of various international initiatives, such as the United Nations Global Compact (2000), the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy (1997-2000), or the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (2000). While these initiatives are not legally binding, the European Commission is committed to the active promotion of the OECD guidelines. Observance of the core ILO labour standards (freedom of association, abolition of forced labour, non-discrimination and elimination of child labour) is central to corporate social responsibility.      Corporate social responsibility      Being socially responsible means not only fulfilling the applicable legal obligations, but also going beyond compliance and investing "more" into human capital, the environment and relations with stakeholders. The experience with investment in environmentally responsible technologies and business practices suggests that in going beyond legal compliance companies can increase competitiveness and it can have a direct impact on productivity.     Corporate social responsibility should nevertheless not be seen as a substitute to regulation or legislation concerning social rights or environmental standards, including the development of appropriate new legislation. In countries where such regulations do not exist, efforts should focus on putting the proper regulatory or legislative framework in place in order to define a level playing field on the basis of which socially responsible practices can be developed.     Whilst corporate social responsibility is so far mainly promoted by large or multinational companies, it is relevant in all types of companies and in all sectors of activity, from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to multinationals. Certain SMEs already assume their social responsibility, particularly through community involvement. Worker cooperatives and participation schemes, as well as other forms of cooperative, mutual and associative enterprises structurally integrate other stakeholder interests and take up spontaneous social and civil responsibilities.      Corporate social responsibility: the internal and external dimensions      Under increasing pressure from non-governmental organisations (NGOs), consumer groups and now also investors, companies and sectors are increasingly adopting codes of conduct covering working conditions, human rights and environmental aspects, in particular those of their subcontractors and suppliers. Surveys have shown that consumers not only want to buy good and safe products, but they also want to know if they are produced in a socially responsible manner. In recent years, investors have seen socially responsible investing (SRI) in the social domain and investment in environmental protection as a good indication of sound internal and external management. Socially responsible practices can thus help open the way to reconciling social development with improved competitiveness.     Within the company, socially responsible practices primarily involve investment in human capital, health and safety, and managing change. They also cover environmentally responsible practices relating to the management of the natural resources used in production. In addition to these internal aspects, companies also contribute externally to their local communities, by providing jobs, wages, services and tax revenues. On the other hand companies depend on the health, stability, and prosperity of the communities in which they operate. In this sense, corporate social responsibility involves a wide range of stakeholders: business partners and suppliers, customers, public authorities and NGOs representing local communities, as well as the environment.     In a world of multinational investment and global supply chains, corporate social responsibility must also extend beyond the borders of Europe. One of the external dimensions to corporate social responsibility is that of human rights, particularly in relation to global production activities. Despite the existence of international instruments such as the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, human rights remain a very complex issue presenting political, legal and moral dilemmas.      Integrated management of social responsibility      Companies' approaches in dealing with their responsibilities and relationships with their different stakeholders vary according to sectoral and cultural differences. In general, companies tend to adopt a mission statement, code of conduct, or credo where they state their purpose, core values, and responsibilities towards their stakeholders. These values are then translated into action across the organisation, adding a social or environmental dimension to their plans and budgets in order to carry out social or environmental audits and set up continuing education programmes.     Many multinational companies are now issuing social responsibility reports. While environmental, health, and safety reports are common, reports tackling issues such as human rights or child labour are not. In order for these reports to be useful, a global consensus needs to evolve on the type of information to be disclosed, the reporting format to be used, and the reliability of the evaluation and audit procedures.     The Green Paper invites public authorities at all levels, including international organisations, enterprises from SMEs to multinationals, social partners, NGOs, other stakeholders and all interested individuals to express their views on how to build a partnership for the development of a new framework for the promotion of corporate social responsibility, taking account of the interests of both business and the various stakeholders. Enterprises need to work together with public authorities to find innovative ways of developing corporate social responsibility.      4) implementing measures       5) follow-up work      Last updated: 05.07.2005  
   Rules for direct EU payments to farmers     Rules for direct EU payments to farmers     SUMMARY OF:      Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 — rules for direct payments to farmers under the EU’s common agricultural policy      WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?      It sets out the rules for         direct payments        made to support farmers under the EU’s         common agricultural policy (CAP)        . These payments are made in full on the condition that farmers meet basic standards concerning the environment, climate change, good agricultural and environmental condition of land, public health, animal health, plant health and animal welfare — known as         cross-compliance        . Rules on cross-compliance are laid down in Regulation (EU) No         1306/2013        (see         summary        ).       Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 repeals Regulation (EC) No         73/2009        , which contained the previous rules governing direct payments to farmers that changed following the reform of the CAP in 2013. It also repeals Regulation (EC) No         637/2008        , which related to the cotton sector.       In 2017, the EU adopted Regulation (EU)         2017/2393        , which amends Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 and other legislation relating to the CAP:          Regulation (EU) No             1305/2013            setting up the             European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development            ,           Regulation (EU) No             1306/2013            laying down             financing, managing and monitoring rules for the EU agricultural policy            ,           Regulation (EU) No             1308/2013            on the             common organisation of agricultural markets in the EU            , and           Regulation (EU) No             652/2014            on the             management of expenditure relating to the food chain, animal health and animal welfare            .         In 2020, the EU adopted amending Regulation (EU)         2020/2220        , which lays down certain transitional rules for support from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) in the years 2021 and 2022.      KEY POINTS     Direct payments to farmers are paid through support schemes in each EU country.     EU countries must dedicate a certain proportion of their CAP funding allocation to       compulsory support schemes      , as described below.       Standard per-hectare payments.        To distribute support more fairly, all EU countries had to move towards a uniform payment per hectare from 2015 (a ‘         basic payment        for farmers’).        Green payments per hectare.        To be granted to farmers for observing practices beneficial for the climate and the environment (30% of national funding allocation).        Young farmer per-hectare payment.        For farmers no more than 40 years old, setting up for the first time as head of their farm, up to 5 years before claiming support; this payment is available for up to 5 years.      There are also some       optional support schemes      . EU countries can choose to:      support smaller farms by paying a higher amount on the first hectares (‘         redistributive payment        ’);       grant additional payments for areas with natural constraints;       grant limited amounts of production-related support ('         coupled support        ' — payments linked to specific crops or types of livestock) to help agricultural sectors in their own country that are in difficulty;       offer a simplified scheme for         small farmers        — an annual payment of up to €1,250.      From       1 January 2018      , the new rules contained in amending Regulation (EU) 2017/2393 came into force and include the following.      In principle, only         active farmers        (meaning those whose agricultural activity is not insignificant) could be granted direct support. However, in some EU countries, the administration became too burdensome. In particular, claimants operating airports, railway services, waterworks, real-estate services and permanent sport and recreational grounds were considered inactive except if they proved otherwise. The application of that clause has become voluntary for EU countries.       Some aspects of the rules applying to         green payments        have been simplified, especially for crop-diversification requirements.       An extension of the         permanent grassland        definition:          EU countries may decide to include certain shrubs or trees that produce animal feed in permanent grassland where grasses and other herbaceous forage remain predominant, in the whole or part of their territory;           they may consider land not ploughed up or used for crop rotation for 5 years or more as a criterion for the classification of permanent grassland.          Young farmers        are able to more easily access all 5 years of payments.       EU countries’ responsibilities in regard to the production-limiting nature of         coupled support        are clarified.       The types of         areas of ecological interest for green payments (ecological focus areas)        are extended to cover areas on which plant varieties such as          Miscanthus         and          Silphium perfoliatum         are grown, and also to         land lying fallow        for plants that are beneficial for pollinators.       Transitional rules for the years 2021 and 2022      Amending Regulation (EU) 2020/2220, adopted in December 2020, allows for the continued application of the rules under the 2014-2020 CAP framework and ensures the continuity of payments to farmers and other beneficiaries of support from the EAGF and the EAFRD in 2021 and 2022, until the date of application of the new framework. The aim of the transitional period is to facilitate a smooth transition for beneficiaries to a new programming period.     FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?     Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 has applied since 1 January 2015.     The rules introduced by amending Regulation (EU) 2017/2393 have applied since 1 January 2018.

   Justice Forum     Justice Forum     The aim of this Communication is to create a forum for discussing EU policies and practice in the field of civil and criminal justice. This is a platform for dialogue among specialists (practitioners, representatives of national justice administrations and academics). This forum is also a permanent mechanism for the European institutions to consult stakeholders, with a view to drawing up European policies and reviewing implementation of the instruments in force.     ACT     Communication from the Commission of 4 February 2008 on the creation of a Forum for discussing EU justice policies and practice [       COM(2008) 38      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The Forum aims to:      contribute to dialogue between practitioners by providing a permanent platform. The aim is to facilitate exchanges of views, improve mutual understanding, gradually build up a common judicial culture and strengthen mutual trust between the stakeholders in the field of civil and criminal justice;       collect data and establish best practice. This can be encouraged by means of European funding;       consult practitioners early, i.e. at the stage of European justice policy design. The Forum will provide views on specific action being planned at European Union (EU) level in this field;       draw up views on the overall functioning of European judicial cooperation;       assist the Commission in drawing up its evaluation report on the application of EU measures in domestic legislation. In particular, the Forum provides it with assistance in its task of assessing the transposition of these measures by Member States;       evaluate European policies. This involves assessing the impact of a measure by ensuring that it has achieved its specific objective and contributed to one of the overall objectives associated with the area of freedom, security and justice. It also aims to identify unforeseen consequences of any such measure;       contribute to setting up compatible justice statistics. The Forum has the role of participating in the Commission’s work by giving its opinion on the statistical methods and the data gathered;       take part in the procedure for selecting the winner of the "Crystal Scales of Justice" prize awarded for innovative practice to promote better operation of the system of civil justice. It may also participate in another two-yearly prize which the Commission is considering in respect of criminal justice.      The Forum comprises representatives of:      the Member States;       bodies set up by the EU:         Eurojust        , the         European Judicial Network in criminal matters        and the         European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters        ;       European organisations of various associations or professions: the Eurojustice conference, which brings together the Prosecutors-General, the         European Judicial Training Network        , the Network of Presidents of Supreme Courts of the European Union, the Association of the Councils of State, the European Judges and Prosecutors Association and the European Criminal Bar Association;       non-governmental organisations, such as MEDEL, JUSTICE, Amnesty International and the European Forum for Victim Services;       academic networks, such as the European Criminal Law Academic Network (ECLAN), the International Association of Penal Law (AIDP) and Eurodefensor.      The Forum consists of an annual plenary session and sub-groups. These sub-groups, which meet as often as necessary, are based on specific themes, such as access to legal aid or respect of fair trial rights.     A representative of the Council of Europe is associated with the Forum. In this respect, the Commission specifies that the Forum works in close partnership with one of the bodies of this organisation, the European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ).     In addition, the Commission points out that it is considering setting up an Internet site to:      broadcast the Forum’s findings, work and studies;       form a platform for dialogue between the actors in the criminal justice system.       Background      The creation of this Forum is based on two findings by the Commission:      there is no platform for dialogue between practitioners or channel of communication recognised by the EU institutions for the design of legislation and the evaluation of measures taken by the EU;       judicial circles are in favour of setting up a Justice Forum.

summary of   Regulation (EU) 2018/1724 establishing a single digital gateway to provide access to information, to procedures and to assistance and problem-solving services   what is the aim of the regulation  The  single digital gateway  will facilitate online access to the information, key administrative procedures and assistance and problem-solving services that citizens and businesses may wish to contact if they encounter problems when exercising their  internal market  rights while living in or doing business in another EU country.   key points    A single online point of access to information, procedures and assistance    The single digital gateway will guide citizens and companies to information on national and EU rules, rights and procedures, as well as to the websites where they can carry out these procedures online. Users looking for help will be guided towards assistance and problem-solving services.   In practical terms, a search function on the ‘  Your Europe  ’ portal will give access to:    information  — citizens will be able to easily find reliable, qualitative information on EU and national rules that apply to them when they want to exercise their internal market rights;    procedures  — citizens will find out exactly how to carry out administrative procedures and what steps they need to follow;    assistance  — if users are still confused about which rules apply or if they have trouble with a procedure, they will be guided to the most suitable EU or national assistance service to solve their problem.     The quality, user-friendliness and adequacy of the information provided by the  European Commission  and by authorities in EU countries will be monitored on the basis of user feedback.    Digitised administration    The regulation establishing the gateway also requires that the key administrative procedures be available online to both users in their own country as well as to cross-border users.   By 12 December 2023 at the latest, a list of 21 important administrative procedures will be fully available online in all EU countries. These cover situations that are relevant for doing business, working, studying or moving from one location to another. Examples include:   requesting a proof of residence;   applying for study grants;   asking for academic recognition of diplomas;   registering a vehicle;   getting a  European Health Insurance Card  ;   claiming pension benefits; and   registering employees for pension and insurance schemes.     All national online procedures will have to be made fully accessible to cross-border users.   The ‘once-only principle’ (i.e. users should not have to submit to authorities documents or data already held by other authorities) will be applied to cross-border exchanges of evidence for a range of procedures. For these procedures, users will be given the option to request the direct exchange of evidence between authorities in different EU countries.   In addition, starting in December 2020, users will be able to provide feedback on problems they come across in the single market, with a view to improving policymaking.    Implementation   The functioning of the gateway will be supported by technical tools developed by the Commission in cooperation with national administrations. A gateway coordination group composed of the national coordinators and the Commission will support the regulation’s implementation. The application of the regulation will be reviewed in December 2022 and the functioning of the gateway will be reviewed every 2 years from 2022.   Compliance package   The regulation is part of a compliance package launched in 2017, which also included a  proposal  for a  single market information tool  and improvements to  Solvit  , the free assistance service for the internal market.    Implementing act     In 2020, the Commission adopted Implementing Regulation (EU)  2020/1121  , which sets the rules on collecting and sharing user statistics and feedback on the services of the single digital gateway. The data collected will be used by the service providers, national coordinators and by the Commission to monitor whether the services provided through the gateway comply with the quality criteria and to improve those services and the functionality of the single digital gateway.   Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1121 was accompanied by a  Commission declaration  , which states that it intends to explore, together with the EU countries in the context of the gateway coordination group, the feasibility of and the demand for a common EU-level service managed by the Commission. Another solution could be proposed to facilitate the collection and transmission of statistics related to webpages that are part of the gateway and are under the responsibility of municipal authorities.   from when does the regulation apply  It applies from 12 December 2020. However, articles concerning the digitalisation of procedures, the cross-border availability of procedures and the use of ‘once-only’ system will apply from 12 December 2023. The obligation concerning the availability of information by municipal authorities will apply as of 12 December 2022.   background   See also:    The single digital gateway  (  European Commission  )    Solvit: Solutions to problems with your EU rights  (  European Commission  ).
summary of   Directive 2002/32/EC on undesirable substances in animal feed   summary    what does this directive do   It sets maximum levels for undesirable substances and products* (contaminants) in animal feed (including imports) available on the EU market.   It limits the risks of contamination of animal feed by substances and products that are toxic or adversely affect production.   key points    Scope   The directive applies to all products intended for animal feed, including raw materials for feed, additives and complementary feedingstuffs.  It lays down a list of undesirable substances and specifies the limit values for which the presence of these substances in animal feeds is forbidden (Annex I).  The list includes substances such as certain heavy metals (like lead and cadmium), dioxin and some pesticides. It is regularly updated in the light of scientific and technical knowledge.   Investigations   When these maximum levels are exceeded, EU countries – in cooperation with the businesses concerned – must investigate to identify the sources of the substances. They must inform the  European Commission  of their findings and of any measures taken to eliminate or reduce the level of the substances.   Mixtures   To prevent fraud, the directive bans the mixing (for dilution purposes) of products which exceed the maximum levels.   Provisional measures   Where an EU country can demonstrate that a maximum level fixed for a substance may present a risk to animal or human health or to the environment, it may provisionally introduce more stringent limits until either the  Council  or the Commission takes a decision. The country in question must ensure that its decision is made public.   when does the directive apply  It entered into force on 30 May 2002. EU countries had to incorporate it in national law by 1 May 2003.   background    Animal nutrition — undesirable substances   key term    * Undesirable substance  : any substance or product, with the exception of pathogenic agents, present in and/or on the product intended for animal feed, which presents a potential danger to animal or human health, to the environment or could adversely affect livestock production.   act   Directive  2002/32/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 May 2002 on undesirable substances in animal feed — Council statement (OJ L 140, 30.5.2002, pp. 10-22)  Successive amendments to Directive 2002/32/EC and its Annexes have been incorporated into the original text.

act   Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Towards a thriving data-driven economy (  COM(2014) 442 final  of 2.7.2014).   summary    what does this communication do  The communication is a policy paper with ideas as to how EU countries can exploit data to benefit their economies. Potential benefits of a growing data-driven economy include improved citizen well-being, new business opportunities and more innovative public services.   key points   The main problems identified in public consultations on big data are:        —     lack of cross-border coordination;            —     insufficient infrastructure and funding opportunities;            —     a shortage of data experts and related skills;            —     a complex legal environment.      The Commission puts forward the following ideas to tackle these problems.        —     Create a  big data public-private partnership  that funds major ‘big data’ ideas (e.g. in personalised medicine and food logistics).            —     Create an  open data incubator  to help SMEs set up supply chains based on data and make more use of  cloud computing  (where data are stored and processed in remote data centres).            —     Propose  new rules  on data ownership and liability of data provision for data gathered via machine-to-machine communication (i.e. any technology that enables networked devices to exchange information and perform actions without the manual assistance of humans, for example for remote monitoring. In the area of product restocking, a vending machine can inform the distributor when a particular item is running low).            —     Map existing relevant  data standards  for a number of big data areas (e.g. health, transport, environment, retail, manufacturing, financial services, etc.) to help create a climate of open data exchange.            —     Establish a series of  supercomputing centres of excellence  to increase the number of skilled data workers in Europe (supercomputers are computers that process data at very high speeds).            —     Create a  network of data processing facilities  in different EU countries (these are places where data are processed - an example of a network is the European data network for the research and education community called  Géant  ).      background   Human activities, industrial processes and research are leading to data collection and processing on an unprecedented scale, encouraging the development of new products and services, as well as new business processes and scientific methodologies. The resulting datasets are so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process such ‘big data’ with the current data management tools and methods.  The high levels of growth in data technology and services could deliver considerable economic benefits in various fields, ranging from health, food security, climate issues and resource efficiency to energy and intelligent transport systems.   key terms    Big data  (e.g. geographical information, statistics, weather data, research data, transport data, energy consumption data or health data) refers to large amounts of data produced very quickly by a high number of diverse sources.

acts   Council Regulation (EC) No  215/2008  on the Financial Regulation applicable to the 10th European Development Fund.  Council Decision  2013/759/EU  of 12 December 2013 regarding transitional EDF management measures from 1 January 2014 until the entry into force of the 11th European Development Fund.   summary   The European Development Fund (EDF) is the main instrument for providing Community aid for development cooperation in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States and Overseas countries and territories (OCTs). The 1957 Treaty of Rome made provision for its creation with a view to granting technical and financial assistance, initially to African countries with which some Member States had historical links.  Even though a heading has been reserved for the Fund in the European Union (EU) budget since 1993 following a request by the European Parliament, the EDF does not yet come under the EU general budget. It is funded by the Member States, is subject to its own financial rules and is managed by a specific committee. The aid granted to ACP States and OCTs will continue to be funded by the EDF, at least for the period 2014-2020.  Each EDF is concluded for a period of several years. Since the conclusion of the first partnership convention in 1964, the EDF cycles have generally followed the partnership agreement/convention cycles.   1st EDF: 1959-1964   2nd EDF: 1964-1970 (Yaoundé I Convention)   3rd EDF: 1970-1975 (Yaoundé II Convention)   4th EDF: 1975-1980 (Lomé I Convention)   5th EDF: 1980-1985 (Lomé II Convention)   6th EDF: 1985-1990 (Lomé III Convention)   7th EDF: 1990-1995 (Lomé IV Convention)   8th EDF: 1995-2000 (Lomé IV Convention and the revised Lomé IV)   9th EDF: 2000-2007 (Cotonou Agreement)   10th EDF: 2008-2013 (Revised Cotonou Agreement)   11th EDF: 2014-2020 (Revised Cotonou Agreement).   The Stabex and Sysmin instruments designed to help the agricultural and mining sectors were abolished by the new partnership agreement signed in  Cotonou  in June 2000. This agreement also streamlined the EDF and introduced a system of rolling programming, making for greater flexibility and giving the ACP States greater responsibility.   The 9th EDF  was allocated €13.5 billion for the period 2000-2007. In addition, the unspent balances from previous EDFs total €9.9 billion.  ACP-EC Council of Ministers  Decision No 6/2005  of 22 November 2005 commits €482 million of the conditional 1 billion to the ninth European Development Fund. This amount is allocated as follows: €352 million to support long-term development, €48 million for regional cooperation and integration and €82 million for the investment facility. Furthermore, a second instalment of €250 million for the ACP-EU Water Facility was established by ACP-EC Council of Ministers  Decision No 7/2005  .  The development aid provided by the EDF forms part of a broader European framework. Within the European Union, the funds of the Community's general budget may be used for certain types of aid. Moreover, in addition to managing part of the EDF's resources (loans and risk capital), the European Investment Bank (EIB) will contribute a total of €1.7 billion from own resources for the period covered by the ninth EDF.   The 10th EDF  covered the period from 2008 to 2013 and provided an overall budget of €22,682 million. Of this amount, €21,966 million were allocated to the ACP countries, €286 million to the OCT and €430 million to the Commission as support expenditure for programming and implementation of the EDF. The amount for the ACP countries is divided accordingly: €17, 766 million to the national and regional indicative programmes, €2,700 million to intra-ACP and intra-regional cooperation and €1,500 million to Investment Facilities. An increased share of the budget is devoted to regional programmes, thereby emphasising the importance of regional economic integration as the basic framework for national and local development. An innovation in the 10th EDF was the creation of ‘incentive amounts’ for each country.  The Member States have their own bilateral agreements and implement their own initiatives with developing countries that are not financed by the EDF or any other Community funds.  The  11th EDF  will run between 2014 and 2020: it amounts to €30.5 billion and an additional €2.6 billion will be made available by the European Investment Bank in the form of loans from its own resources.  In June 2013, EU countries reached an internal agreement setting up 11th EDF, including the revised sharing out of contributions between them; this internal agreement still needs to be ratified. Council Decision  2013/759/EU  lays down transitional EDF management measures until the entry into force of the 11th EDF.

   Informing the general public in the event of a radiological emergency     Informing the general public in the event of a radiological emergency     The purpose of this directive is to define common principles with regard to measures and procedures for informing the general public should a nuclear accident occur. It aims to improve the operational health protection of the general public in the event of a radiological emergency     ACT     Council Directive       89/618/Euratom      of 27 November 1989 on informing the general public about health protection measures to be applied and about steps to be taken in the event of a radiological emergency     SUMMARY      Radiological emergency      A radiological emergency could be any of the following situations:      An accident in the territory of a Member State as a result of which a significant release of radioactive material (i.e. exceeding the basic radiation protection standards set out in Directive         96/29/Euratom)        occurs or is likely to occur,       or the detection of abnormal levels of radioactivity which are likely to be detrimental to public health in that Member State.       Accidents covered      The accidents covered by this Directive are those attributable to the following facilities or activities:      any nuclear reactor;       any other nuclear-fuel-cycle facility;       any radioactive-waste management facility;       the transport and storage of nuclear fuels or radioactive wastes;       the manufacture, use, storage, disposal and transport of radioisotopes for agricultural, industrial, medical and related scientific and research purposes;       the use of radioisotopes for power generation in space vehicles.       Population affected      A distinction is made between:      the population likely to be affected, i.e. any population group for which Member States have drawn up intervention plans in the event of a radiological emergency;       the population actually affected, i.e. any population group for which specific protection measures are taken as soon as a radiological emergency occurs.       Informing the public      The population likely to be affected must be informed about the health-protection measures applicable to it and about the action it should take in the event of such an emergency. This advance information shall be communicated to the population without any request being made for it.     As soon as a radiological emergency occurs, the population actually affected must be informed without delay of:      the facts of the emergency,       the steps to be taken,       the health-protection measures applicable to the population in question.      Persons who are not on the staff of the facilities and/or are not engaged in the activities in question, but who might be involved in the organisation of emergency assistance, must be given adequate and regularly updated information on the health risks their intervention might involve and on the precautionary measures to be taken. As soon as a radiological emergency occurs, this information must be supplemented appropriately, having regard to the specific circumstances.

   Croatia – Competition     Croatia – Competition     Candidate countries conduct negotiations with the European Union (EU) in order to prepare themselves for accession. The accession negotiations cover the adoption and implementation of European legislation (       acquis      ) and, more specifically, the priorities identified jointly by the Commission and the candidate countries in the analytical assessment (or ‘screening’) of the EU’s political and legislative       acquis      . Each year, the Commission reviews the progress made by candidates and evaluates the efforts required before their accession. This monitoring is the subject of annual reports presented to the Council and the European Parliament.     ACT     Commission Report [       COM(2010) 660      final – SEC(2010) 1326 – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     The Commission indicates in its       2010 Report      that significant progress has been achieved, particularly to benefit of shipyards. The country must now reform its legislation on cartels and improve the rules of competition in the broadcasting sector and steel and iron industry.      EUROPEAN UNION         ACQUIS        (according to the Commission’s words)      The competition legislation covers both anti-trust and State aid control policies. It includes rules and procedures to fight anti-competitive behaviour by companies (restrictive agreements between undertakings and abuse of dominant position), and to prevent governments from granting state aid which distorts competition in the Internal Market. Generally, the competition rules are directly applicable in the whole Union, and Member States must fully cooperate with the Commission on the enforcement of theses rules.      EVALUATION (according to the Commission’s words)      Significant progress has been achieved in       competition policy      , in particular towards finalisation of the tendering procedure for restructuring the shipyards. Overall, a good level of alignment has been achieved.     However, further efforts are still required to adopt restructuring plans in line with the       State aid      acquis for the shipyards in difficulty, to improve the Croatian Competition Agency’s enforcement record against       cartels      and to improve its administrative capacity further, in particular in the area of antitrust. Alignment of the Croatian Broadcasting Act needs to be completed.     The National Restructuring Plans for the steel industry also need updating.     RELATED ACTS      Commission Report [         COM(2009) 533        final – SEC(2009) 1333 final – Not published in the Official Journal].       Commission Report [         COM(2008) 674        final – SEC(2008) 2694 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The report of November 2008 noted some essential progress as regards State aid in the steel sector. Significant efforts were still required both as regards aid for the restructuring of shipyards, anti-trust and mergers.      Commission Report [         COM(2007) 663        final – SEC(2007) 1431 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The report of November 2007 noted progress in the area of State aid, but that progress in the area of anti-trust, and particularly merger control, remained limited.      Commission Report [         COM(2006) 649        final – SEC(2006) 1385 – Not published in the Official Journal].      The report of November 2006 notes Croatia's progress both as regards anti-trust and State aid, but highlights the work that still remains to be done.      Commission Report [         COM(2005) 561        final – SEC(2005) 1424 - Not published in the Official Journal].      The report of November 2005 noted some progress in the area of competition. However, Croatia should step up its efforts as regards legislative alignment, implementation of legislation and its administrative capacities.      Commission Opinion [         COM(2004) 257        final – Not published in the Official Journal].      In its opinion of April 2004, the European Commission considered that it was essential for Croatia to make considerable and sustained efforts to align its competition legislation with the body of EU legislation and to implement this legislation effectively.

summary of   European Commission communication (COM(2016) 179 final) — EU eGovernment action plan    Article 197 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)    Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union   what is the aim of the communication, the treaty articles and the charter  Since 2005, the  European Commission  has adopted EU  eGovernment  action plans in order to advance the agenda of public sector modernisation across the EU. They aim to support European coordination, collaboration and joint actions on eGovernment.  The latest action plan aims to provide support to administrative processes, improving service quality and increasing efficiency by making full use of digital technology. It also aims to reduce administrative burden on businesses and citizens by making interactions faster, more convenient and cheaper, leading to further economic and social benefits for society as a whole.  Under Article 197 TFEU, the EU may support the efforts of EU countries to improve their administrative capacity to implement EU law.  Under Article 41 of the  Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union  , every person has the right to:   have his or her affairs handled impartially, fairly and within a reasonable time by EU bodies, including the right to be heard before any individual measure which would affect him or her adversely is taken,   have access to his or her file, while respecting the legitimate interests of confidentiality and of professional and business secrecy.   key points   The action plan is guided by the vision that by 2020, public administrations and institutions in the EU should be open, efficient and inclusive, providing borderless, personalised, user-friendly, digital public services to all citizens and businesses.  Innovative approaches are used to design and deliver better services in line with the needs and demands of citizens and businesses. Public administrations use the opportunities offered by the new digital environment to facilitate their interactions with all interested parties and with each other.  This action plan aims to join up the efforts being made to remove existing digital barriers to the  Digital Single Market  . It does not have a dedicated budget, but helps to coordinate resources available to EU countries through various EU programmes. Initiatives within the plan are based on these principles:    Digital by default  , delivering services digitally as the preferred option through a single contact point;    Once-only principle  , ensuring that citizens and businesses supply the same information only once to a public administration;    Inclusive and accessible  : digital public services that are inclusive and cater for different needs such as those of people with disabilities;    Open and transparent  : public bodies sharing information and data between themselves, and citizens and businesses having access to their own data, engaging with businesses and others in service design;    Cross-border  , with digital public services available across borders, preventing further fragmentation and assuring mobility within the EU’s single market;    Interoperable  , with services designed to work seamlessly across the single market and across organisations;    Trustworthy and secure  , with initiatives going further than just legal compliance on data protection, privacy, and IT security.   The  20-point action plan  is organised in 3 pillars, and gives a  target date  for each action to be completed.    Pillar I: Modernising public administration with ICT    Actions in this pillar aim to  improve efficiency and effectiveness of public administrations  , still crucial in the current economic climate and context of budget austerity, by using key digital tools:  1. In 2019: support the transition of EU countries towards full  e-procurement  and use of contract registers.  2. In 2016: accelerate the take-up of  eIDAS  services.  3. In 2018: ensure the sustainability of digital services infrastructure across borders.  4. In 2016-2019: present a revised version of the  European Interoperability Framework (EIF)  and support take-up by EU countries.  5. In 2017: coordinate the development of a prototype for a European Catalogue of ICT standards for public procurement.  6. In 2016-2019: gradually introduce the ‘digital by default’ and ‘once-only’ principles,  e-invoicing  and e-procurement and assess possible implementation of the ‘no legacy’ principle.    Pillar II: Enabling cross-border mobility with digital public services    The past years of benchmarking, eGovernment show intra-EU services lagging significantly behind national services and that the availability and quality of services on offer to non-residents is inadequate. Studying in another country, for instance, may still include paper application processes and face-to-face meetings before enrollment.  Actions in this pillar aim to facilitate  mobility and access to digital public services across borders  for citizens and businesses in an interoperable EU:  7. In 2017: submit a proposal for a  Single Digital Gateway  .  8. In 2016: make the  European e-Justice Portal  a one-stop information shop.  9. In 2017: mandatory interconnection of all EU countries’ business registers.  10. In 2019: further develop the electronic interconnection of insolvency registers.  11. In 2017: present an initiative for digital solutions throughout a company’s life-cycle.  12. In 2016: extend the  Single Electronic Mechanism  for registration and payment of VAT.  13. In 2016: launch a pilot on the  Once-Only Principle  for business.  14. In 2018: establish a single reporting mechanism in maritime transport and digitalise transport e-documents.  15. In 2019: complete the setup of the  Electronic Exchange of Social Security Information  .  16. In 2017: further develop the  EURES European Job Mobility Portal  .  17. In 2016-2018: support EU countries to develop eHealth services across borders.    Pillar III: Facilitating digital interaction with citizens and businesses    Actions in this pillar aim to  improve the take-up of digital public services  by citizens and businesses. This is meant to improve the user experience through, for example, personalisation, while respecting privacy and data protection. This may be achieved by engaging users themselves in the design, production and delivery of public services.  Some of the most impactful actions include the roll-out of electronic identification and trust services (  eIDAS services  ), the implementation of the once-only principle and re-use of the  digital service infrastructure building blocks  for cross-border public services. Some actions specifically address the Commission’s own digital transformation.  Actions in this pillar include:  18. In 2019: assess applying the once-only principle for citizens across borders.  19. In 2016-2020: accelerate use of the  INSPIRE Directive  data infrastructure.  20. In 2018: transform EU websites to encourage participation of citizens and businesses in programmes and policy.  Further actions may be needed to achieve these objectives, and to adapt to the rapidly changing technological environment.  The Commission has also set up an  eGovernment Action Plan Steering Board  , composed of EU country representatives, to coordinate the effective implementation and monitoring of the Action Plan as well as assess and select new actions.  Although the plan will not have its own dedicated budget, it will receive funding from various EU programmes. Where the funding comes from the EU’s  structural and investment funds  , the funding is conditional on the countries in question complying with the EU’s  economic governance procedures  .   background   The digital transformation of government facilitates businesses’ interaction with public administrations across the EU, so they can easily tap into new markets. It also reduces the administrative burden for citizens who want to live, work, study or retire in another EU country.  Digital public services are crucial to reducing administrative burdens on citizens and businesses by making their interactions with public authorities faster, more convenient and less costly.  The eGovernment Action Plan 2016-2020 aims to address the problems faced by citizens, businesses and public administrations through the strategic objectives set out in the  Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe  :    1.    modernise public administration;      2.    achieve cross-border interoperability; and      3.    facilitate easy interaction with citizens.      Dynamic Action Plan   The mid-term evaluation of the eGovernment Action Plan 2011-2015 recommended that the current Action Plan move away from being a 5-year, static initiative to a more flexible and iterative approach. The dynamically evolving eGovernment Action Plan is supported by a digital engagement platform is called  eGovernment4EU  . It collects concrete ideas for action from all interested parties.In the Digital Single Market Midterm Review 5, new actions were already added to the Action Plan, but new actions can still be added to the Action Plan.   Beyond the Action Plan   The 2017 Tallinn Ministerial Declaration on eGovernment represents a strong political commitment by European countries (from the EU and EFTA) to further accelerate the digital transformation of government in line with the principles of the eGovernment Action Plan. While it recognises the role of the EU’s 2016 eGovernment Action Plan in this transformation, it calls for laying the basis for further digital evolution and joint actions beyond 2020 by spreading digitisation across all policy areas and ensuring end-users are the focus of services.

summary of   Directive 2013/48/EU — right of access to a lawyer, to contact with third parties and consular authorities in the event of custody   what is the aim of the directive  It aims to ensure that suspects and accused persons in criminal proceedings and requested persons in  European arrest warrant  proceedings (hereafter ‘citizens’) have access to a lawyer and have the right to communicate while deprived of their liberty.   key points    Right of access to a lawyer   Citizens must have access to a lawyer  without undue delay  :   before they are questioned by a law enforcement (e.g. the police) or judicial authority;   during an investigative or other evidence-gathering act (e.g. confrontation);   from the moment of deprivation of liberty;   in due time before they appear before a criminal court.   More specifically, the law covers:   the right to  meet in private  and to  communicate  with a lawyer;   the right for the lawyer to  participate effectively  when the person is questioned, and to attend the investigative and evidence-gathering acts;   the  confidentiality  of all forms of communication (meetings, correspondence, telephone conversations, etc.).   As regards persons subject to a  European arrest warrant  , the directive lays down the right of access to a lawyer in the executing EU country and to appoint a lawyer in the issuing country.   Rights in the event of deprivation of liberty   Citizens deprived of liberty have the right, without undue delay:   to have at least  1 person of their choice informed  of their deprivation of liberty. If the arrested person is a child, the holder of parental responsibility should be informed as soon as possible;   to  communicate  with at least 1 person of their choice.   If they are deprived of liberty in an EU country other than their own, they have the right to inform their  consular authorities  , to be visited by them, to communicate with them and to have legal representation arranged for by them.   Exceptions   The directive allows for the possibility to derogate temporarily from certain rights in exceptional circumstances and under strictly defined conditions (for example, where there is an urgent need to avert serious adverse consequences for the life, liberty or physical integrity of a person).   Legal aid   Directive (EU)  2016/1919  sets out common minimum rules concerning the right to legal aid for suspects, accused persons and requested persons ensuring the effectiveness of Directive (EU) 2013/48. It requires EU countries to ensure that suspects and accused persons who lack sufficient resources to pay for the assistance of a lawyer have the right to legal aid when the interests of justice so require. EU countries may apply a  means test  (to assess if the person lacks sufficient resources to pay for legal assistance), a  merits test  (to assess whether providing legal aid would be in the interest of justice ), or both to determine whether legal aid is to be granted.  Directive (EU) 2016/1919 is the last legal text planned as part the  roadmap for strengthening procedural rights  of suspected or accused persons in criminal proceedings adopted by the Council in November 2009.  This directive has to become law in the EU countries by 5 May 2019.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 26 November 2013 and had to become law in the EU countries by 27 November 2016.   background   For more information, see:    Rights of suspects and accused  (  European Commission  ).
summary of   Regulation (EU) No 996/2010 — investigation and prevention of accidents and incidents in civil aviation   what is the aim of the regulation   It aims to improve aviation safety by ensuring a high level of efficiency, expediency, and quality of European civil aviation safety investigations.   It lays down rules concerning the timely availability of information relating to all persons and dangerous goods on board an aircraft involved in an accident.   It also aims to improve the assistance to the victims of air accidents and their relatives.   key points    Scope    This regulation applies to safety investigations into accidents  *  and serious incidents  *  :   which occur in the territories of European Union (EU) countries;   which occur outside the territories of the EU countries but involve aircraft registered in an EU country or which are operated by a company established in an EU country;   in which an EU country is entitled (according to international standards and recommended practices) to appoint an accredited representative to participate in the investigation;   in which an EU country — having special interest by virtue of fatalities or serious injuries to its citizens — is permitted by the country conducting the investigation to appoint an expert.     The regulation does not apply to safety investigations into accidents and serious incidents which involve aircraft engaged in military, customs, police or similar services.    Independent safety investigation authorities (SIAs)    Each EU country must ensure that safety investigations into civil aviation accidents and serious incidents are conducted, without external interference, by a permanent national civil aviation safety investigation authority (SIA).   Each SIA must be functionally independent from any authority or of any other party which could conflict with its tasks or influence its objectivity.   Each SIA must be capable of independently conducting a full safety investigation. EU countries must provide their respective SIAs with the means and finances — including a budget — to carry out their responsibilities independently and have access to sufficient resources.   In particular, the SIA must have at its disposal qualified personnel and adequate facilities including offices and hangars to store and examine the aircraft, its contents and its wreckage.    Obligation to investigate    Every accident or serious incident involving aircraft other than those specified in Annex II to  Regulation (EC) No 216/2008  must be the subject of investigation in the EU country of the territory of which it occurred.   SIAs may decide to investigate incidents other than the ones referred in the above paragraph, as well as accidents and serious incidents to other types of aircraft, when they expect to draw safety lessons from them.   In no event may safety investigations be concerned with apportioning blame or liability. They must be independent of, separate from and without prejudice to any judicial or administrative proceedings to apportion blame or liability.    Cooperation between safety investigation authorities   The regulation allows for cooperation between SIAs as well as for the possibility of delegating tasks.   European Network of Civil Investigation Authorities (ENCASIA)   EU countries must ensure that their SIAs establish among themselves a  European Network of Civil Aviation Safety Investigation Authorities  (ENCASIA) to:   further improve the quality of the investigations conducted by SIAs and to strengthen their independence;   encourage high standards in investigation methods and investigator training.    Investigation    Notwithstanding any judicial investigation, the investigator-in-charge has the authority to take the necessary measures to satisfy the requirements of the safety investigation. Among other things, the investigator is entitled to:   have immediate unrestricted and unhampered  access to the accident or incident site  as well as to the aircraft, its contents or wreckage;   require that  evidence is collected  and debris or components are removed for analysis;    request autopsies  and the  medical examination  of the people involved in the operation of the aircraft;    call witnesses  and require them to give evidence.     The EU country in the territory of which an accident or serious incident occurred is responsible for ensuring safe treatment and protection of all evidence.    Coordination with other authorities    EU countries must ensure that SIAs and other authorities (e.g. judicial, civil aviation, search and rescue involved in the safety investigation) cooperate with each other via advanced arrangements, providing that those arrangements do not compromise SIAs’ independence.   EU countries must communicate these arrangements to the  European Commission  , which has to transmit them to the ENCASIA Chairman, the  European Parliament  and the  Council of the European Union  .    Confidentiality and appropriate use of information    The regulation establishes a list of records that must not be made available or used for purposes other than safety investigation (e.g. Flight Data Recorder data, draft reports, identity of persons who have given evidence, notes of investigators).   Rules in the regulation on confidential use of information, including information, such as serial and registration numbers, which directly identify aircraft subject to an occurrence report, are amended by Regulation (EU) No  376/2014  . The regulation also recognises that the administration of justice or the authority competent may decide on the disclosure of records according to the national law. EU countries may decide to limit the cases in which such a decision of disclosure may be taken, while respecting EU legal acts.    Assistance for victims and relatives    EU countries must each put in place a national civil aviation accident  emergency plan  with provisions for assistance to victims of accidents and their relatives. They must also ensure that airlines have their own plan to help victims and their relatives, taking particular account of  psychological support  .   EU countries should also encourage non-EU airlines operating within the EU to adopt a similar plan.   Each EU country concerned by an accident must appoint a person as a  point of contact  and information for victims and relatives.   Airlines must offer travellers the opportunity to give the contact data of a person to be contacted in the event of an accident. The name of a person on board must not be made public before the relatives of that person have been informed.    Report and safety recommendations    During the investigation the safety authority will recommend any  prompt action  it considers necessary to enhance aviation safety to persons responsible for aircraft or aircraft equipment manufacture or maintenance, and to aircraft operators or for personnel training.   The investigation concludes with a report containing  safety recommendations  after final consultations with the authorities concerned, including the European Aviation Safety Agency. The final report is published in the shortest possible time, if possible within 12 months of the date of accident or incident. The authority will also record responses to its recommendations.   Each party receiving a safety recommendation, including the safety authorities at national and EU level, must also  monitor the progress  of the action taken in response to the safety recommendations received.   The regulation repeals Directive  94/56/EC  .   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 2 December 2010.   background   For more information, see:    ‘Civil Aviation Accident and Incident Investigations’  on the European Commission's website   * key terms     accident:  an occurence associated with the operation of an aircraft which takes place between the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight and all such persons have disembarked, and in which any person suffers death or serious injury, or in which the aircraft receives substantial damage.     incident:  an occurrence, other than an accident, associated with the operation of an aircraft which affects or could affect the safety of operations.
summary of   European Commission communication (COM(2010) 389 final) - towards a European road safety area 2011-2020   what does this european commission communication do  Although progress was made on road safety in the European Union (EU) during the 3rd European road safety action programme (RSAP) which ran between 2003 and 2010), the  European Commission  highlights that efforts to improve road safety need to be further strengthened.   key points   The European road safety policy orientations (2011-2020) aim to provide a general framework and challenging objectives to guide national and local strategies, in accordance with the  principle of subsidiarity  . Within the general framework, the Commission highlights the need to:   create a cooperation framework based on the  exchange of best practices  across the EU;   adopt a strategy for injuries and first aid to address the need to  reduce  the number of  road injuries  ;   improve the  safety  of  vulnerable road users  .    Principles and target   The Commission sets out  3 main principles  :    striving for the highest road safety standards throughout Europe  - by encouraging EU citizens to take primary responsibility for their own safety and the safety of others on EU roads, and by focusing on improving the safety of more vulnerable road users;    an integrated approach to road safety  - through cooperation with other EU policy areas, such as energy, environment, education, innovation and technology, and justice.    subsidiarity, proportionality and shared responsibility  - through the concept of shared responsibility, commitment and practical actions at all levels from EU countries and their authorities to regional and local bodies.   Following the RSAP 2003-10, the Commission proposes to maintain the  target  of  halving the overall number of road deaths  in the EU between 2010 and 2020. This demonstrates the EU’s clear commitment to road safety and having a common objective is intended to provide EU citizens with a more uniform level of road safety within the EU. The Commission encourages individual EU countries to contribute to the achievement of this common target through their own national road safety strategies.  During the public consultation for these policy orientations, which took place between July and December 2009, a target for reducing road traffic severe injuries was proposed. Once a common definition exists for  ‘severe injuries’  , the Commission is to add a common  ‘injuries reduction target’  to these European road safety policy orientations up to 2020.   Strategic objectives   The Commission has identified 7 objectives, for which actions will be proposed at both EU and national level:    improve education and training of road users  - the quality of the licensing and training system needs to be improved, with emphasis on  young drivers  The Commission will work with EU countries to develop a common educational and training road safety strategy including pre-test learning, the driving licence test, and post-licence training;    increase enforcement of road rules  - the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council will work together to establish a  cross-border exchange of information  in the area of road safety. The Commission will also work towards a  common road safety enforcement strategy  which will involve enforcement campaigns, national enforcement objectives, and vehicle technology to assist enforcement, including the possibility of  speed limiters  in light commercial vehicles and  alcohol interlock devices  ;    safer road infrastructure  - the Commission will ensure that EU funds will only be granted to  infrastructure  that complies with EU safety requirements. The Commission will also promote the application of the relevant principles of safe management to the secondary road network of EU countries, in particular through the exchange of best practices.    safer vehicles  - as well as continue to encourage the progress of  vehicle safety  , the Commission will also evaluate and propose actions in the area of harmonisation and progressive strengthening of EU legislation on  roadworthiness tests  and on technical  roadside inspections  ;    promote the use of modern technology to increase road safety  - the Commission will continue to promote the use of  Intelligent Transport Systems  to improve road traffic safety. The effectiveness and speed of rescue will be enhanced by the adoption of the European emergency call service fitted to vehicles,  ‘eCall’  ;    improve emergency and post-injuries services  - the Commission will propose the establishment of a global strategy of action on road injuries and first aid. The Commission will in particular examine the means to improve the efficiency of first aid intervention and post-care handling in order to reduce the impact of road accidents.    protect vulnerable road users  - the Commission will work to improve the safety of  motorcyclists  , addressing  behaviour  , as well as vehicle and infrastructure safety. It will also encourage the establishment of adequate infrastructures to increase the safety of  cycling  and other vulnerable road users.    Implementation of the European road safety policy orientations 2011-20   Open cooperation between EU countries and the Commission facilitates the implementation of the EU road safety policy. Parallel to this, EU countries also have  national road safety plans  that include specific national objectives which are individual to their particular situation.  The Commission will pursue the improvement of the existing tools for data collection and analysis, such as CARE, the EU database on road accidents established in accordance with  Council Decision 93/704/EC  , as well as the  European Road Safety Observatory  (ERSO), which makes publicly available through the Internet road safety data and knowledge at European level.   background   For more information, see  Road safety  on the European Commission’s website   act   Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - Towards a European road safety area: policy orientations on road safety 2011-2020 (  COM(2010) 389 final  of 20 July 2010)

   Seventh Framework Programme (2007 to 2013)     Seventh Framework Programme (2007 to 2013)     Research is a component of a knowledge triangle (the other two being education and innovation) meant to boost growth and employment in the European Union (EU) in the context of a global economy. The 7th Framework Programme for Research, covering the period 2007 to 2013, is an opportunity for the EU to match its research policy to its ambitions in terms of economic and social policy by consolidating the European Research Area (ERA). In order to achieve this objective, the Commission hopes to increase the EU's annual spending on research, thereby generating more national and private investment in this field. When it is implemented, the 7th Framework Programme will also have to respond to the research and knowledge needs of industry and more generally of EU policies. The Framework Programme is organised around four main programmes and has been greatly simplified so as to be more effective and more accessible to researchers.     ACTS     Decision No       1982/2006/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (2007-13).     Council Decision       969/2006/EC      of 18 December 2006 concerning the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) or nuclear research and training activities (2007-11).     SUMMARY     The 7th Framework Programme is adapted to the EU’s needs in terms of growth and employment. After wide-ranging public consultation, four main objectives have been identified, which correspond to the four specific programmes around which the European research effort is to be structured.      Four main specific programmes      The       Cooperation      Programme aims to stimulate cooperation and improve links between industry and research within a transnational framework. The aim is for Europe to gain and consolidate leadership in key research areas. The programme will have nine themes, which are to be managed autonomously but will be complementary in terms of implementation:      health;       food, agriculture and biotechnology;       information and communication technologies;       nanosciences, nanotechnologies, materials and new production technologies;       energy;       environment (including climate change);       transport (including aeronautics);       socio-economic sciences and the humanities;       security and space.      The       Ideas      Programme is intended to enhance exploratory research in Europe, i.e. aimed at discovering new knowledge that fundamentally changes our vision of the world and our way of life. In order to achieve this, the new European Research Council will support the most ambitious and innovative research projects. Within this new structure, at the forefront of European research, there will be an autonomous Scientific Council, which will identify priorities and scientific strategies. The aim is to enhance European research excellence by promoting competition and risk-taking.     The       People      Programme will harness significant financial resources that can be used to improve the career prospects of researchers in Europe and attract more high-quality young researchers. The Commission hopes to encourage training and mobility so that European researchers can realise their full potential. The programme will reinforce the existing "Marie Curie" actions, which for several years have been offering mobility and training opportunities to European researchers.     The       Capacities      Programme is intended to give researchers powerful tools that will enable them to enhance the quality and competitiveness of European research. This means more investment in research infrastructure in the less successful regions, in the creation of regional research-driven clusters and in research for the benefit of SMEs. This programme also has to reflect the importance of international cooperation in research and the role of science in society.     Furthermore, the 7th Framework Programme will finance the direct actions of the       Joint Research Centre (JRC)      and the actions covered by the       Euratom Framework Programme      in the fields of:      research into fusion energy;       nuclear fission and radiation protection.       Change in the duration of the programme      The 7th Framework Programme takes over many features from previous programmes that have had a positive effect on European research. This is the case with the projects run by European partner groups, which will continue to have a central role in the Framework Programme. Similarly, the Commission places the Framework Programme within the context of the European Research Area, which brings together all of the EU's activities in this field. The extension of the programme from four to seven years is indicative of the EU’s sustained commitment to stimulating European research.     While preserving the best aspects of the previous programmes, the 7th Framework Programme introduces new measures designed to improve the coherence and effectiveness of the EU’s research policy. The main innovations introduced in this framework programme are:      simplification of the procedures for participation in the programme;       implementation of the programme and its budget by theme instead of by instrument, so that it may function more coherently and effectively;       creation of the European Research Council under the Ideas Programme to support exploratory research;       improved cooperation with industry via the Joint Technology Initiatives, which will combine private investment and public funding;       the support of a European research infrastructures policy;       creation of a Risk Sharing Finance Facility to make it easier for participants to access European Investment Bank loans.      As was the case during the       Sixth Framework Programme      , several research areas will       not      receive Community financing:      reproductive human cloning       research aiming to alter human genetic stock such that modifications become heritable;       research aiming to create human embryos solely for research purposes or for stem cell procurement.       A simplified Framework Programme      Since 1984, various framework programmes have increased the number of administrative and financial procedures which govern the EU's research effort. The Commission hopes to continue the process of simplification launched under the previous framework programme, thereby making the financing and management of research projects more effective.     Specific measures designed to simplify the framework programme’s implementation include:      streamlining of funding schemes and a more limited choice of instruments for more coherent funding;       use of simpler and less bureaucratic language in order to be more comprehensible to the general public;       reduction in the number and size of official documents;       simplification of the procedures participants have to go through;       reduction in the number of preliminary checks prior to the adoption of a project;       greater autonomy for partner groups;       simplification of the selection procedure for projects.       A budget that is large but necessary      The Commission is proposing a budget of EUR 50 521 million for the period of 2007-13, i.e. an average of EUR 7 217 per annum. This total is in fact one and a half times that of the annual budget of the 6th Framework Programme, set at EUR 4 375 per annum, i.e. a total of EUR 17 500 million over four years). The budget will be broken down as follows:      Cooperation: EUR 32 413 million.       Ideas: EUR 7 513 million.       People: EUR 4 750 million.       Capacities: EUR 4 097 million.       Non-nuclear actions taken by the JRC: EUR 1 751 million.       Euratom: EUR 2 700 million (2007-11).      This increase reflects the importance of research in the       relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy      , which aims to make Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge economy in the world. Recently, Europe has missed big opportunities in certain key areas due to a lack of available funds. This Framework Programme will make it possible to finance more quality projects and enhance the EU’s innovation capacity.     Knowledge and technology are Europe’s main advantages and represent the foundation for growth and employment. The Framework Programme is intended to have a leverage effect on national research spending, in order to achieve the objective of spending 3 % of GDP on research in Europe. The Commission intends to play a central role in driving and coordinating European research, so that knowledge is placed at the service of growth and employment in Europe.      Background      Since 1984, the EU has run its research and technological development policy on the basis of multiannual framework programmes. The 7th Framework Programme is the second since the launching of the       Lisbon Strategy      in 2000 and should play a fundamental role in growth and employment in Europe in years to come. The Commission wants to develop the knowledge triangle formed by research, education and innovation policies, in order to place knowledge at the service of a dynamic economy and social and environmental progress.

The 7th Framework Programme is adapting to help the EU meet its goals of creating a low carbon, knowledge-based society. It seeks to increase public and private R&D investment and to diversify its instruments in order to maximise European added value.     FP7 is crucial in promoting scientific excellence and technological. Its role is even more important now given the current economic situation. FP7 contributes to sustained research efforts, both private and public, as exemplified in the public private partnership initiatives for green cars, energy efficient buildings and factories of the future launched as part of the European Recovery Plan.     The Commission has requested a group of experts to carry out an interim evaluation of FP7 in order to improve its impact on shaping the European Research Area. The conclusions from this evaluation will feed into the debates on the future financial frameworks of the European Union, the post-2010 Lisbon Strategy and the next Framework Programme.

summary of   Regulation (EU) 2019/125 on trade in certain goods which could be used for capital punishment, torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment   what is the aim of the regulation   It requires EU countries’ authorities to distinguish between goods that have no practical use other than carrying out capital punishment or torture  *  and goods that could be used for such purposes.   It bans trade in goods which can be used for the purpose of capital punishment, torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment  *  .   It sets out an  authorisation system  designed to prevent the export of goods that  could   be used  for such purposes.   It introduces rules governing the supply of brokering services  *  , technical assistance  *  , training and advertising related to such goods.   It  codifies  Regulation (EC) No  1236/2005  which had been substantially amended several times.   key points    Prohibitions   The regulation  bans  :   exports and imports of goods which have  no practical use  other than for the purpose of  capital punishment  or for the purpose of  torture  and other  cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (Annex II)  ;   the supply of  technical assistance  in respect of such goods;    brokers and suppliers  of technical assistance from providing training on the use of such goods to non-EU countries; as well as both   the  promotion of such goods  in trade fairs or exhibitions in the EU, and   the  sale or purchase  of  advertising space  in print media or on the Internet, and of  advertising time  on television or radio, in relation to such goods.      Export authorisations   The regulation sets out the rules for the issue of  export authorisations  .    Annex I  lists the EU countries’  competent authorities  permitted to issue such authorisations. Competent authorities must not grant an authorisation if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the goods could be used for the above purposes. No authorisation is required for goods that only pass through the EU’s customs territory.   Goods that could be  used for the purpose of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment  are listed in  Annex III  .   Annex III  does not  include:    firearms  controlled by Regulation (EU) No 258/2012;    dual-use items  controlled by Regulation (EC) No 428/2009;   goods controlled in accordance with Common Position  2008/944/CFSP  .     Goods that could be  used for the purpose of   capital punishment  and have been approved or actually used for capital punishment by one or more non-EU countries that have not abolished capital punishment are listed in  Annex IV  . The conditions and requirements for the issue of an EU ‘  General Export Authorisation  ’ are set out in  Part 3 of Annex V  .  Part 2 of the same annex  lists  destination   countries  for which export authorisations are  not required  .   Authorisations for  export, import or transit  of  goods that could be used for torture  must be issued on a form based on the model set out in  Annex VII  .   Authorisations concerning  brokering services  must be issued on a form based on the model set out in  Annex VIII  .   Authorisations concerning  technical assistance  must be issued on a form based on the model set out in  Annex IX  .   All such authorisations are valid throughout the EU.   EU countries’ authorities  may refuse to grant an export authorisation  and  cancel, suspend, amend or withdraw  an authorisation that has already been granted.   If an authorisation is not granted, the  customs authorities  keep the goods declared and draw attention to the option of applying for an authorisation. The goods are destroyed after 6 months if they have not received a request for authorisation.   If there is a  decision rejecting a request for authorisation  , an EU country’s authorities must notify  all other EU countries  and the  European Commission  .   The Commission may  amend the lists of goods  as soon as new equipment or substances appears on the market.   EU countries must draw up annual activity reports.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 20 February 2019. Regulation (EU) 2019/125  codifies  and replaces Regulation (EC) No  1236/2005  and its subsequent amendments.   background    The absolute ban on  torture and ill-treatment  enshrined in core  United Nations human rights conventions  is reflected at EU level in the  Charter of Fundamental Rights  , which states that ‘no one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’. In 2012, the Council approved ‘  Guidelines to EU policy towards third countries on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (An up-date of the Guidelines)  ’.   The charter also prohibits  capital punishment  . The Charter also states that ‘no one shall be condemned to the death penalty or executed’. In April 2013, the Council approved ‘  EU Guidelines on death penalty  ’.   For more information, see:    Anti-torture measures  (  European Commission  ).     key terms    Torture:  any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from that person or from a third person information or a confession, punishing that person for an act that either that person or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing that person or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted either by or at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of, a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not, however, include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to, lawful penalties. Capital punishment is not deemed a lawful penalty under any circumstances.   Other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment:  any act by which pain or suffering attaining a minimum level of severity, whether physical or mental, is inflicted on a person, when such pain or suffering is inflicted either by or at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of, a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not, however, include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to, lawful penalties. Capital punishment is not deemed a lawful penalty under any circumstances.

   Fair trade     Fair trade     This Communication aims to launch the process for the development of the Community's position on fair trade.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council of 29 November 1999 on 'fair trade' [       COM(1999) 619      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY      Background      The promotion of fair trade comes under the framework of the Community's broader objectives in relation to development cooperation, in other words the fight against poverty, economic and social development and, in particular, the gradual integration of developing countries into the world economy.     Trade has a fundamental role to play in the creation of wealth and thus development. This communication is a first stage in the development of the Community's position on this matter.      Definition of fair trade      The concept of fair trade applies in general to trade operations which strengthen the economic position of small-scale producers and landowners in order to ensure that they are not marginalised in the world economy. It mainly relates to developing countries and, under the present communication, covers two main aspects:      ensuring that producers, including employees, receive a share of the total profit commensurate with their input;       improving social conditions, particularly those of employees in the absence of developed structures for social services and worker representation (trade union representation for instance), etc.;      This concept has long-term development in mind. Participation in initiatives on fair trade is voluntary for both sellers and consumers.     It is important to note that the concept of 'fair trade' is not the same as that of 'ethical trade'. 'Ethical trade' usually relates to the operating methods of companies present in the country (codes of conduct, for example).      Fair trade in practice      Fair trade goods are always made available to consumers through private initiatives. The practical implementation of fair trade has changed considerably over the years.      The traditional fair trade movement      The concept was originally developed by non-governmental organisations (NGOs). The philosophy is based upon precise principles and was originally applied by alternative trading organisations often started by churches, charities, etc. The organisations are involved in every stage (sourcing, production, etc.) and the profits are often devoted to development causes. The products are not always labelled.      Labelling initiatives      Since the end of the 1980s, normal commercial companies (supermarkets, etc.) have been more likely to be involved in fair trade initiatives and the products are marketed according to the usual rules.     In this regard, systems for labelling products were introduced in order to ensure their authenticity. There are several fair trade labels ('Fairtrade Mark', etc.) and each has a certification agency which verifies all the stages in the production process to ensure that the product respects fair trade principles. The certification bodies also set the criteria that must be respected in order for a product to carry a fair trade label. These criteria are harmonised at international level. All the labels are members of the FLO (Fair Trade Labelling Organisations International) which is responsible for coordination at EU and international level.     Producers and importers who have been assessed as complying with the fair trade criteria are included in international fair trade registers. Fair trade labelling schemes are financed by licence fees paid by importers and traders. These fees are related to turnover and volume of sales.      European Union and fair trade      Fair trade accounts for a relatively substantial proportion of consumption in Europe. In 1997, the turnover in the EU of fair trade products was estimated to be in the region of EUR 200 to 250 million. Overall, 11% of the EU population buy fair trade products and surveys show that there is high demand for such products.     The EU has already implemented initiatives concerning fair trade, including European Parliament resolutions and financing of NGOs, labelling bodies and projects in developing countries. With regard to legislation, the Union implements these principles through various instruments, particularly measures concerning the EU's generalised system of preferences. Some of these regulations on fair trade benefit fair trade goods by facilitating their access to the Community market.      International community      The international community has recognised the important role played by fair trade in the development of poorer countries. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) has concluded that initiatives in this field do not represent an obstacle to the liberalisation of markets since they do not impose import restrictions or other forms of protectionism. They are thus in line with the general principles of the world economy.      Issues      The Commission identifies certain problems that should be addressed in order to ensure the continued success of fair trade initiatives. This involves ensuring greater consistency between the policies of the actors at various levels and establishing a legal definition of the concept as well as the criteria involved. Efforts should also be made to improve the substantiation, verification and control of fair trade products so as to allow consumers to make properly informed choices. In addition, consumers must be better informed about fair trade and dialogue should be continued with the movement, through the creation of a formal platform for example.

summary of   Directive 2006/7/EC concerning the management of bathing water quality   what is the aim of the directive  The Bathing Water Directive seeks to ensure that   the quality of bathing water is monitored;   improved management measures are introduced; and   information is made available to the public.   key points    The European Union (EU) is committed to protecting environmental quality and human health. This directive therefore strengthens the rules guaranteeing bathing water quality. It supplements  Directive 2000/60/EC  on water protection and management.   The directive does not apply to swimming pools or spa pools, or to artificially created confined waters, subject to treatment or used for therapeutic purposes.    Monitoring of bathing water    Each year, EU countries must identify the bathing waters in their territory and define the length of the bathing season.   They must establish monitoring at the location most used by bathers or where the risk of pollution is greatest. Monitoring must take place by means of sampling:   at least 4 samples, including 1 before the start of the bathing season;   3 samples only if the bathing season does not exceed 8 weeks or if the region is subject to special geographical constraints.     EU countries must communicate the results of their monitoring to the  European Commission  with a description of the water quality management measures. Monitoring may be suspended exceptionally once the Commission has been informed.    Determining bathing water quality    Water quality is assessed on the basis of microbiological data defined in accordance with the parameters set in Annex I of the directive. A classification of waters of poor, sufficient, good or excellent quality is established in compliance with the criteria set out in Annex II of the directive.   According to the directive, all bathing waters in the EU must have been at least of sufficient quality by the end of the 2015 bathing season. Furthermore, EU countries are to take the necessary measures to improve the number of bathing waters of good or excellent quality.   If quality is poor, EU countries must adopt the necessary measures to manage and eliminate pollution, and to protect and inform bathers.    Bathing water profile    The directive provides for profiles to be established for each bathing water. These can cover one individual site or more than one contiguous bathing waters. In particular, they comprise an assessment of:   the physical, geographical and hydrological characteristics of the bathing water and of other surface waters in the catchment area;   pollution and sources thereof;   management measures.     Bathing water profiles must be reviewed and updated as provided for in Annex III of the directive.    Exceptional measures    EU countries must adopt exceptional measures if unexpected situations deteriorate the quality of waters or represent a risk to bathers’ health.   Appropriate monitoring must also be implemented if there is a risk of  proliferation of algae  . The authorities responsible must therefore:   take management measures and provide information immediately if a proliferation of cyanobacteria (or ‘blue algae’) occurs;   assess the health risks if there is a proliferation of macro-algae and/or marine phytoplankton.      Transboundary waters    EU countries must exchange information and take joint action if a river basin extends over several territories.    Information to the public    National authorities must enable the public to obtain information and to participate in water quality management. Citizens may therefore make suggestions, remarks or complaints. They may also participate in the establishment, review and updating of lists of water quality.   Moreover, EU countries must ensure that adequate information is disseminated actively and is easily available during the bathing season. This concerns in particular:   the classification of water, prohibitions or advice against bathing;   a general description of the water in non-technical language;   a description of the nature and duration of pollution.     Directive  2013/64/EU  amends Directive 2006/7/EC following the amendment of the status of Mayotte in regard to the EU. France is the sole addressee.   Directive 2006/7/EC repealed and replaced Directive  76/160/EEC  on 31 December 2014.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 24 March 2006. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 24 March 2008.   background   For more information, see:    ‘Bathing water quality’  on the European Commission's website.
act   Directive  2014/66/EU  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals in the framework of an intra-corporate transfer.   summary   Multinational companies occasionally need to transfer staff from one country to another. The practice broadens an individual’s experience and can provide the host company with valuable expertise. As part of its common immigration policy, the European Union (EU) has standard rules to process the transfer applications and to ensure the people concerned are treated fairly when they arrive and work in the EU.   what does the directive do  The legislation sets out the terms and conditions that apply to non-EU citizens (known as third-country nationals) and their families when they are transferred by their company to work in one or more of its centres inside the EU for more than 90 days. It does not apply to the self-employed, students or people assigned by employment agencies.   key points    The directive provides a mechanism by which the transferee can carry out his/her assignment in multiple EU countries without interruption and without the need to re-apply for admission each time he/she moves country.   Family members may join the transferee and work on either a self-employed or employed basis.   Transferees must have worked for a certain time with their company before being transferred. They must have a work contract and provide evidence that they will be able to transfer back out of the EU once their EU assignment ends. Trainee employees must provide evidence of a university degree and may have to present a training agreement.   Payment to someone transferred should not be lower than that given to an EU national doing a comparable job.   The maximum duration for a transfer should not be more than 3 years for managers and specialists and 1 year for trainees.   National authorities may insist that the person being transferred has sufficient finances for themselves and their family so as not to have to rely on the local social assistance system.   Anyone considered a threat to public policy, public security or public health may be refused entry to the EU.   An application may also be refused, for instance, if the employer or the host company has failed to respect its various legal and fiscal obligations or is being wound up.   when does the directive apply  From 28 May 2014.

summary of   Directive 92/35/EEC — control rules and measures to combat African horse sickness   what is the aim of the directive  African horse sickness is a viral disease affecting all equidae  *  which is usually fatal in horses and could have serious socio-economic consequences. The directive sets out control rules and measures to combat the disease.   key points    If one or more horses on a holding is  suspected  of having African horse sickness, the relevant authorities should be notified immediately. The authorities should place the holding under official surveillance, and put in place the following measures:   an official census of the equidae, including those already dead, infected or liable to be infected;   a census of places conducive to carrier insects;   a full enquiry and a clinical examination of the equidae;   equidae are to be kept protected against carrier insects;   movement of equidae to or from the holding is prohibited;   efforts to eradicate carrier insects where equidae are housed;   equidae carcases are to be destroyed.     If the disease is  confirmed,  measures put in place will include:   all infected equidae, or those presenting symptoms, are to be killed immediately and the carcases destroyed;   the precautionary measures for holdings suspected of the disease are extended to holdings within at least 20 km of those where infection is confirmed;   equidae within this 20 km zone are to be vaccinated, except in specific circumstances.     A  protection zone  of at least 100 km around infected holdings must be set up, where all equidae are clinically examined and movement is banned except to a slaughterhouse within the protection zone or a zone under surveillance. A  surveillance zone  normally extends 50 km beyond the protection zone in areas where no systematic vaccination has been carried out in the previous 12 months.   People living in these zones must be informed of all the restrictions in force. Systematic  vaccination  of the animals may only be carried out in the protection zone.   EU countries must designate a  national laboratory  to coordinate the response to the disease, working in cooperation with other EU countries and the reference laboratory in Spain.   Each country must draw up its own  contingency plan  to respond to the disease, including setting up a crisis centre and local disease control centres.  European Commission  experts may make  spot checks  to ensure that these establishments are fully carrying out their responsibilities.   The  Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed  assists the Commission in managing African horse sickness.    Repeal   Directive  92/35/EEC  will be repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU)  2016/429  from 21 April 2021.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 18 May 1992. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 31 December 1992.   background   For more information, see:    ‘African horse sickness’  on the European Commission's website.   * key terms    equidae:  equine animals such as horses, donkeys and zebras, and cross-bred offspring.
summary of   Directive 2007/74/EC — exemption from value added tax and excise duty of goods imported by persons travelling from non-EU countries   what is the aim of the directive   It defines  EU  tax-free allowances in international travel.   It lays down rules relating to the exemption from value-added tax (VAT) and excise duty of goods imported into the personal luggage of travellers from:   a non-EU country or   a territory where EU laws on VAT and/or excise duty do not apply, e.g. the Isle of Man.     key points    The directive sets a  value threshold  for exemptions from excise duties at  €430  in the case of air and sea travellers and at  €300  for those travelling by land (including by inland waterways).   EU countries may lower the value threshold for travellers aged under 15, whatever their means of transport, but this threshold may not be lower than  €150  .   EU countries may lower the value thresholds and the quantitative limits for:   travellers who live in a border area;   cross-border workers; and   the crews of means of transport used in international travel.     The directive sets the following  higher or lower quantitative limits  for imports of  tobacco  :   200 cigarettes or 40 cigarettes; or   100 cigarillos or 20 cigarillos; or   50 cigars or 10 cigars; or   250 g smoking tobacco or 50 g smoking tobacco; or   a combination of the tobacco products listed above, provided that the total amount does not exceed 100% of the permitted limit.     EU countries may choose to distinguish between air travellers and other travellers by applying the lower quantitative limits to the other travellers.   The directive sets the following limit on  quantities  of imports of  alcohol  other than still wine and beer:   a total of 1 litre of an alcoholic strength exceeding 22% vol. or undenatured ethyl alcohol  *  of 80% vol. and over; or   a total of 2 litres of alcohol of a strength not exceeding 22% vol; or   a combination of the alcohol products listed above, provided that the amount does not exceed 100% of the permitted limit.     The directive sets the following limit for  quantities  of imports of  still wine and beer  :   a total of 4 litres of still wine; and   a total of 16 litres of beer.     Exemptions for tobacco and alcohol  do not apply to travellers under 17 years old  .   Standard tanks of any means of motor transport carrying fuel are exempt from paying excise duties on that fuel; they also do not have to pay excise duties on up to 10 litres of fuel held in a portable container.   Every 4 years the  European Commission  reports to the  Council  on the directive’s  implementation  . The most recent  report  , published in 2013, states that most EU countries are content with the directive and do not see any need to revise it.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 1 December 2008 and had to become law in the EU countries by the same date.   background   For more information, see:    Entering the EU  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Undenatured ethyl alcohol:  alcohol that has not had anything added to it to make it undrinkable.
summary   In April 2013, the EU guidelines for the development of European energy infrastructure were approved.  One of the priorities of the  Europe 2020 strategy  is sustainable growth to be achieved by promoting a more resource-efficient, more sustainable and more competitive economy. That strategy put  energy infrastructure at the forefront of this effort  by underlining the need to urgently upgrade Europe’s networks, interconnecting them at the continental level, in particular to integrate renewable energy sources.  The essential background to this is that EU Member States agreed in 2011 that:   Europe’s energy infrastructure needs to be  modernised and expanded  ;    networks across borders need to be interconnected  ;   there is a need to provide for  alternative supply or transit routes  ;   there is a need for alternative sources of energy, including  renewables  ;   no EU country should remain isolated from the European gas and electricity networks after 2015 or see its energy security jeopardised by lack of the appropriate connections.   The guidelines established  12 regional groups  for trans-European energy infrastructure (TEN-E), which selected projects.  In October 2013, the Commission adopted a list of  248 key energy infrastructure projects  (  projects of common interest  ), which will benefit from faster and more efficient permit granting procedures and improved regulatory treatment.  The projects may also have access to financial support from the  Connecting Europe Facility   (CEF)  , under which almost EUR 6 billion has been allocated to TEN-E up to 2020.  For a project to be included in the list, it has to:   have significant benefits for  at leasttwoEU Member States  ;   contribute to  market integration  and further  competition  ;   enhance  security of supply  ;   reduce  CO  2  emissions  .   A new EU list will be established every 2 years.  The guidelines state that projects of common interest should be implemented as quickly as possible and closely monitored and evaluated, while keeping the administrative burden for project promoters to a minimum.  It adds that the Commission should nominate  European coordinators  for projects facing particular difficulties.   act   Regulation (EU) No  347/2013  of the European Parliament and of the Council on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure and repealing Decision No 1364/2006/EC and amending Regulations (EC) No 713/2009, (EC) No 714/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009   REFERENCES           Act     Entry into force     Deadline for transposition in the Member States     Official Journal       Regulation (EU) No  347/2013      -     -     OJ L 115 of 25.4.2013
   Integrating sustainable development into Community cooperation policy     Integrating sustainable development into Community cooperation policy     The Commission defines a strategy to ensure that the environment plays a key role in the European Union's economic and development aid to partner countries, to enable those countries to assume their environmental responsibilities in the long term.     ACT     Commission Communication of 18 May 2000, entitled: "Integrating environment and sustainable development into economic and development cooperation policy - elements of a comprehensive strategy" [       COM(2000) 264      final - Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY      Environmental challenges arising from the Treaty of Amsterdam      Article 177 of the Treaty of Amsterdam lays down three development objectives which present challenges for the integration of the environment into European Union cooperation policy:      sustainable economic and social development: the communication stresses that the governments of developing countries need systematically to take account of environmental aspects when drawing up economic and social policies;       campaign against poverty: the Commission stresses that the objective should be to ensure systematic acknowledgement of linkages between poverty and environment in policy dialogues with developing countries;       fostering the integration of developing countries into the world economy: this objective can be achieved through trade, development of the private sector and international investment. As regards trade, the Commission wishes to clarify the relationships between certain WTO (World Trade Organisation) rules and the environment. As regards the private sector in developing countries, the Commission will ensure that private sector operators integrate environmental considerations into all their operations (e.g. environmental auditing and reporting, environmental management systems, adherence to internationally agreed codes of conduct, etc.). Finally, the communication recommends that regulations in developing countries on international investment should take account of environmental protection.       Environmental challenges arising from international agreements      As part of the political dialogue with developing countries, the Commission puts the emphasis on supporting those countries in their efforts to respond to global environmental issues and to implement the major UN environmental conventions on climate, biodiversity and desertification. It should also help these countries to respond to global environmental issues, while strengthening their capacity to negotiate emerging environment agreements.      Community funding and the environment      Community funding for environmental purposes remains modest compared with other EU aid. The communication stresses the key role played by the governments of developing countries in allocating the funds granted by the European Union. For this reason, the Commission must insist that they take account of environmental issues when allocating their resources.     In connection with economic and development cooperation, accounting of environmental expenditure needs to be improved to facilitate comparison between regions receiving Community aid and with the expenditure of the Member States.      Programming and project cycle      Programming is the first step to be taken in any cooperation between the Community and a developing country. It provides a good opportunity to ensure that the environment will be taken into account in development strategies, and to identify and avoid harmful environmental impacts of cooperation programmes.     Programming is currently being harmonised within the Community. At the end of this process, the same environmental integration procedures will be used for all regions receiving aid from the European Union.     A manual with guidelines for the integration of environmental aspects in policies and programming is currently being prepared by the Commission. This manual establishes a three-step approach:      a country environmental profile with performance indicators will serve as an input to the country strategy document;       systematic assessment of the environmental risks and opportunities of the proposed programme or policy;       improvement of the quality of the integration of environmental aspects through quality support groups.      The communication announces the inclusion of a short environment chapter in each country report, as a measure to improve programming.     European Union economic and development cooperation provides for compulsory mechanisms for the environmental assessment of programmes and projects, but these need to be further improved.      Advancing and evaluating the environment integration process      At present, all units dealing with environmental issues in the Commission have to observe the following mandate:      build capacity in the developing countries to assume greater responsibility in implementing environmentally sound cooperation programmes;       increase the capacity of staff to integrate environmental aspects in the cooperation programmes;       streamline internal procedures to incorporate environmental issues systematically;       establish a system (e.g. of a statistical nature) to continuously improve the quality of the output.      Training and capacity building are major activities for integrating the environment in cooperation policies. For this reason, a series of courses on the environment will be organised during 1999 and 2000 at the Commission and in some of its delegations. Environment training will also be given in all cooperation areas. In 2000, the Commission will carry out a comprehensive assessment of its training needs.     The overall environmental performance of EC aid to developing countries is evaluated regularly.     The Commission will carry out a study in order to improve its own internal procedures to integrate the environment more effectively.     The communication mentions certification and accreditation of the environmental integration process in accordance with an internationally acknowledged and standardised environmental management system as the most credible approach to achieving sound management.     In Annex I to the communication, we find legal texts on the integration of the environment and sustainable development into EU economic and development cooperation policies.     Annex II concerns the integration of the environment into selected EC economic and development and cooperation policy documents since 1992.     Annex III gives details of Community participation in multilateral environment agreements. It mentions the multilateral environment agreements to which the Community is, or will be, a contracting party.     Annex IV shows the regional breakdown of funding to different environment themes and the EU, EIB (European Investment Bank) and EBRD (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) funding instruments for third countries.     Annexes V and VI refer to the indicators used by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) and the European Union in environment matters.

summary of   Regulation (EU) No 1287/2013 — establishing a programme for the competitiveness of enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises (COSME) (2014–20)   what is the aim of the regulation  It establishes a European Union (EU) programme that seeks to boost support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by improving conditions under which entrepreneurship can thrive.   key points    SMEs are the  main contributors to economic growth and employment  in the EU. Under the competitiveness of enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises (  COSME  ) programme, it is now easier for SMEs to stay competitive through access to finance and markets, the simplification of regulation and the promotion of entrepreneurship.   COSME will provide a  direct channel for communication  between European SMEs and the  European Commission  .    Better business conditions    COSME will support actions that  improve access to finance  for SMEs from start-up to growth phases. Financial instruments include equality and loan guarantee facilities. In some cases, these can be used along with national financial instruments for regional policy and the  Horizon 2020 programme  for research and innovation.   The programme will also grant  better access to markets inside and outside the EU  . The programme will provide information on areas such as:   available business opportunities,   barriers to market entry in areas outside the EU,   advice on legal and customs practices.     Support services on  intellectual property rights  , including assisting cross-border business cooperation, technology and R & D transfer and innovation partnerships, will also be provided.    Promoting competition    In order to maintain the competitiveness and sustainability of businesses, the programme aims to  improve the design and implementation  of existing policies that affect SMEs. It will also promote  cross-border collaboration  and support the  development of products and services and technologies  .   SMEs will also be encouraged to operate in an  environmentally sustainable way  and demonstrate  social corporate responsibility  .    A culture of entrepreneurship    The programme will also focus on promoting entrepreneurship. It aims to create an entrepreneurial culture in the EU  by removing barriers  that make it hard for small businesses to grow, including changing regulatory burdens already placed on SMEs.   The programme will pay particular attention to  young female entrepreneurs,  as well as other specific target groups, such as  older people and entrepreneurs belonging to socially disadvantaged communities  .    Funding   The programme has a budget of €2.3 billion over 7 years, and runs from 2014 to 2020. It will be managed by the  Executive Agency for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises  .   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 23 December 2013.   background   For more information, see:    COSME programme  (  European Commission  ).
summary of   Directive 93/103/EC — minimum safety and health requirements for work on board fishing vessels   what is the aim of the directive  It outlines measures and responsibilities intended to improve health and safety on board fishing vessels.   key points   Owners of fishing vessels must ensure that their use does not endanger the safety and health of workers, considering foreseeable weather conditions. Under the terms of  Directive 89/391/EEC  , they must also consider any hazards faced by remaining workers when their co-workers leave their workstations to respond to dangerous situations.  New fishing vessels and major repairs and alterations to existing vessels had to comply with minimum safety and health requirements by 23 November 1995, while existing vessels had a further 7 years to comply.  Any occurrences at sea affecting the safety and health of the workers on board must be reported to the relevant authorities and in the ship’s log.  EU countries must ensure that vessels are checked regularly by specifically empowered authorities to ensure compliance with the directive.   Owner obligations   Owners must ensure that vessels and their fittings and equipment are clean and well-maintained and must follow the detailed requirements listed in the annexes to the directive in the following areas:   seaworthiness and stability;   mechanical and electrical installations;   radio installation;   emergency routes and exits;   fire detection and fire fighting;   ventilation of enclosed workplaces;   temperature of working areas;   natural and artificial lighting of workplaces;   decks, bulkheads and deckheads;   doors;   traffic routes — danger areas;   layout of workstations;   living quarters;   sanitary facilities;   first aid;   accommodation ladders and gangways;   noise.   Adequate and suitable emergency and survival equipment should be kept on board.   Training and consultation   Workers should be kept informed of all health and safety measures and should be appropriately trained, in particular in accident prevention and the use of life-saving and survival equipment. Anybody likely to be in command should be additionally trained in the prevention of occupational illness and accidents, the stability and maintenance of the vessel under all foreseeable operational conditions, and radio navigation and communication.  Workers, or their representatives, should be consulted on safety and health measures in accordance with Directive 89/391/EEC. Representatives should be given the means to carry out these activities, including time off without loss of pay, and must not be penalised because of them. They must also have the opportunity to submit their observations during inspection visits under the worker participation terms outlined in Directive 89/391/EEC.   Implementation   EU countries must report to the  European Commission  every 5 years on the practical implementation of the directive, including the points of view of employers and workers.  A 2009  report  from the Commission assesses practical implementation of this directive, as well as the 1992  directive on the minimum safety and health requirements for improved medical treatment on board vessels  .   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 2 January 1994. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 23 November 1995.   background   For more information, see:    ‘Directive 93/103/EC — work on board fishing vessels’  on the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work’s website

   Notification of national measures derogating from the principle of the free movement of goods     Notification of national measures derogating from the principle of the free movement of goods     The transparency of national measures which act as a barrier to the free movement of products makes it easier to deal with problems which undermine the principle of the free movement of goods. This decision introduces a procedure whereby Member States are required to notify the Commission of any national measures which derogate from this principle. This type of procedure helps solve problems arising in connection with the operation of the internal market to the satisfaction of both business and consumers.     ACT     Decision       3052/95/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 1995 establishing a procedure for the exchange of information on national measures derogating from the principle of the free movement of goods within the Community.     SUMMARY     Decision 3052/95/EC introduces a system for the exchange of information between the Member States and the Commission. This notification system relates to national measures derogating from the principle of the free movement of goods in non-harmonised sectors.      Scope      The information system entails the notification of national measures which act as a barrier to the free movement or placing on the market of a particular model or type of goods lawfully produced or marketed in another Member State, where the direct or indirect effect of the measure is a general ban on the goods, a refusal to allow the goods to be placed on the market, the modification of the model or type of product concerned before it can be placed or kept on the market, or withdrawal of the goods from the market.      Exemptions and derogations      The information system does not apply to:      measures taken solely in pursuance of Community harmonisation measures;       measures notified to the Commission under specific provisions;       draft measures notified to the Commission under specific Community provisions;       measures, such as preventive measures or investigations, which simply prepare or lead up to the main measure acting as a barrier to the free movement or placing on the market of a particular model or type of goods lawfully produced or marketed in another Member State;       measures relating solely to the protection of public morality or public order;       measures relating to second-hand goods which, with time or use, have become unsuitable for being placed or kept on the market.       Context      Decision No 3052/95/EC is repealed and replaced by Regulation No       764/2008      laying down procedures relating to the application of certain national technical rules to products lawfully marketed in another Member State, from 13 May 2009.

summary of   Directive 92/106/EEC — common rules for certain types of combined transport of goods between EU countries   what is the aim of the directive   It aims to promote intermodal  *  transport operations by supporting the international operations meeting certain criteria (i.e. so called combined transport or CT) by:   safeguarding CT from national restrictions (authorisation schemes, tariffs and quotas);   clarifying that road cabotage  *  restrictions do not apply to the CT road legs;   allowing heavier and bigger loads for vehicles used in CT road legs;   granting financial support through tax incentives and extended definition of own-account transport for CT operations.     key points    Scope   The directive refers to the CT of goods between EU countries where:   the vehicle or trailer uses the  road  on the initial or final leg of the journey; and   on the other leg,  rail or inland waterway or maritime services  where this section  exceeds 100 km  as the crow flies; and   makes the initial or final road transport leg of the journey:   between the point where the goods are loaded and the nearest suitable rail loading station for the initial leg and between the nearest suitable rail unloading stations and the point where the goods are unloaded for the final leg, or   within a radius  not exceeding 150 km  as the crow flies from the inland waterway port or seaport of loading or unloading.     Authorised dimensions and maximum weights for trucks carrying out cross-border travel are set out in Directive  96/53/EC  (see  summary  ).   Transport document   The transport document to be provided in the case of CT must specify:   the rail loading and unloading stations relating to the rail leg; and   the inland waterway loading and unloading ports relating to the inland waterway leg or the maritime loading and unloading ports relating to the maritime section of the journey.    Cross-border transport    All hauliers established in an EU country who meet the conditions of access to the occupation and access to the market for transport of goods between EU countries may, in the context of a CT operation, carry out initial and/or final road haulage legs which form an integral part of the operation and which may or may not include the crossing of a frontier.   The directive sets out specific rules for CT operations where the dispatching/receiving party carries out the initial/final road haulage leg on its own account. The receiving/dispatching party may then also carry out the transport operation on its own account under certain conditions.   Regulation (EC) No  1072/2009  sets out common EU rules for access to the EU haulage market aimed at non-resident hauliers carrying out road cabotage (see  summary  ).   EU countries’ obligations   EU countries must take measures to ensure that the motor vehicle taxes applicable to road vehicles routed in combined transport are reduced or reimbursed.   Review   The  European Commission  must draw up a report to the  Council  every 2 years on the development of CT.   from when does the directive apply  It has applied since 15 December 1992 and had to become law in the EU countries by 30 June 1993.   background   For further information see:    Multimodal and combined transport  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Intermodal:  the transport of goods using rail, inland waterway or maritime services in addition to road transport.   Cabotage:  where a haulier registered in one EU country carries out national transport in another EU country.

   Traffic management: air traffic controller licences     Traffic management: air traffic controller licences     European airspace remains one of the world's most congested traffic areas. Fragmentation of the air management system into national "islands" of rules, procedures, markets and performance levels is now the main impediment to making progress in this industry. It is therefore important that the entrance conditions and conditions of practice relating to the profession of air traffic controller be harmonised. The single European sky package is designed to remedy this fragmentation through a number of initiatives, one of which is the Community air traffic controller licence, by which Community rules can be introduced which will ensure higher levels of safety.     ACT     Directive       2006/23/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on a Community air traffic controller licence.     SUMMARY     This Directive applies to applicants for a student air traffic controller licence and to air traffic controllers employed by air navigation service providers operating mainly in the field of general air traffic.     Member States must designate a body or bodies as their national supervisory authority to take on the tasks assigned to such authorities under the new rules. Member States must ensure that national supervisory authorities exercise their powers impartially and transparently.     The Directive will:      lay down rules on all the elements of the licensing chain;       make the institutional framework laid down in the Single European Sky legislation applicable to training; training is seen as a service similar to air navigation services, including the possibility of inspections and surveys;       specify the conditions for obtaining and maintaining a licence;       harmonise competencies by imposing a structure of ratings and endorsements which specify the type of service that the air traffic controller is competent to deliver;       give further guarantees of a high level of competence, particularly through the auditing requirement and the system for approving examiners.      The provision of air navigation services requires highly skilled personnel. For air traffic control the appropriate means is the Community licence, to be seen as a kind of diploma. In this context, air traffic controller licences will be issued to applicants who:      hold at least a secondary education diploma (or equivalent degree) or a diploma granting access to university;       have successfully completed an approved initial training course relevant to the rating, including practical training and simulation;       hold a valid medical certificate; medical certificates must be issued in accordance with the international medical requirements;       have demonstrated an adequate level of linguistic ability; Member States must ensure that air traffic controllers can demonstrate the ability to operate in English and possibly the local language.      At the same time, applicants must:      be at least 18 years old;       hold a student licence;       hold a valid medical certificate;       have demonstrated an adequate level of linguistic ability in accordance with the set requirements.      Each Member State must recognise the licence and its associated ratings and endorsements issued by the national supervisory authority of another Member State. This should lead to the recognition of licences throughout the Community, thereby increasing both freedom of movement and the availability of air traffic controllers.     This directive is repealed by Regulation (EC) No       1108/2009      from December 2012.      Background      The objective of this Directive is to raise       safety standards      and improve the operation of the Community air traffic control system through the issuance of a Community air traffic controller licence.     Air traffic controllers are a key link in the safety chain. The licence is thus part of a wider Community safety policy enshrined in the package. It should provide the opportunity to revise or reinforce safety aspects of air traffic management and introduce high standards for the training system.     The       International Civil Aviation Organisation      (ICAO) has adopted provisions on air traffic controller licensing, including linguistic requirements. In addition, the European Organisation for the       Safety of Air Navigation      (Eurocontrol) has adopted Eurocontrol Safety Regulatory Requirements relating to training and licensing. However, despite these many international regulations, licensing remains highly fragmented in the European Union Member States.

   Development of micro-credit     Development of micro-credit     Micro-credit can encourage economic growth and employment in Europe in line with the Lisbon agenda. It allows micro-enterprises and those wishing to set up their own business to obtain financial support when they do not have access to traditional banking services. The European Union is presenting an initiative, comprising four strands, which seeks to encourage the development of micro-credit in Europe.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 13 November 2007 – A European initiative for the development of micro-credit in support of growth and employment [       COM(2007) 708      final – Not published in the Official Journal].     SUMMARY     In Europe, micro-credit – i.e. loans of less than € 25 000 – is aimed at micro-enterprises (enterprises employing fewer than 10 people) and disadvantaged persons (unemployed or inactive people, those receiving social assistance, immigrants, etc.) who wish to go into self-employment but do not have access to traditional banking services.     Micro-credit can promote the transition from unemployment to self-employment and offers access to finance for persons whose projects the banks refuse to finance because of insufficient collateral. It can thus play a key role in implementing the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs.     Nevertheless, even if micro-credit has been on the increase for a number of years in the Member States of the European Union (EU), much remains to be done to enable this instrument to develop its full potential.     Therefore, the EU is proposing an initiative aimed at developing the market for micro-credit. The initiative comprises four strands:      improving the legal and institutional environment in the Member States;       further changing the climate in favour of entrepreneurship;       promoting the spread of best practices, particularly in relation to training;       providing additional financial capital for micro-credit institutions.       First strand: improving the legal and institutional environment in the Member States      The institutional framework in the Member States does not always allow micro-credit to develop in a positive way. Indeed, the specific nature of micro-credit is not generally taken into account in national or Community legislation. The Commission therefore encourages the Member States to take the measures needed to create a legal, institutional and business environment which is more conducive to the development of micro-credit. With this in mind, the Commission proposes that the Member States:       create an environment allowing the development of micro-finance institutions (MFIs) and covering all segments of the clientele        . Given the number and diversity of potential clients, MFIs should have easy access to financial resources allowing them to develop micro-credit. MFIs are financed through grants and donations and, where appropriate, bank loans. They are certain to benefit from the creation of a suitable environment in which they are more visible;        help micro-credit to become sustainable by relaxing interest caps for micro-credit operations.        In the Member States where they exist, interest rates should be fixed at a fairly high level in order that lending institutions can cover their costs, while regularly evaluating the social and economic impact in order not to jeopardise the security of borrowers;        reduce operating costs by applying favourable tax schemes.        More favourable tax schemes (tax exemptions, tax reductions, grants) are important for the development of micro-credit;        adapt national regulation and supervision to the specificity of micro-finance        . If they receive deposits, MFIs are subject to Community prudential regulation and are supervised accordingly. In order not to put a brake on the supply of micro-credit and the growth of MFIs not receiving deposits from clients, the new regulations and supervision must take account of their costs and the risks which MFIs pose.       Second strand: further changing the climate in favour of entrepreneurship      In order to encourage Europe's shift towards an economy based on knowledge, services and new technologies, and to create a climate more conducive to entrepreneurship, the Commission proposes that the Member States:       improve the institutional framework for self-employment and micro-enterprises.        Equal treatment for the self-employed and wage-earners is essential. Nevertheless, a programme of publicity and awareness-raising should be set up in order that self-employment and micro-enterprises are better recognised. To this end, legal, tax and administrative barriers should be lowered (e.g. exemption from social insurance charges, simplified registration procedures, improved access to more numerous and less expensive outlets);        increase the chances of success of new micro-enterprises through training, mentoring and business development services.        The micro-enterprise environment is a complex one and demands a supply of business development services because those starting up in business do not always have all the competencies required in order to be successful. Training and mentoring are therefore needed to improve a start-up entrepreneur's chances of success.       Third strand: promoting the spread of best practices      Promoting the spread of best practices for MFIs is a key element in the initiative to encourage micro-credit. The Commission therefore proposes to set up a new body to provide technical assistance and support the development of non-bank MFIs in the Member States. This new body would have the task of:      laying down a         code of conduct for MFIs.        Such a code would serve to increase confidence in MFIs and spread ethical and customer-friendly best practices among them. The quality of an MFI would thus be assessed on the basis of its social and financial performances and its business practices;       introducing         a specific "micro-credit" label to create awareness among EU citizens.        This label would enable the attention of investment funds dedicated to micro-credit to be focused more on MFIs which perform well, and improve citizens' confidence in microfinance investment vehicles and steer new resources towards MFIs with the best social and financial performance;       providing information on this initiative and handling the publicity;       publishing brochures and organising conferences;       providing technical manuals, guides and software designed to help MFIs adopt best practices;       providing easier access to finance for MFIs by mobilising financial resources.       Fourth strand: providing additional financial capital for new non-bank MFIs      The Commission proposes to set up a support structure within the JEREMIE department of the EIF for the purpose of providing technical and financial support to promising non-bank MFIs. This micro-fund would have the aim of assisting MFIs to become self-sustaining and would help to increase the use of micro-credit in Europe and further develop this sector.      Context      This initiative seeks to promote the sustainable development of micro-credit in the EU and forms part of the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs, and of the policy of encouraging entrepreneurship and economic initiative, the policy of promoting "flexicurity" and the inclusion of disadvantaged persons, and the policy of developing human capital and renewing trust-based social links.

act   Directive 2010/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 July 2010 on the framework for the deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in the field of road transport and for interfaces with other modes of transport.   summary   The aim of eCall is to bring rapid assistance to occupants of a vehicle involved in a serious accident anywhere in the European Union plus Iceland, Norway and Switzerland.  eCall is activated automatically as soon as in-vehicle sensors detect a serious crash. Once set off, the system dials the European emergency number 112, establishes a telephone link to the appropriate emergency call centre and sends details of the accident to the rescue services, including the time of incident, the accurate position of the crashed vehicle and the direction of travel (especially important on motorways and in tunnels). An eCall can also be triggered manually by pushing a button in the car, for example by a witness to a serious accident. Shortly after the accident, emergency services therefore know that there has been an accident and the precise location of the accident.  The data received through the eCall system will allow emergency services to provide assistance to vehicle drivers and passengers more quickly, thus helping to save lives and to treat injuries rapidly. Estimates suggest that eCall could speed up emergency response times by 40% in urban areas and 50% in the countryside, and save up to 2,500 lives a year.  In addition to the road safety benefits, eCall will also have a significant impact on reducing the congestion caused by traffic accidents and on reducing secondary accidents caused by unsecured accident sites It is also expected that the in-vehicle equipment introduced by eCall could be used for other additional emergency and/or added value services, in parallel with or building on the 112-based eCall in-vehicle system.  Directive 2010/40/EU of 7 July 2010 on the framework for the deployment of ITS in the field of road transport and for interfaces with other modes of transport has identified as one of the six priority actions for which binding specifications will have to be elaborated (Art. 6) the harmonised provision for an interoperable EU-wide eCall (art 3 d).

summary of    Regulation (EEC) No 4055/86 applying the principle of freedom to provide services to maritime transport between EU countries and with non-EU countries     Regulation (EEC) No 4057/86 on unfair pricing practices in maritime transport     Regulation (EEC) No 4058/86 on coordinated action to safeguard free access to cargoes in ocean trades     Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 on the implementation of the rules on competition laid down in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty     Regulation (EC) No 246/2009 on the application of Article 81(3) of the Treaty to certain categories of agreements, decisions and concerted practices between liner shipping companies (consortia)     Regulation (EC) No 906/2009 on the application of Article 81(3) of the Treaty to certain categories of agreements, decisions and concerted practices between liner shipping companies (consortia)    what is the aim of the regulations  They aim to organise maritime transport in accordance with the basic principles of EU law to  provide services  ,  competition  , and  free access to the market  in sea transport.   key points    Freedom to provide services    Regulation No 4055/86:    grants EU-country nationals (and non-EU shipping companies using ships registered in an EU country and controlled by EU nationals) the  right to carry passengers or goods by sea  between any port of an EU country and any port or offshore installation of another EU country or of a non-EU country;   requires any  national restrictions  which reserve the carriage of goods to vessels flying the national flag  to be phased out or adjusted  , and prevents the introduction of new restrictions;   sets out a  procedure  for cases where EU-country shipping companies have no effective opportunity to carry goods to and from a particular non-EU country;    extends the benefits  of the regulation to  non-EU nationals established in the EU  .   Regulation No  3577/92/EEC  deals specifically with freedom to provide services in sea transport within EU countries (‘maritime cabotage’  *  ).   Unfair pricing in maritime transport    Regulation No 4057/86:    authorises the EU to apply  redressive duties  in order to protect shipowners in EU countries from unfair pricing practices on the part of non-EU shipowners. These redressive duties can be imposed after an investigation which demonstrates that injury has been caused by unfair pricing and that the interests of the EU make intervention necessary;   concerning the  examination of injury  , lays down the appropriate factors or indicators to be taken into consideration, e.g. a reduction in the shipowner’s market share or profits, or the effect on employment;   lays down a  procedure  for complaints, consultations and subsequent investigations.    Free access to ocean trades    Regulation No 4058/86:    applies when action by a non-EU country or by its agents  restricts free access  to the transport of liner cargoes, bulk cargoes or other cargoes by shipping companies of EU countries or by ships registered in an EU country (except where such action is taken in conformity with the  United Nations liner code  );   allows for  coordinated action by the EU  following a request made by an EU country to the  European Commission  . Such action might include diplomatic representation to non-EU countries and countermeasures directed at the shipping companies concerned;   permits similar coordinated action to be taken at the request of another country belonging to the  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  with which a  reciprocal arrangement  has been concluded.    Competition rules   General EU competition laws laid down in  Regulation (EC) No 1/2003  also apply to the EU maritime transport sector. However, in accordance with  Council Regulation (EC) No 246/2009  , the Commission may make exceptions for certain types of cooperation between liner shipping  *  companies (consortia  *  ). The Commission accordingly adopted  Regulation (EC) No 906/2009  , which allows these exceptions, and extended it until 25 April 2020 by Regulation (EU) No  697/2014  .   from when do the regulations apply   Council Regulation (EEC) No 4055/86 has applied since 1 January 1987.   Council Regulations (EEC) No 4057/86 and 4058/86 have applied since 1 July 1987.   Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 has applied since 1 May 2004.

   Strategy for the Customs Union     Strategy for the Customs Union     The Commission defines a new strategy to be adopted for customs activities in the European Union in order to adapt to the present and future changes and to propose concrete actions to be taken.     ACT     Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee of 8 February 2001 concerning a strategy for the Customs Union [       COM (2001) 51      final – Not published in the Official Journal]     SUMMARY     This Communication reviews the challenges confronting customs activities at present and in the short term: enlargement of the European Union, the fight against fraud, organised crime, the role of Customs in revenue collection, developments in international trade, the safety of citizens, new trading techniques, influence on the competitiveness of EU businesses and the increasing importance of indirect taxes.     The Communication refers to best practices, cooperation between the structures involved, training of officials and operators, simplification of legislation and investments in infrastructure and equipment as instruments to meet the above-mentioned challenges.     The European Union's strategic objectives in the field of customs for the coming years are:      to provide a framework based on transparent, stable and appropriate rules for the development of international trade;       to provide the Community and Member States with the necessary resources;       to protect society from unfair trading and to safeguard its financial, commercial, health and environmental interests.      The Commission has indicated five areas of action for introducing the new strategy for the Customs Union: simplifying and rationalising legislation, improving customs controls, providing a good service to the business community, improving training and improving international cooperation in the customs field.      Simplifying and rationalising legislation      Amendments to the customs legislation are necessary to confront issues of fraud and to take account of changes in the business world. The Communication proposes the following practical actions:      to involve economic operators in the preparation of legislation and to assist them with complex legislation;       to continue the harmonisation of sanctions;       to ensure that all regulations allow data to be transmitted electronically;       to improve the implementation of legislation.       Improving customs controls      Several actions are proposed in this field:      to improve the standards and application of controls;       to improve cooperation between the customs administrations and between them and the tax authorities, police authorities, etc.       to use risk analysis more effectively;       to reinforce the         fight against counterfeiting        , piracy and false origin marking;       to introduce a new computerised transit system (NCTS);       to apply the new information technologies to the customs;       to develop joint audit modules between the Commission and the Member States.       Providing a good service to the business community      The Communication lists the following actions to improve the service to the business community:      to simplify and improve procedures;       to facilitate electronic access to customs information;       to continue the work on facilitating trade;       to use memoranda of understanding to strengthen cooperation.       Improving training      Training is obviously necessary for customs officials and economic operators. The Commission is proposing:      to set up common training modules;       to complete the feasibility study on the European Customs Academy;       to direct training towards problem areas and business compliance with the legislation.       Improving international cooperation      In order to improve cooperation between the customs administrations, the Communication emphasises the need:      to represent the Community appropriately in the international forums dealing with customs issues;       to promote international cooperation in view of the challenges of enlargement and combating fraud, among other things.      RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee of 1 April 2008 entitled: "Strategy for the evolution of the Customs Union" [         COM(2008) 169        final – Not published in the Official Journal]      The present strategy aims to complete the customs reform. After the modernisation of the customs legal and technological environment, this process is to be applied in the customs administrations, bringing out the human dimension.

   Obligation of air carriers to communicate passenger data     Obligation of air carriers to communicate passenger data     This Directive requires air carriers to collect and transmit passenger data to the authorities of the Member State of destination responsible for control. Non-compliance may lead to fines being imposed and even, in the case of serious infringement, confiscation of the means of transport or withdrawal of the operating licence.     ACT     Council Directive       2004/82/EC      of 29 April 2004 on the obligation of carriers to communicate passenger data.     SUMMARY     According to this Directive, air carriers       *      are required to communicate information concerning their passengers travelling to a European Union (EU) border crossing       *      . This information is supplied, at the request of the authorities responsible for carrying out checks       *      on persons at the external borders       *      of the EU, to improve border control and to combat illegal immigration more effectively.     These data are forwarded to these authorities for passenger registration purposes. In principle they are transmitted electronically to these authorities.     Carriers are required to transmit the following information: number and type of travel document used, nationality, name and date of birth of the passenger, border crossing point of entry into the EU, departure and arrival time of the transportation, total number of passengers carried.     In principle, these data are deleted by these authorities within 24 hours of transmission, provided that the passengers have arrived within the territory of the Member States. The personal data are deleted by the carrier within 24 hours of arrival of the means of transport.     Member States must adopt dissuasive, effective and proportionate sanctions, should carriers fail to comply with this obligation. Such sanctions are applicable to carriers which, as a result of fault, have not transmitted data or have transmitted incomplete or false data. The maximum amount of these sanctions is not less than EUR 5000 and their minimum amount is not less than EUR 3000 for each journey.     Member States may also provide for other types of sanctions in the event of serious infringement of the communication requirement. These sanctions may consist of:      immobilisation, seizure and confiscation of the means of transport;       temporary suspension or even withdrawal of the carrier's operating licence.      Carriers may appeal against measures imposed against them. Member States adopt all the necessary measures for this right of appeal to be effective.      Background      This Directive was adopted following a request by the European Council of 25 and 26 March 2004, which met following the terrorist attacks in Madrid. The obligations provided for in this Directive are complementary to those laid down by Article 26 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, as supplemented by Council Directive       2001/51/EC      , concerning the       obligation of carriers to return third-country nationals      who are refused entry by the Member State of destination.       Key terms used in the act         Carrier: any natural or legal person whose occupation it is to provide passenger transport by air.         External borders: external borders of the Member States with third countries.         Border control: check carried out at a border exclusively on account of crossing that border.         Border crossing point: any crossing point authorised by the competent authorities for crossing external borders.

summary of   Regulation (EU) 2019/1781 laying down ecodesign requirements for electric motors and variable speed drives   what is the aim of the regulation  The regulation establishes   ecodesign    *  requirements for the placing on the market or putting into service of  electric motors   *  and  variable speed drives  (VSD)  *  , including where they are integrated in other products.   key points   The regulation applies to:   induction  electric motors  without brushes, commutators, slip rings or electrical connections to the rotor, rated for operation on a 50 Hz, 60 Hz or 50/60 Hz sinusoidal voltage, that   have 2, 4, 6 or 8 poles   have a rated voltage above 50 V and up to and including 1,000 V   have a rated power output from 0.12 kW up to and including 1,000 kW   are rated on the basis of continuous duty operation and   are rated for direct online operation;      variable speed drives  with 3-phase input that   are rated for operating with a motor referred to above, within the 0.12 kW-1,000 kW motor rated output range   have a rated voltage above 100 V and up to and including 1,000 V AC and   have only 1 AC voltage output.     Some types of equipment designed to operate in certain conditions are  exempt  from some of the energy efficiency and product information requirements, such as:   motors or VSDs completely integrated into a product (for example into a gear, pump, fan or compressor) and whose energy performance cannot be tested independently;   motors specifically designed to operate exclusively at high altitudes or in extreme temperatures;   motors specifically designed and specified to operate wholly immersed in a liquid;   motors or VSDs specifically qualified for the safety of nuclear installations;   explosion-protected motors specifically designed and certified for mining;   motors in cordless or battery-operated equipment;   motors in hand-held equipment whose weight is supported by hand during operation;   motors in hand-guided mobile equipment moved while in operation;   motors placed on the market before 1 July 2029 as substitutes for identical motors integrated in products placed on the market before 1 July 2022, and specifically marketed as such;   motors designed specifically for the traction of electric vehicles.   The regulation:   sets out a timetable in Annex I for the introduction of ecodesign requirements (initially 1 July 2021, with further requirements being introduced from 1 July 2022 and from 1 July 2023). These cover   energy efficiency of electrical motors   product information requirements for electrical motors   efficiency and product information requirements for variable speed drives;     sets out the conformity assessment procedure, and in Annex II the measurement methods and calculations that must be followed.    National authorities  must apply the verification procedures laid down in Annex III when carrying out market surveillance checks.  Annex IV sets out indicative  benchmarks  based on the best available technology for motors and variable speed drives for the environmental aspects considered significant and quantifiable. For motors, the IE4 level was identified as the best available technology.  The Commission must  review  the regulation in the light of technological progress and present the results of this assessment including, if appropriate, a draft revision proposal, to the Consultation Forum no later than 14 November 2023.  The regulation amends Regulation (EC) No  641/2009  and repeals Regulation (EC) No  640/2009  .   from when does the regulation apply  It applies from 1 July 2021.   background   Directive  2009/125/EC  establishes a framework to set  ecodesign requirements for energy-related products  . The Commission must set these for products which are widely sold and traded in the EU and have a significant environmental impact.  The  WEEE Directive  sets requirements on recovery and recycling of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) to reduce the negative environmental effects of generating and managing WEEE, and of the use of resources.  For more information, see:    Electric motors  (  European Commission  )    About the energy label and ecodesign  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Ecodesign:  Policy to improve, through better design, products’ environmental performance throughout their life cycle, especially their energy efficiency.   Electric motor:  a device that converts electrical input power into mechanical output power in the form of a rotation with a rotational speed and torque that depends on factors including the frequency of the supply voltage and number of poles of the motor.   Variable speed drive (VSD):  an electronic power converter that continuously adapts the electrical power supplied to a single motor to control the motor’s mechanical power output according to the torque-speed characteristic of the load driven by the motor, by adjusting the power supply to a variable frequency and voltage supplied to the motor. It includes all electronics connected between the mains and the motor including extensions such as protection devices, transformers and auxiliaries.
summary of   Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 relating to fertilisers   what is the aim of the regulation   It brings into one piece of legislation all the European Union rules that apply to fertilisers — chemical compounds that provide nutrients to plants.   It ensures that these highly technical requirements are implemented uniformly throughout the EU.   key points    The regulation only applies to mineral fertilisers consisting of one or more plant nutrients. Other fertilisers are governed by EU countries’ national legislation.   In its Annex I, the regulation lists fertiliser types according to their specific characteristics. Once a fertiliser meets this type designation it may bear the letters ‘EC’. The fertiliser may then be sold and used throughout the EU. This EC designation guarantees farmers that the fertilisers contain a minimum nutrient content and are safe to use.   For a new type designation to be listed in the Annex I to the regulation, the manufacturer of a fertiliser corresponding to that type designation must lodge a request with a national competent authority. This request is forwarded to the  European Commission  , which consults the other EU countries and decides to accept or reject the application based on the advice of a committee set up by the regulation.   To achieve the EC status, a fertiliser must provide nutrients effectively, not harm human, animal or plant health or the environment and demonstrate it has been subject to the relevant sampling, analysis and test methods.   Manufacturers must keep records that make it possible to  trace  a fertiliser while it is on the market and for a further 2 years thereafter.   Certain basic information, such as the manufacturer’s contact details and the fertiliser’s main properties, must appear on packages, labelling and accompanying documents.   Specific rules apply to primary  *  and secondary  *  inorganic nutrient fertilisers, to inorganic  *  micro-nutrient  *  fertilisers and to ammonium nitrate fertilisers of high nitrogen content.   Certain product types have been added for liming materials (materials that neutralise acid soils) and agronomic fertiliser additives, as well as inhibitors (such as nitrogen inhibitors — materials that slow down or prevent nitrification  *  ).   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 11 December 2003 with the exception of Articles 8 and 26(3) which relate to traceability aspects and which have applied since 11 June 2005.   background   In March 2016, the Commission adopted a  proposal  which aims to simplify the existing legislation, to improve the way the EU’s fertiliser market works and to extend the rules to non-harmonised products, i.e. those fertilisers governed by EU countries’ national laws. To prepare for this initiative, the Commission has conducted various studies into areas such as fertiliser ingredients and the science of plant bio-stimulants.  For more information, see:    Specific chemicals  on the European Commission’s website.   * key terms     Primary nutrient:  one containing the elements nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium only.     Secondary nutrient:  one containing the elements calcium, magnesium, sodium and sulphur.     Inorganic fertiliser:  a fertiliser in which the declared nutrients are in the form of minerals obtained by extraction or by physical and/or chemical industrial processes.     Micro-nutrients:  containing the elements boron, cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum and zinc, essential for plant growth in quantities that are small compared with those of primary and secondary nutrients.     Nitrification:  a natural process in the environment in which specialised bacteria convert ammonia in the soil into nitrites and nitrates.
summary of   Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 laying down health rules as regards animal by-products and derived products not intended for human consumption   what is the aim of the regulation   It seeks to lay down  public health  and animal health rules for  animal by-products   *  and  derived products   *  .   These rules are designed to prevent and minimise risks to human and animal health, and to ensure the food and feed chain is kept safe.   key points    The legislation applies to:   animal by-products and derived products which, by law, may not be used for human consumption;   animal-origin products which may be used for human consumption but are instead used for other purposes;   raw materials to manufacture animal origin products not intended for human consumption.     Producers of animal by-products and derived products must ensure they comply with the legislation from the start to the end of the manufacturing chain.   They must keep a record of the products they dispatch, transport or receive, along with the required documentation.   They must inform national authorities of the products and premises they use during the manufacturing chain. The latter must meet certain hygiene standards and require formal approval.   EU countries operate official checks to ensure producers collect, identify and transport animal by-products without delay and treat, use or dispose of them according to the rules.   Derived products, such as  cosmetics  ,  medical devices  and  veterinary medicines  , which comply with other pieces of EU legislation, may be offered for sale when they reach the end of the manufacturing chain.   Animal by-products are graded in 3 categories depending on the level of health risk they pose to the public or animals. These determine how they should be disposed of or recovered.   Restrictions exist on the use of animal by-products and derived products. For instance, they may not be used to feed animals or farmed fish of the same species.   Imports of both products must satisfy EU standards.   A ban exists on the export of both products for incineration or landfill, or to countries which are not members of the  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  (OECD) for use in a biogas or composting plant.    Amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009   In 2013, the legislation was amended to give Mayotte, as a new  outermost region  of the EU, until 1 January 2021 to comply with its rules.  Some of the definitions used in the regulation (i.e. ‘transit’ and ‘competent authority’) are realigned with those used in Regulation (EU)  2017/625  (the ‘  Official Controls Regulation  ’), which lays down the rules on checks carried out along the agri-food chain. Regulation (EU) 2017/625 also ensures that animal by-products and derived products, previously not covered by the EU’s official controls legislation, now fall within its scope.  Regulation (EU)  2019/1009  which lays down  EU rules on fertilisers  , amends Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 to enable derived products no longer posing significant risks to animal health to move freely on the EU market as fertilising products.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 4 March 2011. The changes introduced by the amending Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 have applied since 15 July 2019.   background   For more information, see:    EU rules on animal by-products (ABPs)  (  European Commission  ).   key terms    Animal by-products:  entire bodies or parts of animals which are not intended for human consumption.   Derived products:  items obtained from processing of animal by-products.
summary of   Regulation (EC) No 2065/2003 — smoke flavourings for foods   what is the aim of this regulation  It sets EU-wide rules on authorising and using smoke flavourings in foods.   key points   The regulation introduces a  safety assessment and authorisation procedure  for primary smoke condensates  *  and primary tar fractions  *  which can be used in and on foods and/or for the production of derived smoke flavourings  *  .  The  primary products   *  for which no health concern is expressed during evaluation are then included in a  list of authorised products under specific conditions of use.    Authorisations  are granted for a  period of 10 years  after which they have to be  renewed  . This ensures that products are regularly re-assessed in the light of the latest scientific and technical knowledge and that authorised products, that are no longer used, are removed from the EU’s positive list.   Applicants  for the authorisation of a primary product must provide  detailed information  on:   the type of wood used for the production of the primary product;   detailed information on the production methods of the primary products and the further processing in the production of derived smoke flavourings;   the intended uses in or on specific foods or food categories;   chemical specifications;   toxicological studies; and   validated methods for sampling and detecting primary products and derived smoke flavourings.   The safety evaluation of the applications is carried out by the  European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)  according to a specific time-frame and on the basis of transparent procedures.  The application is made to EFSA, the Commission and the EU countries. If requested by the applicant, certain sensitive data may remain confidential.  The EFSA assessments on smoke flavourings are available here:  EU lists of flavourings – Scientific advice – 3 Smoke flavourings (primary products)   Commission Regulation (EC) No  627/2006  establishes quality criteria for the validated analytical methods for sampling, identification and characterisation of primary smoke products, as referred to in Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 2065/2003.   from when does the regulation apply  It has applied since 16 December 2003 apart from its Article 4(2) prohibiting the placing on the market of a smoke flavouring or food in or on which smoke flavouring is present if the flavouring has not been authorised, which has applied since 16 June 2005.   background   For more information, see:    EU rules on flavourings  (  European Commission  )    EU lists of flavourings  (  European Commission  )    Smoke flavourings  (  European Food Safety Authority  ).   key terms    Primary smoke condensates:  the purified water-based part of condensed smoke which falls within the definition of smoke flavourings.   Primary tar fractions:  the purified fraction of the water-insoluble high-density tar phase of condensed smoke which falls within the definition of smoke flavourings.   Derived smoke flavourings:  flavourings produced as a result of the further processing of primary products used in or on foods in order to impart smoke flavour to those foods.   Primary products:  primary smoke condensates and primary tar fractions.
   "Eurodac" system     "Eurodac" system     The objective of this regulation is to establish a system for comparing fingerprints of asylum seekers and some categories of illegal immigrants. It will facilitate the application of the Dublin II Regulation, which makes it possible to determine the European Union (EU) country responsible for examining an asylum application.     ACT     Council Regulation No       2725/2000      of 11 December 2000 concerning the establishment of 'Eurodac' for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of the Dublin Convention.     SUMMARY     The Eurodac system enables European Union (EU) countries to help identify asylum applicants and persons who have been apprehended in connection with an irregular crossing of an external border of the Union. By comparing fingerprints, EU countries can determine whether an asylum applicant or a foreign national found illegally present within an EU country has previously claimed asylum in another EU country or whether an asylum applicant entered the Union territory unlawfully.     Eurodac consists of a Central Unit within the Commission, equipped with a computerised central database for comparing fingerprints, and a system for electronic data transmission between EU countries and the database.     In addition to fingerprints, data sent by EU countries include:      the EU country of origin;       the sex of the person;       the place and date of the asylum application or the apprehension of the person;       the reference number;       the date on which the fingerprints were taken;       the date on which the data were transmitted to the Central Unit.      Data are collected for persons who are at least 14 years of age and are sent to the Central Unit via national access points.     In the case of asylum applicants, data are kept for ten years unless the individual obtains the citizenship of one of the EU countries, in which case their data must be immediately erased. Data relating to foreign nationals apprehended in connection with an irregular crossing of an external border are kept for two years from the date on which the fingerprints were taken. Data are immediately erased before the end of the two years if the foreign national:      receives a residence permit;       has left the territory of the Union;       has obtained citizenship of an EU country.      In the case of foreign nationals found illegally present in an EU country, it is possible to check their fingerprints against those in the central database to determine whether the individual had previously lodged an asylum application in another EU country. After the fingerprints have been transmitted for comparison purposes, they are no longer stored in Eurodac.     As regards the protection of personal data, EU countries sending data to Eurodac must ensure that the taking of fingerprints and all operations involving the processing, transmission, conservation or erasure of the data are carried out lawfully. The Commission must see to the proper application of the regulation by the Central Unit and take the necessary measures to ensure the security thereof. It also informs the European Parliament and the Council of the measures it takes.     Data processing activities of EU countries are monitored by the national supervisory bodies, while those of the Commission are monitored by the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS).     In addition to all EU countries, this regulation is applied by countries that (on the basis of international agreements) apply the       Dublin Regulation      , namely Iceland, Norway and Switzerland.

In accordance with Article 22 of the Eurodac Regulation, the Council adopted certain provisions for the transmission and comparison of fingerprints and the definition of the tasks of the Central Unit. The Central Unit defines the technical requirements for transmitting fingerprints electronically. A reference number makes it possible to relate a fingerprint to one particular person and to identify the EU country that sent the data. The number is composed of several letters and a code. EU countries ensure the transmission of fingerprints in "an appropriate quality" for the purpose of comparison.     As a general rule, the Central Unit deals with requests for comparisons within 24 hours (except in cases of emergency), in order of arrival.      Agreements       Council Decision         2008/147/EC        of 28 January 2008 on the conclusion on behalf of the European Community of the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation concerning the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the State responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State or in Switzerland [Official Journal L 53 of 27.2.2008].      With this Agreement, the provisions of the Dublin and Eurodac Regulations, as well as the related implementing regulations, are applied to Switzerland in its relations with EU countries. The Agreement, which entered into force on 1 March 2008, provides for rights and obligations between Switzerland and EU countries with regard to these regulations. In case of non-fulfilment of the obligations, the Agreement may be suspended or denounced. A mixed committee consisting of representatives of Switzerland and EU countries is established to examine the implementation and practical application of the provisions of the Dublin/Eurodac       acquis      . The exchange of letters annexed to the Agreement foresees that the meetings of the mixed committees between the EU and Iceland and Norway on the one hand (see below), and the EU and Switzerland on the other hand, will be organised jointly.

This seventh annual report on the Eurodac Central Unit presents the management and performance of the system in 2009, evaluating its output, cost-effectiveness and quality of service.     With regard to the management of the system, an upgrading of the Eurodac system is being carried out as the amount of data is constantly increasing and the technical platform is becoming obsolete, as well as due to the unpredictable trends in transaction volume.     In its Annex, the report provides statistics on applications made for asylum (category 1), apprehensions of those who have illegally crossed the external border of the Union (category 2) and those who have been found illegally present in the territory of an EU country (category 3). While transactions of both category 1 and 3 data continued the increasing trend of previous years, transactions of category 2 data dropped dramatically.     In general, the speed, output, security and cost-effectiveness of the central unit were perceived as satisfactory, but the persisting delays in the transmission of data remain a concern.

act   Joint Communication to the European Parliament and the Council - Developing a European Union policy towards the Arctic region: progress since 2008 and next steps (  JOIN(2012) 19  final of 26 June 2012).   summary    what is the aim of this joint communication  The Joint Communication of the Commission and the  High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy  (JC) demonstrates the EU’s environmental protection action in this region. It also advocates increased EU investment in global and sustainable development.   key points   In 2008, the Commission adopted a first  communication on the Arctic region  proposing an EU Arctic policy with 3 main objectives:   to protect and preserve the Arctic in cooperation with the local people;   to promote the sustainable use of resources;   to encourage international cooperation.   This 2012 joint communication reviews the EU’s contribution to the Arctic since 2008. It prepares the path for  future EU involvement in the Arctic  to jointly meet the challenges of safeguarding the environment and ensuring sustainable development.   A strategic region   The Arctic is an area of growing strategic importance. Its changing landscape is opening up  new transport lanes  and the exploitation of  natural and mineral resources,  like oil and gas. Extending from Europe to Asia, the  Northern Sea Route  could shorten the time taken by cargo vessels to travel between the Pacific and the Atlantic by about one third.  While this will be of benefit for the regional and global economy, it will also have repercussions on the Arctic’s fragile environment. This is why the JC proposes a new EU Arctic policy that focuses on 3 areas:    1.    support for  research andknowledge  to address environmental and climate change in the Arctic: the  Horizon 2020 programme  seeks broad cooperation with researchers in Arctic specialisations. A  European-Arctic information centre  has also been created to provide information about the EU’s role in the Arctic;      2.     responsible action  to ensure that economic development in the Arctic is both sustainable and based on environmental expertise. The main objective is to work with Arctic partners (including the private sector) to develop low-risk technologies that could possibly be used by the extractive and the shipping industries. The EU is also exploring innovative economic activities, such as ecotourism*;      3.     constructive engagementand dialogue  with Arctic states, indigenous peoples and other partners to increase awareness and jointly address the challenges.      EU support   Since 2008, the EU has provided over €1.14 billion developing the economic, social and environmental potential of the EU’s Arctic regions (Denmark, Finland and Sweden).  EU Structural Funds  have invested substantially in the development of the Arctic region with initiatives like the  Sápmi subprogramme  to support the cultural and industrial development of the Sami population.  The EU has also contributed around €200 million to international research in the Arctic. It is also the main contributor to the Support Fund of the  Northern Dimension Environmental Partnership  (NDEP) which supports projects in the Barents region of the Arctic.   International cooperation   The EU’s stated aims are to support the international effort to fight climate change through the use of alternative energy sources and research.  Arctic states cooperate on the basis of the  UN Convention on the Law of the Seas  . The  Arctic Council  is emerging as the  leading regional body  in which all Arctic states (Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States) as well as indigenous peoples are represented.   background   The EU is a major destination of resources (hydrocarbons and raw materials) and goods (such as fish) from the Arctic region. Its policies and legislation thus have important implications for Arctic governments, business and consumers.  For further information, see the  EU Arctic policy on the European Union’s external action service website  .   key terms    * Ecotourism:  responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment and improves the welfare of local people (the International Ecotourism Society definition).
act    Directive 2014/47/EU  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 April 2014 on the technical roadside inspection of the roadworthiness of commercial vehicles circulating in the Union and repealing Directive 2000/30/EC.   summary    what does this directive do  This Directive seeks to improve road safety and to reduce the negative environmental impacts of  commercial vehicles  . It sets out minimum requirements and harmonised rules for the  technical roadside inspection  of these vehicles within the European Union (EU).  This law was adopted alongside revised rules on  vehicle registration documents  and a new Directive on  periodic roadworthiness tests for vehicles  .   Scope   The law covers buses and coaches (categories M2 & M3), trucks (N2 & N3) and trailers of over 3,5 tonnes (O3 & O4), as well as tractors used for commercial road haulage and capable of over 40 km/h (T5).  EU countries may also carry out inspections on vehicles not covered by this law, such as light commercial vehicles, or carry out inspections in places other than public roads.   Inspections   These comprise  initial  and, where necessary,  more detailed inspections  focusing in particular on brakes, tyres, wheels and chassis, as well as nuisances (noise, exhaust emissions, etc.). The rate of inspections is expected to be proportionate to the number of vehicles registered in each EU country. The aim is for at least 5 % of all commercial vehicles registered in the EU to be inspected each year.   Inspectors   Inspectors must not discriminate on grounds of the nationality of the driver or of the country of registration when selecting a vehicle for inspection. They must be free from any conflict of interest that might compromise their impartiality, and remuneration must not be dependent on the outcome of their inspections.   Drivers' responsibilities   Drivers are required to carry on the vehicle its most recent roadworthiness certificate, as well as the most recent roadside inspection report, if available. Drivers must also cooperate with inspectors and give them access to the vehicle, its parts and documentation.   Risk-rating system   From 2019, EU countries must use risk-rating systems enabling inspectors to identify transport companies with a high risk profile so that they may be checked more closely and frequently.   Securing of cargo   The law includes principles for inspections and applicable standards for cargo securing, as well as for the assessment of defects.   Defects   Defects are classified as minor, major or dangerous. Any major or dangerous deficiency revealed by an inspection must be rectified before the vehicle is further used on public roads.   Information exchange   EU countries will each designate a contact point to ensure information exchanges and assist the contact points of other EU countries. Countries are also expected to regularly participate in  concerted roadside inspection activities  with neighbouring EU states.   when does the directive apply  This law applies from 20.5.2018.

   Motor vehicle liability insurance: freedom to provide services     Motor vehicle liability insurance: freedom to provide services     To bring compulsory third-party motor vehicle insurance within the scope of second non-life insurance Council Directive       88/357/EEC      (see summary 4.2.8a).     ACT     Council Directive       90/618/EEC      of 8 November 1990, amending, particularly as regards motor vehicle liability insurance, first Council Directive       73/239/EEC      and second Council Directive       88/357/EEC      on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to direct insurance other than life assurance.     SUMMARY     The Directive applies to the provision of third-party motor vehicle insurance by an insurer established in one Member State in respect of vehicles registered in other Member States.     Two classes of risk, namely class 10 (motor vehicle liability) and class 3 (damage to or loss of land motor vehicles or other land vehicles), are now to be included in the second Directive system which distinguishes between large risks and mass risks with corresponding degrees of supervision by home and host countries.     Classes 10 and 12 (Italian motorboat risks) are now to be included in the       freedom-of-services provisions of the second Directive      , and thus may now be covered by way of provision of services by insurers in other Member States.     A new group of classes entitled "motor insurance" is to be introduced for the keeping of gross premium statistics in respect of the business written by each insurance company by way of provision of services in a given country.     The Member State of provision of services must require the services undertaking to become a member of, and participate in the financing of, its national motor insurers' bureau and its national guarantee fund. The membership contributions should be based only on the premium income from this insurance class in the State in question or the number of vehicles insured, i.e. an annual membership fee or minimum contribution may not be required.     Insurers must appoint a representative in the Member State of provision of services, responsible mainly for collecting information and representing the insurer in relation to persons pursuing claims or seeking redress before the courts or authorities of that State. The Member State of provision of services may require the representative to help it verify the existence and validity of insurance cover.

   EU strategy for biofuels     EU strategy for biofuels     The European Union (EU) sets out seven strategic policy areas for the development of the production and use of biofuels by the Member States and developing countries.     ACT     Commission Communication of 8 February 2006 entitled "An EU Strategy for Biofuels" [       COM(2006) 34      final - Official Journal C 67 of 18 March 2006].     SUMMARY     In its Strategy, the Commission defines the role that biofuels       *      produced from biomass, a renewable resource, may play in the future as a source of renewable energy serving as an alternative to the fossil fuel energy sources (chiefly oil) used in the transport sector. It also proposes measures to promote the production and use of biofuels.     The Strategy complements the Biomass Action Plan       *      adopted at the end of 2005 and responds to a threefold objective: further promotion of biofuels in the EU and in developing countries, preparation for the large-scale use of biofuels, and heightened cooperation with developing countries in the sustainable production of biofuels. This threefold objective breaks down into seven policy areas, which encompass the priorities envisaged by the Commission.     Among the measures intended to       stimulate demand for biofuels      , the Commission intends to bring forward a report on the implementation of the Biofuels Directive and the possible revision of the Directive, stressing the importance of national targets, biofuel use obligations and ensuring sustainable production of biofuels. The Commission will also pay particular attention to the tax benefits included in the 2003 Energy Taxation Directive and the possible establishment of a regulatory framework for incentives linked to the environmental performance of individual fuels. It will continue to encourage the use of biofuels in public and private vehicle fleets. To this end, at the end of 2005 it proposed a Directive on the promotion of clean vehicles for use in road transport.     Among measures intended for       ensuring environmental benefits      , the Commission intends to highlight the advantages of biofuels in terms of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases (and in particular to link these advantages to the promotion of biofuels). In addition, it is essential to guarantee that feedstock for biofuels is produced in a sustainable manner, both in the EU and in third countries, particularly with regard to the protection of biodiversity, water pollution, soil degradation and the protection of habitats and species. Another important element that should be taken into consideration is the compatibility of technical and environmental regulations, particularly with regard to maximum quantities of biofuels in petrol and diesel.     With a view to       developing the production and distribution of biofuels      , the Member States and regions are invited to consider the opportunities offered by biofuels in terms of economic activity and job creation within the context of the cohesion policy and rural development policy. The Commission has already proposed guidelines in this respect and intends to set up an ad hoc reflection group. The Commission will ask the relevant industries to justify their use of practices that act as barriers to the introduction of biofuels and will monitor the behaviour of these industries to ensure that there is no discrimination against biofuels.     In order to ensure sustainable production of biofuels, the Commission intends to       expand feedstock supplies      . One of the measures it intends to implement is to include sugar production for the manufacture of bioethanol       *      in CAP aid schemes. In addition, it will study the possibility of processing cereals from existing intervention stocks into biofuels, finance a campaign to inform farmers and forest operators, bring forward a Forestry Action Plan and examine the possibility of using animal by-products and waste as energy sources.     In order to       enhance the trade opportunities of biofuels      , the Commission will study the possibility of establishing separate customs codes for biofuels. It also intends to pursue a balanced approach to trade negotiations with ethanol-producing countries in order to ensure sustainable development of European production and imports of biofuels, and to submit an amendment to the standard for biodiesel       *      .     The Commission also wants to       support developing countries      with potential in terms of biofuels, particularly by means of accompanying measures for countries affected by EU       sugar reform      , a specific aid programme for biofuels, and a framework for effective cooperation that would include among other things the development of national biofuel platforms and regional biofuel action plans.     Lastly, it is essential that the Commission continue to       support research and innovation      , particularly in order to improve production processes and to lower costs. The principal measures will focus on,       inter alia      , continuing with activities in the field of research and development via the       Seventh Framework Programme      for Research and Development, the full use of second generation biomass and biofuels (i.e. originating from the processing of ligno-cellulosic feedstock such as straw and forest residues). The development of industry-led European technology platforms such as the European Biofuels Technology Platform, should make it possible to establish a shared European vision and strategy for the production and use of biofuels.      Background      The two main reasons for research into renewable energy sources as an alternative to oil are:      the significant contribution of transport to emissions of greenhouse gases. Emissions resulting from transport account for 21% of the total emissions of greenhouse gases. As a result, it is necessary to use fuels that are less polluting than oil;       the need to guarantee the security of energy supplies by diversifying fuel sources. The limited quantity of available oil and the increase in prices of fossil fuels represent increasingly urgent challenges for the transport sector and for national economies.        Key terms used in the act         Biofuel: liquid or gaseous fuel used for transport produced from biomass.         Biomass: the totality of organic animal or vegetable matter. This includes in particular the biodegradable fraction of products, wastes and residues from agriculture, forestry, industry and households.         Biodiesel: a methyl-ester produced from vegetable or animal oil, of diesel quality, to be used as biofuel.         Bioethanol: ethanol production from the fermentation of plants rich in sugar/starch, to be used as biofuel.       RELATED ACTS      Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament -         Renewable energy road map        - Renewable energies in the 21st century: building a more sustainable future [         COM(2006) 848        final - Not published in the Official Journal].       Commission Report of 10 January 2007 on biofuels - Report on the progress made by EU Member States in terms of biofuels and other renewable fuels [         COM(2006) 845        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      In 2005, biofuels were used in 17 of the 21 Member States for which data were available. The Commission indicates a significant increase in market share, reaching 1% on average (it has doubled in two years). Nonetheless, this figure is below the reference value fixed at 2%. In addition, the advances have been very varied: only Germany (3.8%) and Sweden (2.2%) achieved the reference value. While biodiesel achieved a share of about 1.6% of the diesel market, ethanol achieved a share of only 0.4% of the petrol market. On the basis of different projections, the Commission considers it unlikely that Member States will achieve the 5.75% target set by the Biofuels Directive for 2010. It considers that this Directive needs to be amended, in particular by setting a mandatory target of 10% for 2010 for the EU as a whole and by promoting high-quality biofuels. The report also contains an account of the economic and environmental impact linked to the promotion of biofuels.

Commission Communication to the Council and the European Parliament on an EU Forest Action Plan [         COM(2006) 302        final - Not published in the Official Journal].      The Action Plan provides a framework for initiatives for forests in the EU, in order to support and enhance sustainable management and the multifunctional role of forests. Set to run for a period of five years (2007-11), it defines a series of key activities that must be implemented by the Commission and the Member States, including the promotion and the use of forest biomass to produce biofuels.

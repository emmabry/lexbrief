    "BART + chunking + concatenation will provide the inference baseline to compare my work against. This is the simplest method for my task of policy text summarisation, as it just involves using a pre-trained model (BART), chunking the inputs due to the 512 token limit, and then concatenating the outputs to provide a full summarisation of the policy text. ROUGE will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of this method, and these figures will be used for comparing my subsequent models to demonstrate the impact of different methods."

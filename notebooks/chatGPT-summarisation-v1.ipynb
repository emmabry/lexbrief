Certain serious manifestations of racism and xenophobia must constitute an offence in all EU countries and be punishable by effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties.  This Framework Decision applies to all offences committed:   within the territory of the European Union (EU), including through an information system;   by a national of an EU country or for the benefit of a legal person established in an EU country. To that end, the Framework Decision provides criteria on how to determine the liability of legal persons.    ‘Hate speech’   Certain forms of conduct as outlined below, are punishable as criminal offences:   public incitement to violence or hatred directed against a group of persons or a member of such a group defined on the basis of race, colour, descent, religion or belief, or national or ethnic origin;   the above-mentioned offence when carried out by the public dissemination or distribution of tracts, pictures or other material;   publicly condoning, denying or grossly trivialising crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes as defined in the Statute of the International Criminal Court (Articles 6, 7 and 8) and crimes defined in Article 6 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal, when the conduct is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred against such a group or a member of such a group.   Instigating, aiding or abetting in the commission of the above offences is also punishable.  With regard to these offences listed, EU countries must ensure that they are punishable by:   effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties;   a term of imprisonment of a maximum of at least one year.   With regard to legal persons, the penalties must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive and must consist of criminal or non-criminal fines. In addition, legal persons may be punished by:   exclusion from entitlement to public benefits or aid;   temporary or permanent disqualification from the practice or commercial activities;   being placed under judicial supervision;   a judicial winding-up order.   The initiation of investigations or prosecutions of racist and xenophobic offences must not depend on a victim’s report or accusation.   ‘Hate crime’   In all cases, racist or xenophobic motivation shall be considered to be an aggravating circumstance or, alternatively, the courts must be empowered to take such motivation into consideration when determining the penalties to be applied.

      "Gold Summary: Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) (2007-2013)     Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) (2007-2013)     Reflecting the objectives of the Lisbon strategy, the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme CIP supports measures to strengthen competitiveness and innovation capacity in the European Union (EU) for the period 2007-2013. It particularly encourages the use of information technologies, environmental technologies and renewable energy sources.     ACT     Decision       1639/2006/EC      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 2006 establishing a Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (2007-2013) [       See amending act(s)      ].     SUMMARY     The Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) proposes a coherent framework to improve competitiveness       *      and innovation capacity       *      in the European Union (EU). The actions it supports encourage the development of a knowledge society and sustainable development based on balanced economic growth.     The framework programme incorporates specific Community support programmes, new actions and synergies with other programmes, thus meeting the objectives of the       renewed Lisbon Strategy      for simpler, more visible and better targeted Community action.      Specific programmes      To take account of the diversity of its objectives and ensure that these are visible, the CIP is made up of three specific subprogrammes. The interests of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and eco-innovation are cross-cutting priorities reflected throughout the framework programme.       The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme        brings together activities to promote entrepreneurship, industrial competitiveness and innovation. It specifically targets SMEs         *        , from hi-tech “gazelles” (companies with high growth potential) to the traditional micro-businesses and family firms which make up a large majority of European enterprises. It facilitates SMEs’ access to finance and investment during their start-up and growth phase. It also gives businesses access to information and advice on the functioning and opportunities of the internal market, as well as to information on Community legislation applying to them and on future legislation so that they can prepare to adapt in a cost-effective way. In this context, the         Enterprise Europe Network        plays an important role. The programme also makes provision for the exchange of best practices between Member States in order to create a better regulatory and administrative environment for business and innovation. Finally, it backs the promotion of eco-innovation         *        by encouraging efforts to tap the full potential of environmental technologies.       The         objective of the ICT Policy Support Programme        is to promote the adoption and use of information and communication technologies (ICT), the backbone of the knowledge economy. The uptake of ICTs by both the private and public sectors helps to stimulate European innovation performance and competitiveness. The programme forms part of the         Digital Agenda for Europe        and incorporates the instruments previously financed by the eTen, eContent and Modinis programmes.       The         Intelligent Energy – Europe Programme        helps speed up efforts to achieve the objectives in the field of sustainable energy. It supports improvements in energy efficiency, the adoption of new and renewable energy sources, greater market penetration for these energy sources, energy and fuel diversification, an increase in the share of renewable energy (the EU has set itself the objective of raising the share of renewable energy in gross domestic consumption to 12 % by 2010) and a reduction in final energy consumption. Particular attention is paid in this context to the transport sector. The programme follows up the         Intelligent Energy – Europe (2003-2006)        programme, which expired on 31 December 2006.       Implementation      Implementation of the CIP relies on several instruments (financial instruments, projects, networks, analyses, etc.), which can be applied in each of the specific programmes. This common “toolbox” for the different programmes helps to simplify the way the framework programme works for its users. The CIP is not just based on tried and tested measures, but also introduces new instruments.     Several Community financial instruments are involved in business support. The High Growth and Innovative SME Facility (GIF) promotes the supply of seed and early-stage capital for SMEs for their start-up, and a new feature introduced by the CIP is the provision of “follow-on” capital during their growth phase. The SME Guarantee Facility, for its part, facilitates access for SMEs to financing (loans or leasing), microcredit and equity or quasi-equity. This facility also includes a new securitisation instrument for bank loan portfolios to help mobilise additional loan financing for SMEs.     The CIP strengthens and develops business and innovation support services which disseminate information to businesses on Community policies, legislation and programmes, particularly concerning the internal market and framework research programmes. These services also offer businesses information on innovation, technology and knowledge transfer and provide feedback from them for impact assessments and policy development.     A new mechanism fosters cooperation among national and regional programmes to promote business innovation, thus providing businesses with other ways of benefiting from ideas, know-how and market opportunities in other European regions.     The framework programme also supports pilot market replication projects. These aim to promote the effective marketing and economic exploitation of innovative or eco-innovative technologies and products which have already been technically demonstrated with success but have not yet penetrated the market to a significant extent. These projects are implemented through public-private partnerships.     The Intelligent Energy Executive Agency is responsible for the implementation of action under the “Intelligent Energy – Europe” programme and action under the “Enterprise and Innovation” programme.     In order to optimise the flow of knowledge and ideas, the strategic development of Community policies must continue on the basis of the open method of coordination and be backed up by new twinning actions to help Member States and regions exploit examples of best practice.      Consistency with other Community policies      The CIP links up with other key Community initiatives. Their different activities are implemented in parallel and complement each other. The framework programme is thus involved in achieving Community objectives in the fields of research, cohesion, the environment, education and training.     The CIP thus facilitates access to finance for businesses whose activities relate to innovation, research and development. It also helps businesses get involved in the       7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development      (FP7-RTD).      Budget      The framework programme will run for seven years, from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013. It has been allocated a budget of €3.621 billion for that period.     According to an indicative breakdown, 60 % of the overall budget (€2.170 billion) is allocated to the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme. One fifth of this (€430 million) is earmarked for promoting eco-innovation. 20 % of the overall budget (€730 million) has been allocated to the ICT Policy Support Programme, and the last 20 % (€730 million) is for the Intelligent Energy – Europe Programme.     Costs that are eligible under several instruments cannot be funded twice.      Monitoring and assessment      The Commission carries out regular monitoring of the implementation of the framework-programme and the specific programmes which come under it. Each year it drafts a report to provide an update of the activities supported using indicators concerning the financial implementation, the results achieved and, where possible, the impact of the actions implemented.     The framework-programme and the specific programmes which come under it are subject to an intermediary assessment and a final assessment. These assessments examine aspects such as the relevance, the coherence and synergies, effectiveness, the efficient use of resources, and the sustainability, etc. of the actions. Furthermore, the final assessment verifies to what extent the framework-programme as a whole, and each of its specific individual programmes, have achieved their objectives.      Context      The       Lisbon Process      , whose objective is to make Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, has naturally made competitiveness one of the EU’s key political concerns. In order to ensure greater coherence between the different programmes involved in the Community’s efforts to enhance competitiveness, and in response to the objectives set by the renewed Lisbon Strategy, the European Commission is proposing a framework programme for innovation and competitiveness.       Key terms used in the act         Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)           :          Competitiveness: the capacity of enterprises to adapt quickly to change, exploit their innovation potential and develop high-quality products.         Innovation: renewal and extension of the range of products and services, introduction of new design, production, supply and distribution methods, introduction of changes to management methods, work organisation and employees’ terms and conditions of employment and qualifications.         Eco-innovation: any form of innovation intended to achieve the objective of sustainable environmentally-friendly development by reducing the impact on the environment or by using natural resources, especially energy, in a more efficient and responsible manner.

      "Gold Summary: summary of   Communication (COM(2004) 130 final) - Integration of Environmental Aspects into European Standardisation   what is the aim of the communication  It seeks to ensure that environmental aspects are integrated more systematically into European standards and that all those involved in compiling these standards take environmental protection into account.   key points     European standardisation  makes it possible to apply harmonised technical standards among the countries of the European Union (EU). It thus facilitates trade in the single market.   Standardisation plays a part in the formulation of EU policies and the dissemination of technical knowledge. By integrating environmental aspects, standards can thus contribute to  sustainable development  and the associated EU policies.    Developments in European standardisation    European standards are voluntary documents compiled by the European or international standards organisations. This work is based on a proactive process and on a consensus among all stakeholders.   The process of compiling standards is conducted under the  new approach  to technical harmonisation and standardisation.   Standardisation covers an increasing number of sectors. It is considered to be a useful tool for environmental protection, in that it:   has an influence on the way products and services impact on the environment, particularly in the context of the  Circular Economy action plan  ;   implements standardised test methods and methods of measurement in order to facilitate the enforcement of environmental legislation. This is the case with horizontal standards used to simplify the measurement of levels of pollutants in sludge, as well as in soil or biowaste;   promotes the use of environmental technologies and supports initiatives which have environmental benefits. Standardisation can, for example, help in the marketing of technologies such as micro-cogeneration which makes it possible to simultaneously develop heat and electricity in a building;   draws up environmental management standards which aim to improve the environmental performance of businesses, such as the International  Organisation for Standardisation (ISO)  14000 series of international standards.     Europe’s ability to create environmental standards can lead to the development of international standards.    Environmental standards    The environmental quality of the standards produced in the EU can be improved. Particular attention is also focused on the quality of the standards drawn up in the acceding countries. The main aim is to:   improve the environmental training of the experts who compile or revise European standards and allow all stakeholders access to environmental information. The dissemination of technical know-how should be encouraged at European and national level;   set priorities regarding the topics to be dealt with, taking into account issues of public interest related to EU environmental policy. The  European Commission  can use the European standardisation mandate to flag these priorities;   promote the active participation of all parties concerned by standardisation. The European standardisation bodies such as the  European Committee for Standardisation (CEN)  and  the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation (CENELEC)  work on the basis of national delegations. The EU countries should thus support participation by civil society and the scientific community in the process of drawing up standards. The Commission is pursuing the same objective by working together with the  ECOS consortium  of environmental organisations;   make systematic use of tools which help integrate environmental aspects into standardisation. Regular meetings will be held to exchange experience and assess the progress made.      Incentives    The Commission wishes to encourage systematic use of the most effective integration tools. The European standardisation bodies have developed specific tools such as:   working groups dedicated to the environment;   technical advisory boards;   environmental databases;   sectoral guides and checklists written by experts for experts.     Stakeholders in the standardisation process become involved voluntarily. In order to ensure the proliferation of environmental standards, it is also necessary to enhance their market relevance.   background    When the  Sixth Community Environment Action Programme  was adopted in 2002, the Commission proposed that environmental protection be taken into consideration in standardisation activities.   This communication was drawn up following an Internet consultation. Representatives from business and industry, NGOs, public authorities and standardisation organisations had the opportunity to voice their opinions on the best way of taking action for the environment.   The Commission’s circular economy communication highlights the importance of standards to support the creation of a more circular economy. In particular, there is a need to develop standards in a number of priority areas, such as   material efficiency standards to support the implementation of the  Ecodesign Directive  ,   standards for secondary raw materials, as well as on material efficient recycling of electronic waste, waste batteries and other relevant complex end-of-life products.

      "Predicted Summary: Commission Regulation (EC) No 308/2008 sets out the official format that EU Member States must use to notify the European Commission of their training and certification programmes for personnel and companies handling certain fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases), as required under Regulation (EC) No 842/2006. The regulation aims to ensure consistency and mutual recognition of certifications across Member States, enhancing environmental protection through proper handling of F-gases. It provides standardised notification forms covering five key areas: stationary refrigeration, air conditioning, and heat pump systems; stationary fire protection systems and fire extinguishers; high-voltage switchgear; equipment using F-gas-based solvents; and motor vehicle air-conditioning systems. Each form requires details on the certification or training programmes, including titles and responsible bodies. By harmonising the way Member States report these schemes, the regulation supports effective implementation of EU-wide standards and facilitates mobility of certified professionals within the internal market.\n",
      "Gold Summary: act   Communication from the Commission on the promotion of inland waterway transport ‘NAIADES’ - an integrated European action programme for inland waterway transport (  COM(2006) 6  final of 17 January 2006).   summary   Inland waterways can make a major contribution to a sustainable European Union transport system, reducing congestion and pollution on Europe’s roads. However, national and EU-level initiatives are needed to develop its full potential.   what does the communication do  It presents an integrated strategy to make the use of inland navigation more attractive and feasible. The action programme ‘Navigation and inland waterway action and development in Europe’ (NAIADES) focuses on 5 strategic areas.   key points    Markets: opportunities should be developed, particularly in niche areas such as the transport of waste, dangerous goods, extremely large loads and river-sea-shipping.   Fleet: continuous investment in modernisation and innovation are necessary to improve vessel design, reduce fuel consumption and improve safety technology.   Jobs and skills: better working and social conditions, allied to appropriate education and training facilities, should encourage people to work in the sector.   Image: inland navigation’s outdated image should be improved and modernised so it accurately reflects the technological performance that has been achieved.   Infrastructure: a European development plan could remove the many bottlenecks which exist such as low bridges and narrow locks. This should be accompanied by modernisation of the overall organisational structure to remove administrative hurdles.   In 2013, the Commission updated the NAIADES programme (  NAIADES II  ), setting out specific objectives up to 2020. Its aim is to create the conditions for inland navigation to become a quality form of transport.  In 2014, the EU adopted  legislation  to enable governments to take measures to improve the sector’s competitiveness through early retirement schemes, wider use of innovation and training and safety programmes.   background   Over 37,000 kilometres of waterways and hundreds of inland ports connect many of Europe’s most important industrial areas. This network can play an important sustainable role as the volume of freight transport continues to grow.  For more information, see the European Commission  Inland waterways  website.\n",
